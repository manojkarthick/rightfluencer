you listen mister just cut that part out what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we are doing a highly requested review on a brand new highlighter that is about to hit the market in Jesus H am i excited about today because not only is this a first of its kind in the makeup industry it is supposed to be blinding and you can put it everywhere on your face your ass your cheekbones your testicles and your whole entire body so we might just do that in a minute we are talking about the brand new far sadly highlighter holy let's open this bad bitch up so of course this was sent to me it comes with a first of all I love the packaging that it came with okay it's like hi and it has of course all the tidbits about what is supposed to do but let's take this bad boy out because this has gone a little bit viral all over Instagram and I have gotten so many messages to try this out and review it so here is what the beautiful component looks like of course the brand's logo is on top with the this isn't a compact this is kind of like a jar I guess we'll call it on the back it says jelly beam illuminator and this is shade glazed so of course I'm sure they're gonna put out more shades but here is the first initial one with a crazy brand new formula that I guess is really the first of its kind for highlighting all right so of course it screws off and there is the lid there is some product on the top of course and here's what the inside looks like you see it shaking right there I don't want to tip it over but we will show a little bit but see it oh it moves baby no this is not a liquid like it's not gonna just rain out it does have like a jello like consistency so I don't want touched yet all right now most of you have heard of farce sadly before because they create the rose gold elixir which of course went viral everywhere last year and a lot of youtubers and makeup artists use it now there's also the unicorn essence of course which I even used in previous videos for a primer I love this for a primer and their brand is really cool because they are starting out small and they were they are really like getting to know their audience from a consumer standpoint you know they've had one really huge hit product they created a second one that's been a hit now moving on to makeup products which I am really excited for but does it work is it a flop is it a hit is it Jeffrey's are approved we're about to find out in a minute so this guy is going to retail for a $40 so yes this is a luxury highlighter I know a lot of you are gonna be like this is a more of a luxury item of course so this basically is an innovative highlighter that apply is like a gel but sess like a powder hmm okay that's interesting leaving behind the elusive wet satin glow forget locking your cream in liquid with powder for a no-slip finish all right so what makes this product so special this is supposed to be infused with far Sally's skincare DNA with some nice ingredients to hydrate and moisturize and we're supposed to be really radiated but this says get your sunglasses ready jellybeans concentrated buildable pigmentation takes your look from lit from within to show-stopping beaming glaze in every level of luminous luminous in between alright this is this is a lot of claims so let's see if this works also it says you can mix us in with your favorite foundation for customized radiance you can put it on your shoulders your arms your legs for full body bling I might have Nathan rub this all over my naked body all right let's get to applying so this says that it could be applied on the high points of your cheeks with a finger or blend it out with a brush so we can use patting motions or brush maybe we'll just do both and then it says you can put it in your foundation you can mix it with a bunch of stuff oh my god work you can even put it on your eyelids curl alright so let's go in with our fingers first I'm going to open this one more time and okay I've been dying to touch this haven't tried it yet so I'm sitting here like mmm-hmm I just want to go it really bad okay so oh okay it's not cold but it feels cooling and then you guys see that let's do a little soot one more woah oh my god that's a lot I feel like this could last you a long time because look at my finger okay I don't wanna put too much so let's start a little smaller who knows what the hell is about to happen so let's just go in of course you guys I have no primer on just foundation powder concealer and blush contour of course so let's put this right on our cheekbones whoa oh wow okay so I am going to just Pat this in with my finger holy obviously this is not blended out yet but girl look in the monitor I'm like that is beaming holy  okay let the buffer out before it's too late a lot of the times you guys creams or liquids dry very quickly so you want to move fast so you don't end up with a streaky looking application which I might be doing right now but let's try okay it's looking a little straight not streaky it's looking a little like a better blend quick there we go okay so the good news is it doesn't dry instantly it gives you a little wiggle room right now to blend it out now you guys know I'm not really about finger applications but sometimes the hands do you good okay so now that we've really padded this into the skin let's take a step back and take a peek so of course here is one side very matte very clean and then here is the jelly bean highlighter it's definitely giving me that wet highlight appearance which I live for like I just got dunked in like gold liquid I just came out of the shower like good morning should we keep going let's keep going okay so now let's take a tiny bit more here we go mm BAM I'm scared okay I put I see that that's a little oh and let's highlight our Cupid's bow let's just do a little bit and see what happens oh wow okay this is actually really really pigmented because girl I have barely touching this and it's like good thing is the more you rub it in it does diffuse a little bit so if you're like holy should I put too much you definitely have time to manipulate the product and move it around yeah okay so there we a little Cupid's bow we got the cheek to him girl okay now I definitely want to try this side with a brush this is the morphe y 14 from the gold chrome collection so let's see what happens when you take a brush and you go like this okay it wants to stick to it and it's definitely sticking so there's what it looks like I just barely dunked it and I didn't do like a full full thing because we already know my cheeks are gonna look crazy so there is what the tip of the brush looks like right there all right you guys let's give this a whirl and see how it applies oh okay may it put too much on so before this dries I'm gonna take this in the back of my hand and just huh whoa come on highlight let's blend this out with this brush and see what the hell happens whoa okay with the brush you see how that got a little weird so let me just blend this down and then I'm gonna take my finger and manipulate the product some more well of how blinding this side looks already okay because that the brush was not completely soaked some of it kind of flicked right there what you guys can see so I'm just gonna take my damn Beauty Blender and just go over that definitely the brush did that okay I love how the top part looks I just think it looks a little funny right here so I'm gonna go in with my finger a tiny bit see that right there in the middle finger I am just going to buff that in with mice there we go alright so there we have it BAM all right let's compare sides alright so here's the side of course apply directly with a finger I love how this looks I think actually blended it I think better than the brush type let's go over here so the brush of course has these little little little hairs so we're gonna zoom in right here on these bristles the problem is is these end bristles right here flicked the product on up so when you first saw that I'm sure a lot of you were like what the but with my finger I did blend it in and fix it I just think that maybe that was not the correct brush and the finger actually worked better which is shocking I did not think that was going to happen but it did and this looks really pretty am I looking in the monitor like alright now let's go outside too quickly and show you how this looks on the body all right let's head outside alright you guys we are outside now of course the Sun is beaming directly in my eyes but here is a highlighter in the direct Sun I'm trying not to go blind here but it looks beautiful I'm looking in the reflection of my phone like June looks very like I love it okay so I'm going to take the product of course and we're gonna put it on our body and see how this looks so let's open her up alright so I just grabbed a little morphe fan brush this is the 510 you all know I've been using this since day one on my channel and I'm just going to take a little bit just like that and let's just see how this applies to my arm now I did put some on my hand already but here is the product of course on the arm now would not use this brush really to blend I'm just showing you guys how this looks oof I love the luminosity alright now I'm gonna take a little bit with my finger I just took some product directly from the top right there this is my of course finger and let's just do this side whoa you guys see that so you can do really crazy intense or more sheer down you guys know I'm more into the intense highlight look this is really easy to blend yeah I think fingers is pretty good with this product because look at that mm-hmm I'm gonna do a little bit more on my hands see when you rub it in right there now it says that you can mix this with the lotion of course but why bother I don't want to share it down grow on a glow from outer space I'm like I want to like do a nude photo shoot really soon and just douse my body in this alright I don't have any sunscreen on and I feel like I'm aging as we speak so let's go back inside the studio alright you guys we are back in the studio I am covered in highlighter obviously this is an easy review I think we tried out the highlighter I can honestly give my my thoughts already like girl this is bomb how about that there's some feedback there's my first impressions so how was it okay so look at my cheeks girl blinding love it I love this I love this I love this this looks so pretty in the Sun in the studio lights of course it's still really cute but definitely it was blinding outside and I am obsessed with that I'm like okay for summer they need to come out with like 20 more shades so get on it thank you final thoughts you guys the Far Sally jelly beam illuminator as of course jeffree star approved hey definitely a product I love it is innovative it is cute and now the only thing I know people are gonna probably complain about is the price but girl if you're gonna try something new that's innovative get over it no don't really get over it if you don't like it and because it's too much money girl there's a whole other world of highlighters out there in the drugstore but for something that is brand new I don't really have a lot of Megan like there's nothing negative to say about it the thing worked it worked - girl look at these cheeks hmm now I do want to use this of course in a tutorial coming up because I'm dying to douse the jelly beam all over my entire lid and give it that wet metal look we all know I love glitter but this could be next level so long story short the highlighter worked I love it and I can't wait to dust my entire body with it I kind of want to take it and rub it on Nathan's privates as well just to give it that saving Ryan's privates feel alright thank you so much for watching this review hopefully you learned something new today because I am obsessed with this already I'm looking in the monitor like every angle is so ready alright you guys thank you so much for watching this review I will see you on the next one 
What’s up everyone. Welcome back to my channel. Today…look at all these damned brushes! What the fuck are you doing, Jeffree? Today we are about to try the
world’s most expensive highlighters.  Oh my God. Girl.
Or the most expensive highlighter brushes. Or that.
What’s up with these. So, today we’re gonna try out
some crazy-ass highlighters. We have the most luxurious brands
 that we have found around the world who have the highest priced highlighters and I’m like, girl.
These are insane. Insane.
Now, some of them are illuminating powders. Some of them are blinding highlighters, allegedly. So we’re just gonna dive in. And of course, we have Laura Lee in the building. What’s up, guys! The hillbilly’s back. Hiii-ya! Let me do it. I'm going to love it Hiii-ya! Hiii-ya! On Laura Lee’s channel we tried out…what did we try out? We tried out the Hidden Foundation, guys, this
 is the craziest stuff ever. It’s some weird shit,  let’s just say that.
Yeah, so. Also, I’m gonna just quickly say this, the
 Manny MUA Jeffree Star Cosmetics Bundle Box returns May 13th, 10AM Pacific Standard Time. Okay, QVC, let’s roll. Okay. Alright, besides that shameless plug, if you wanna see
 us test out some crazy motherfucking highlighters,  then keep on watching. Alright, so Laura, let’s just start
off with the most expensive one. That’s exactly what we should do.
That’s what they’re here for. I mean, I’m all of it. So this is the La Mer, The Illuminating Powder.  Now I will say this about La Mer. It is one of my favorite skincare brands. It is one of my favorite foundation formulas.  Look at that bottle, it’s almost empty already. Now they have some of the most
 amazing products on the market. But this guy, what’s the retail for her? Ooh, this is $130. It sure fucking is. Good Lord, for one highlighter? But let me be honest, before we even
unbox it, it’s heavy, bitch, it is heavy. So, let’s see here, there’s no instructions, great. Okay, great! So it comes in this gorgeous uni-carton. It looks something like that.
Oh my God, it’s in a pouch. Oh. Okay, so it comes in this beautiful,
luxurious, like felt, packaging. And the highlighter itself, whoa.  Wait, open it, I feel something else is in there. Okay, so it looks something
like this. It’s beautiful packaging. What is that, a brush? A nice little brush.
Oh, cute. Okay, let’s open her up, I’ve never seen this before. Ooh. Oh, whoa, it’s like this crazy, it
almost looks like a color corrector.  So, it has like lavender, orange
and white like little triangles in there. And for this price, I will say this, of
course La Mer’s a bougie-ass brand, you’re gonna pay for the name. Everything today you’re paying
 for the name as well as the formula. Okay, so this was on the mirror, a little plastic protector. Great, get off of me, don’t touch me, where did it fall? Right in your crotch. What does this product even say that it’s supposed to do?  Usually La Mer comes with a booklet.
Where the hell’s the booklet? This is a lightweight, shimmering pressed
powder infused with illuminating gemstones, brilliant pearls and color-true pigments that provide
 all complexions with a healthy, luminous glow. Mmm, okay.
That’s a big statement. Eeeish Like, sometimes people read me the filth
for like not using the brush that it comes with, but who ever uses the brush that it comes with? I don’t.
This is literally a basic-ass like, I mean, I don’t like how it would
even probably distribute the powder. Right. So we have a bunch of highlighter brushes
 today, let’s just pick up…this is yours? Uh-huh. Okay, we’ll use the same one. What is this, the Morphe…?
This is the Morphe 510. 510. Okay, so we’re gonna both dive in here. First of all let’s take the brush—I’m nervous to
 put my brush in that. Let me swirl once. Yeah.  It’s so pretty. It looks a little dull. I’m just gonna keep it real. It kind of just
looks like a little purple’s on your brush. Okay, so let me just swirl it around. Let’s both try it on our right cheek bone. Alright. Here we go. It’s pretty.  I mean, look at that. I’m going to go ahead and say it’s not $130 pretty. Oh, you’re already saying that?
Yeah, I’m just jumping right in. Okay, she’s diving in.
Let me get a little more. This definitely has luminosity to it. Yeah, for sure, but it’s not like that banging
 highlight that you can see. It’s not blinding. Like you wouldn’t see this in an Instagram picture.
Now, most of you watching are gonna be like,  okay, if it’s $130, it better pay my car insurance
 and it better keep my cheeks fucking blinding. Agreed. Layer three, I’m taking it higher to my hairline. So if you’re a super natural girl who likes
 the light highlight, you might like this. I mean, I don’t know about $130 though. Yeah. If you’re a bougie-ass bitch that likes a subtle glow, and maybe you’re on the road outside
 of Beverly Hills, you might want this. You might want this. But umm.. Okay. And that sums
 it up. That’s about it, huh? Love the compact though. Everything. Everything.
That is like stunning. It looks so gorgeous.  I almost wish it was bigger too, like… Yeah, like the Dior? Mm hmm. It’s a little small. Yeah.
Okay, great. Alright, the next highlighter we’re about to try out.  Well I’ve used this one. So it’s not really cheating, Laura’s
never even fucking seen this shit before. Uh-uh. I don’t think I’ve ever used that.
So this is the new Tom Ford Sheer Highlighting Duo, and it’s in the shade, Reflects Gilt, which, I love that name.  So it comes in this gorgeous compact. So pretty. It’s a little more lightweight than the La Mer, obviously.
Oh yeah for sure, it feels super lightweight actually. It does. I wish they would have
 added a weight to it or something. Yeah. Okay. And it looks something like this. That looks so pretty. Now I will say this. I love a metallic.  I used this in a tutorial once and
 I took it to London a few weeks ago  and I layered it with like five other things
because I have some highlighting problems. inaudible 5:04 We know you do.
 So I’m excited to try this by itself. This one retails for how much? This one is $78. Whoo. Whoo. Whoo. Jesus H That is…78.…crazy. Description. Cheek, eyes in Reflects Gilt. A pair of shimmering rose… yeah, that’s kinda boring. Yeah, let’s get to the good part.
Get something else.  It’s gonna give a light-reflecting
finish to bronzed, glowing skin.  A versatile cheek and face highlighter. Hmm. Okay. Apply wet for soft—wait, what? The shades can be applied wet for a soft
veil of color, or dry for a sweeping pop. When it’s wet, wouldn’t it be more intense? I mean, that’s how normal things work, but… So, why is it saying a soft veil
of color? That’s interesting. Okay, whatever you say.
You know what’ll be cool?  Maybe you try it dry and I’ll just wet my brush. Perfect.
And let’s see if they’re lying or not.  Okay, you dip in first.
I kinda want the gold, huh? I’m gonna go in.  I’m gonna get a lot.
And then do your left cheek. Okay. Ooh, yes.  Uh, what the hell? Girl!
That ain’t sheer. I’m just gonna say it. I’m just gonna say it for you.
That is super intense.  Beautiful actually.
It’s stunning. It’s so intense.
Whoa. And you dipped in once.  In the La Mer I dipped in like four or five times.
Do I wanna try it wet? I’m scared. I don’t know. It’s so pretty.
Okay, we’re trying it wet. We’re trying it wet. A little Fix Plus, let’s dip in here. Okay, here we go, ready? Oh. Yeah, that’s pretty intense. Oh, wow.
Yeah. How does it look?
It looks stunning.  It’s pretty intense.
It’s blinding. Let me do a little more. I swear to God, you
 guys, on the back of this thing it says, Sheer. God, I don’t know what they’re talking about. This ain’t sheer. And Tom Ford does have some sheer products
 on the market but this is not one of them. No. And I don’t like sheer so I’m
pleasantly surprised at how blinding this is. You know what’s weird is I almost feel like it did apply… I do too.
…more blinding, dry. Me too. I do too.
I am so shocked. And I’ve never seen a product do that before. No. It’s like less glowy on mine.
I mean, it’s fucking glowing. Yes, for sure, but I felt like…
But usually when it’s wet… Yeah, It more easily applied,
 more blinding, with my dry. It did. Wow. Weird. Okay. Okay, Tom Ford, you’re not that bad. The next brand that we’re going to
try in highlighter is from Burberry.  Look at the pan though, girl.
 Just get ready, it’s cute, it’s cute. Ooh.
I love that design. It’s so cute. It looks like lace. Right? So this is the Fresh Glow Highlighter, retailing at $68. I mean, it’s Burberry. Yea It’s Burberry.
Yes, I love Burberry. Actually I had some of their
 bronzers and they’re fabulous. They’re amazing.
Yeah. They’re good. Yeah, I’ve tried some of their
 stuff on my channel before.  It’s very hit or miss, just like a lot of luxury…  I mean, I feel like when a fashion brand
makes make-up it’s never like amazing. Yeah Some good, some bad. So, let’s talk about this product. Allegedly this is a lightweight, illuminating powder
 with an intricate lace-pattern. Thank you.  Already said that. So what it does, it is supposed to give you a Burberry glow. A luminous shade fuses flattering, subtle highlighting
 with a runway-inspired yet effortless strobe. Your complexion is illuminated and your features are defined by
 sweeping the pearly, translucent powder across the areas of your face
where light would naturally hit. These descriptions are the most. They’re dramatic. They’re fucking dramatic.
 The absolute most. Okay So it says, apply it around the edges of the face.  Oh wow, temple, center, cheeks,
 nose, anything you want, cupid’s bow.  It also can be applied to your eyes, décolletage
and your arms for a flattering glow. How cool.
Alright. Shall we do our ear, like Bretman? Yeah.
I kinda want to. Yeah, Bretman does the whole fucking ear lobe. That’s really cool. I kinda live for it. It’s sickening.  Okay cool. Shout out to you, Booboo. Okay, so, I don’t wanna ruin the fucking mirror. Yeah. I’m gonna put it on top of this cheek
because this one is purple over here. Okay, so you guys, where the
La Mer was, she’s getting covered. Yes. Okay cool. I have another clean highlighter brush. I have the Y14 from Morphe. Ooh, that’s a lot of fucking pigment. Whoa, so you go in light handed. Shit.
Oh my God. Alright, let’s roll. Ooh, I’m excited about this one. Okay. I mean like you can literally just
see this like melt onto my skin. Oh my God, it’s melting, it really is. Wow, look at that! Whoa! It’s like a fucking mirror. Burberry don’t even play, honey.
I'm taking it again. Fuck me. I really like the color too, it makes your skin just look wet. Yes. It’s just like a champagne pearly like pink. Ooh. So pretty. And this is in shade Pink Pearl. Well there you go.
Alright. Well there you go Are we doing our ear?
Yeah. I’m gonna do my ear. Why is it so pretty? I wouldn’t have thought
 to do the ear. Thank you, Bretman. Right? Come on. So it’s Hawaiian secrets. All those island secrets. Mm hmm. Okay, wow. Burberry. I mean, $68, I don’t even care cause I’m in love with it.
Uh-uh, I love it. If you want a blinding, blinding highlight, And there’s like four more shades
 so there’s probably one for everyone. Okay, wow.
I love it. I’m really impressed.
I’m all about it. Okay. Next one.
Whoo. Whoo, I’m like not over this.
Oh my God, I know! What can beat it? Let’s try it. Alright, what’s next? I just wanna highlight my whole body with that. Okay, next is the Diorskin Nude Air Luminizer. This is 001. Okay, there’s four shades and this is a whopping $56.  Ooh, the pan’s pretty. It looks blinding in the pan.
She’s so pretty. It sure does. Now this is a highlighting powder with a highly-
concentrated formula with illuminating pigments. So it’s going to give you an, oh, so this says,
 with its virtually imperceptible texture, Diorskin reveals glowing skin for
a radiantly luminous complexion. It all says the same shit.
It’s supposed to glow, okay? Fuck. Where shall we put this? Cupid’s bone?
I wanna put it right here, huh? Ooh. On the collar bones?
Don’t you think? Yeah Okay. And then you do your nose and cupid’s bone. Amazing. Dip in. Feels a little the same, huh? Yeah it does.
The powderiness. Now the compact looks metal but it is a plastic,
so it’s not as heavy as the La Mer one. It has a little magnet closing, which I love. Okay, cool, let’s try the nose and
 cheeks, let’s see… I wanna see you first. Oh. Oh yeah, that’s pretty. Holy fucking collarbones.
 I want more. Give me more.
Hmm, work. I’m gonna put it over my fucking lip gloss. Ready for this? Yeah, that’s pretty.
Uh-huh. I would say the Burberry’s more intense. Okay, let me try some where they can actually
see. Let me do the tip of my nose. I think the Burberry one is a little more blinding. Yeah. For sure. But this is really pretty
 for someone that likes to be glowy,  but not like, oh my God, screaming in your face glow. Yes. I think this is perfect. Not obsessed but I do love it. I love Dior, it’s one of my favorite
beauty brands as well as fashion. This is really pretty though, I would
probably wet the brush for this one and just go ham.
See now that, yeah,  that’s the one you wanna wet
the brush on. For sure, right? Well, I’m gonna try it.
Yeah. That’s right. Okay, let’s try it. Here we go with the wetness.
Sometimes the powder gets weird. Oh. Ooh. Okay. No, I think this one’s gonna be like super intense. See that pigment in that brush? Oh yeah. Oh my God, look at the middle. Ooh. Oh, look at that bone. Oh my God. I love it.
That’s like intense. Whoa, look at that. Okay, we have, we have one more to try. Yeah  Let’s give her a whirl. And the last highlighter that we’re
gonna try today is from BECCA.  Now this is the new Shimmering Skin
Perfector, Pressed, Prismatic Amethyst.  Now the box is really like, holosexual, I am living for that. It’s so cool. Hopefully the powder looks the same or I’m gonna scream.
It’s so cool. Hopefully the powder looks the same or I’m gonna scream. So this is a Lavender Duo Chrome
 highlighter, is what the website says. Let’s have you unbox her. Now this says, like a spotlight for your skin, this will light up your favorite features
with a high impact ultra reflective shine. That’s a bold statement. It says, inspired by the dazzling light of the midday sun. This iconic formula is enriched with ultra
 fine luminescent pearls that absorb, reflect and refract light to amplify your natural radiance. It better change my life. Okay. Oooh
So, here she is. She kinda looks like lavender, a little white too. It looks really pale. Okay, cute. Yeah, it looks a little pale, huh. Okay.
Okay. Oh. Wow. That’s some fall out, bitch. Major.
Fall out. Alright. Duo? I mean, okay, it looks kinda duo-chromy. Where am I gonna put mine? Yeah, very air dusty. Oh, that’s a lot of powder.
Yeah, look at that. Come on, fall out city. Alright.
Okay. So, yeah, what are you gonna do? I might do my lids and like…
I’m kinda running out of room. Me too. Okay, let me see you first, go ahead. Oh. It looks like white powder, honestly, kinda. It’s a little chalky.
It looks like chalky. It has a little bit of pearlescence
 but I wouldn’t say duo chrome. No.
I think that’s kind of like… Mm mm. Okay, let me try it on my eyelid. Ready for this? This is the most—I mean, I don’t
have anywhere to put it, you guys. Let me try it right here. I’m reaching.  Oh wow, it’s a lot of flake. Shit. Okay, I’m gonna try my collarbone because
I don’t think my lid is a fair statement. We’ll put a bit on Grandma’s cheek.
Right over Grandma. Okay, ready for this one?
What does it look like? It looks kinda cool. It kinda looks like iridescent, not super strong. I don’t really see it on the monitor. How is it in person, though? Let me look.  It was a little powdery, just being dead honest,
 like you could see flecks of like actual powder. It’s not like melting into your skin. If you get what I’m saying? Like can you
see like, you look like you’re dry almost. Oh great. Um… I’m not feeling this, Jeffree. It’s not duo chrome to me. No, this looks like white powder on me. Okay. In my opinion, maybe pink powder. I don’t know, it looks like powder,
not a highlighter. I’m not living for this. No. You know I love BECCA, I love the packaging, Totally,
and have lived for their highlighters for a long time. Agreed. Completely. And it’s very shifting, I wouldn’t say
duo chrome, that’s a reach right there. We are reaching. Um, okay. Alright, let’s do our final thoughts. Listen, we had five crazy moments here. I’m gonna say it for us. Burberry is the win. Yes, easily, easily.
It was the win. Now, the two that were like mediocre. So these ones weren’t horrible, but they weren’t
the best on earth, but they were pretty good. Yeah, I like ‘em.
I mean they were they were blinding. They were cool. This one though, sheer my ass. No. The description is completely wrong on that, friend. It was. But it was the first highlighter that I’ve ever used
 wet that was less blinding. Less pigmented. Yeah, less pigmented than the dry. Yeah, I agree.
Which is weird. Now the ones that fell a little flat.
 I mean, La Mer, I fucking live for you, but $130 for this?Girl, at that price, you got a lot to
own up to at that price and it just didn’t do it for me. It didn’t do it for me at all. So, this one, sadly, love the packaging, formula… And then… We had the BECCA Prismatic.  And I just felt like, especially for my skin
tone it looked like pink powder on my face. Yes. I’m not living for it. My collar bone kinda flopped. I live for the
 uni-carton, like I love the packaging. Yeah, I mean the packaging suck. But the powder, was not living for it. No. I feel like the other formulas are more creamy. Yeah, and that was very just like loose powder.
Like Opal and Moonstone is like…Yeah, for sure. Like butter.
For sure. So, I don’t know what happened here. Not living for it, but I can’t wait
 to see what they put out next. Yes. But yeah, so, Burberry won, you guys. Yay.
Yay. Now, the beauty world keeps putting
 out so many crazy highlighters,  like, I feel like every few weeks
there’s like something coming up. Agreed. So, those are the most expensive ones
that I could find for this timeframe and I’m sure there’ll be a lot more coming. So, if you guys like us testing

hello everybody welcome back to my channel today oh my god today what the hell are we gonna do today you guys ok so the other day I got the new iPhone X are we calling it the X the iPhone 10 I gotta say one thing it is so weird not having a button like I am so used to the fingerprint my brain is just like not having it basically when you live your life online and you take pictures all day you want the best camera so of course I had to get it when I saw the camera quality I was like girl you better swipe right on snapchat once and get that beautiful filter because my pores are gonna be even more accentuated okay there's been a lot of stuff going around about the face ID now I know a lot of you are probably wondering Jeffery where the hell have you been it's been a week without uploading I had another root canal I've been under the weather I have been really working hard on next year's collections for my brand I'm wrapping up holiday there's been so much going on but basically you guys I had a root canal the other day it was deadly I have been in so much pain I'm good now your girl's back but when you're on codeine you can't help with video but we are here so I was gonna film a video as soon as I got this in the mail to see if if I put on a full face of makeup will the phone recognizing me but sister James Charles already proved that it will work so I said you know what let me try a face mask some wigs some contacts and see if it will let me into my own phone so I'm seeing a lot of videos of the face ID right a lot of people aren't showing you how to set it up so if you do not have this phone or you've never seen it I do want to walk you through how the iPhone records your face it's very easy it's very quick so we're gonna show that process and then I'm going to put on a new pink mask a wig some contacts some lipstick and let's see if I can break into my own iPhone so we are going to log in here now it says face ID and pass code we're going to click that it wants me to of course enter my passcode which I will be doing right now so now that we are in I'm going to actually turn around this is the first time I'm turning around on my channel this feels really weird so as you see it says where's the face ID setup face ID BAM it's just that easy let's click it and now is how to set up face ID first position your face in the camera frame then move your head in a circle to show all angles of your face so it's kind of like the fingerprint we all most of us know you put your fingerprint on the iPhone you move it around ever kind of like records your fingerprint and then voila you want in BAM alright so let's get started oh-ho there I am oh my god that lighting is this shit's you guys position your face within the frame move iPhone a little lower I think the lighting because of my beauty lights is not letting me you guys let me try oh my god I think it's too backlit pulling you guys I'm moving over here moving over here oh wait here we go here we go here we go move your head slowly to complete the circle first face ID skin complete holy okay so continue move your head slowly to complete the circle looking about the  chiropractor there we go face ID is now set up done okay so now we are an you guys so basically when you want to first of all go out of an app you just swipe up there right so I want to click the side of my phone we are now of course dark so let's click the phone BAM okay oh hi Nate now you're gonna swipe up so it's basically waiting to do face ID okay so of course there was no face in front of it it went dark let's click it again face ID we're in the phone BAM okay so now we know it has my face recorded first of all when it's backlit don't try that at home because that was difficult okay so now that Apple knows who I am so now we are going to do a little God my hair is up you guys when you wear a wig every day or you just have your hair in a bun this is what happens okay so we are going to take the new Boscia pink aluminized mask and we're gonna put it all over our entire face now this is a math that you peel off I know a lot of you have seen the ones that are for I think it's actually the same one the one that is like pure black that one is the same thing this is just a new shade so this is the pink version this has pine bark extract in it vitamin C we're supposed to promote skin elasticity we're supposed to brighten and we're supposed to reduce the look of fine I'm always going to do that who isn't okay so we're gonna put this on and then we're going to put in some contacts and then we're gonna try a wig and then we're gonna see if she recognizes me all right let's get started so with this mask we're gonna apply a thick opaque even layer to clean dry skin avoid eye area eyebrows hairline and lips well thank God I don't have any brows and then we're gonna wait 30 minutes and then peel off all right now I have never used this one before I know this just came out and I've been dying to try this now quick tea I was actually gonna put out a pink face mask but a lot of brands have beat me to it doesn't mean I won't in the future you never know oh is bubble gum shade I'm living mmm same fresh smell as the black one now let's apply this baby [Music] all right now that it looks like my face is melted plastic this is such a cool shade of pink it literally matches this mirror looks like I like melted this down and then drizzled it all over my face or it looks like strawberry come yeah strawberry come all right first of all these mirrors early December there's the tea okay anyway back to the video all right so we're going to let this dry this does take a minute to dry I love this look all right now we are also going to take some contact lenses from des Co the ones that make my eyes look very ice white and we're gonna pop those bitches in right now right there baby les roll BAM I did get a little bit of mask on my finger sorry about that look at me trying to blow in the damn mask oh so there is a difference between one eye and the other let's get the other one in alright the contexts are in my hair is getting masked ow oh my god okay so this mask does take 30

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel hi good morning today we are here in New York City at the Four Seasons and girl yes I'm traveling again my last video I was in Vegas since that video I've been in Michigan been working on my house and just been traveling up a storm so I told myself girl the jet lag may be creeping in but we have so much makeup to play with so I thought I would just sit down in my room before I did some meetings later today I'm actually flying back home the next day so when this video goes live I'll be in California for a few more days and then we are off to Bologna Italy for the Cosmo Prof makeup convention so yeah I brought a lot of makeup with me on this trip we are here doing some stuff I was lipstick Nick's surprise guest model for her makeup les here in New York City that was so fun and now we are here doing some stuff with balm on the fashion house extravaganza but I brought all this new stuff there are stuff here that is about to launch like the Bret men palette we have new Mac Jeremy Scott that just launched we have new primers concealers setting powders lip glosses we have everything here today so before we dive into the makeup I quickly want to announce something I am having a huge restock on jeffree star cosmetics calm on March 10th I will finally have the black star handheld mirror available on my site I will be restocking

like this so we got windbreakers the mirrors the makeup bags and a whole lot of goodness coming so saddle up for March 10th now let's dive into today's full face video all right so of course we got to get this skin moisturized and snatch so I looked in my boxes before I left here I got a lot of packages before this trip so I'm like okay let's bring everything new from the brand glow recipe we have the new watermelon glow pink juice moisturizer this retails for $39 and it says it's really good for oily to combo skin reading on the here it says after cleansing and toning dispense a dime sized amount Pat gently onto skin until completely absorbed works well under makeup oh okay but also has soothing botanicals and it's gonna prep my skin for the day ahead now I love this bottle look at how cute this looks so let's just give her a whirl oh it's like a um like a wand almost oh my god it smells like watermelon starburst I'm deceased and I'm just gonna take it with my Beauty Blender and let's see what happens okay now I have been on about five airplanes in the last three weeks so I actually have a pimple for the first time in a minute you guys isn't that exciting just kidding we're gonna cover it fully today hopefully with some full coverage foundation this feels alright doesn't feel very hydrating like I'm not sure how hydrating it's supposed to feel it feels alright so let's see how they make it goes on of course we have a brand new primer this packaging is turning me on this is the new tatcha the silk canvas it looks like a big compact it actually screws off like this and the there is the product so this is allegedly a velvety priming bomb a press silk that smooths and makes makeup last longer while keeping the makeup out of the skin helping to prevent clogged pores and breakouts yay okay so this is a solution for pores oiliness dullness and uneven texture I'm not sure how to apply this I think common sense says just touch it okay it's on my hands let's see what happens here oh wow go like glides on I thought it was gonna be like tacky but it's like no it's gliding so I'm just gonna smooth this on and let's see what happens alright that went on really good and it actually kind of blurred my pores here they usually are a little more prominent and they are not alright I'm really excited for the next product it is a brand new foundation that just hit the market a month or two ago I haven't had the chance to use it yet so I'm really excited last year is your way cosmetics was the brand that I collabed with and we did in this amazing lip topper actually the only company that I have a code whip and it's for charity so we'll dive into that in a second but I've been dying to try this out this is the G way essential high coverage cream foundation it looks like this I have two colors here with me today I think I'm gonna be sand shell looks a little too dark for me this foundation also has a brush that you can buy with it it looks like this it is like one of those paddle brushes but the shape is more unique it has a little diamond cut right here I'm sure it's for getting into the crevices of the face so this is a supreme coverage lightweight and long wearing foundation it creates impeccable airbrush matte finish instantly you only need a small amount it is a concentrated formula and it is very full coverage it has chamomile and cucumber extract hyaluronic acid oh my god it's matte it's oil free there's no gluten it's vegan well hot damn chewy so this does retail for $38 alright I'm not really sure the undertones of this I just grabbed a few I may have myself over we'll see if this is to yell over me I am just going to take a little drop here on the brush itself let's just go in here do you guys see that that is not a lot at all let's see what happens oh that is not my color alright you guys I put a drop of shell in here this may be way too much foundation and this is not my color you guys can read me to filth but here we are and remember we are filming in a hotel with no beauty lights aah whoa holy Shh all right so here's the difference of just a little bit here versus this how are we feeling it feels like there's nothing on my skin which is a very bizarre and why do I feel like the other color matched me better even though it looked a little darker all right it's maybe too much I'm just gonna put a little on I don't want to get foundation in my hair so we're just gonna tuck this back for a second and yes this is a little dark for me but hey I don't mind it I'm like first impressions while we're just sitting here talking look at that look at the coverage that one drop is like covering my entire forehead imagine if we did a second layer you would be like ready to go swimming and just be set for life all right you guys to shade may be a little dark for me don't mind it but the coverage is everything I need looking up close the primer and foundation did go nice together okay cool you guys so let's move on I'm really excited for this next concealer it's so literally six dollars and it's from the brand a makeup revolution this is the new conceal and define full coverage concealer now what is it supposed to do let me tell you this concealer you guys literally is supposed to be full coverage it has 18 shades has cool neutral and warm undertones it's supposed to be lightweight yet full coverage it's gonna cover blemishes even skin tones counteract dark circles it's supposed to cover your bad mood if you're in one all right I mean it's concealer you guys we know what we're doing here so I'm just gonna go with the shade see one it should be the lightest and that's what I need I love a very bright face so it could be too bright though you never know let's just do a little dot whoo I'm just curious what c3 looks like c2 was a little too yellow for me so let's just add it in there for fun oh it's darker okay c1 it is baby this is just a full face full coverage moment today as you guys can see this is blending out really pretty very brightening and blend it out in about five seconds so I love it I put some concealer a few more spots over here you guys know I move a full queen like we want so much concealer we can't even see our feelings so now we're just gonna buff and blend so we added a little bit more under here it is full coverage but not like full full like the bottle said or maybe I'm just a crazy bitch in like dad more so I did a little second layer under the eyes and I really loved it it blended up beautifully it's creamy there's no creasing it looks stunning and definitely brightened up my face now we're just doing the center of the forehead like lipstick Nick likes to say this is concealer in the middle here just kind of creating a little light burst on your forehead now we got to set everything and I'm so excited to try this in Beauty bakery flower it is a setting powder come on packaging a plus I love that so this says for a natural-looking baked beet try our lightweight matte flower setting powder great for setting makeup or baking of course it says use a brush you can lightly dust your entire face you can use a makeup sponge you guys know I love using the sponge so let's open her up and see what it looks like here is what the packaging looks like now this brand is from California shout out to them hey they're in San Diego and they actually have a store in the mall which i think is so cool for any brand already have a store we're gonna open it up and it looks like this this is shade translucent so let's take some of the powder let's put it on here and by the way I'm looking in this mirror and I'm like for a seven dollar concealer this  is bomb okay let's take our sponge and we have of course our flower setting powder in here I'm just gonna coat my entire Beauty sponge let's see what happens [Music] all right anywhere where we put concealer we're gonna put some on there I'm gonna take a little bit more now we're just gonna let this sit for a minute we're gonna take a hit and we'll be right back all right now we're going to take a little NARS brush and dust off I also forgot to mention that this retails for $24 you can buy it on their website it is oh it's out of stock girl you better restock this damn also this formula is vegan and it is very long wear so let's take this little brush and let's wipe [Music] oh my undereyes look like I am 16 again honey it's impressing me it's hard to impress this bitch and when I see something up close like this with natural daylight and I'm like it looks this pretty damn bitch I feel like I'm set and ready to conquer the world just to set the rest of my face I am going to use the Beauty bakery flower and some Chanel powder I didn't have any new face powder so we're just gonna mix and dust this all over and then we will start with contour and highlighting I'm really excited to try the new Mac Jeremy Scott this is a little cheek x 3 acoustica contour blush highlight little palette now the packaging I'm deceased we pull it out it looks like this a little holographic moment it has the iridescent powder it has a bronzing powder and as a powder blush let's open it up so as you see it looks like this and then you pull it off I love the handwriting like it's a little mixtape so adorable so once you take it off the shades

know me I'm down for anything let's dive in there a little bit more and let's see how we go look it's gonna cut my cheekbones out a little bit okay yeah it's a little warm but I actually don't mind it it is going really nice with the under eye so ok cheekbones how are you now we're gonna take a little bit and go on the forehead now this is pigmented I am dusting off because I don't want to look like a stripe crazy person but yeah it's a very pigmented now there is this picture frame on my wall over here you guys in the room and I know the lights are crazy but am i high or is there like this weird white cat right here I don't know why because the foundation was consistent powder everything this side doesn't look like that so my lighting is a little crazy you guys know so sorry about that but so far so good I was actually worried this would be really Orange on me but I like it it's pretty alright you guys now we're about to dive into the new Breton rock morphe brushes collaboration this drops on March 13th thank you guys for sending to me early I cannot wait to dive into this so this has six shades by the way morphine never has packaging like this so Brett man you did that girl now when you open it up you get six shades you of course get one for every skin tone which I love it's a very versatile also if you guys didn't know you can use highlighters for your eyes for shadows your body anything I did do two finger swatches on snapchat the other day I know most of you saw that so that's where there's two finger marks in these two shades now this does it retail for $29 and yeah this is probably gonna sell out very quickly it looks stunning when I did the little finger swatches they were blinding so now let's see how it works on my face I think we're gonna use a baby girl and vacation these two right here and let's see what happens now the palette in the pr box came with a brush so i'm not sure if this comes with the palette you probably have to buy it separate let's find out while I'm opening this so what it says that the palette comes with this brush so that is a very good deal for $29 so let's dive into vacation it looks like a beautiful champagne gold color does it work were we about to find out oh okay it's like that wet highlight look okay very pretty you know it's crazy about New York when I go outside and I walk around no one's really wearing my lighter so what was watching this from the city where do we go to see some highlight action because honey it's not happening in New York right now I almost want to add this on top of it baby girl cuz it just looks so cool let me grab the morphe 510 brush and we're just gonna hit that right there and let's just put that high up here oh wow are y'all seeing what I'm seeing because these two

give me a little blush I'm so excited to dive through the eyes my lids are already primed and ready with the Mac painterly paint-pot now let's get into some fun shadows I have been dying to play with these ever since I saw them on trying to move so Miss Pat McGrath has new pallets out and she has three of them now we all know I've tried and used the other ones oh the formulas phenomenal so these pallets there are six shades of course in each with matte and metallic beautiful formulas I think we will see if the formula is consistent to the last palette so there's this one and this one is called the mothership subversive the Olevia narrows we have the mothership subliminal platinum bronze palette oh wow these colors will look amazing very different than the ones we just saw and then there is another one oh my god the packaging on this look at that the lips the B in the mouth I'm done and then this one has beautiful warm tones full bronze palette I love that I think that I have definitely done enough bronze looks on my channel so the subversive palette is calling my name now I like this because you're probably wondering where are the shade names it does come with this little moment so you can put it back on for protection when you're ready to roll or you can just keep it in your makeup drawer but I love this and also the shade names are on the back the shade purple rain' that's calling my name right now so I was really inspired by something on Pat McGrath's Instagram now they used the palette for this look this looks so stunning very runway and high fashion I'm like okay this is something I don't normally do I myself so I'm going to give it a little bit of a Jeffrey twist but I love the purple and Pink's together and there's also a new eyeliner which I have with me by the way hi hello packaging goals love this holographic blue there's also a perma precision liquid eyeliner which I will open up in a second and we will paint on some lashes we'll do some liner and we'll see if the formula for this is good let's dive into the palette so we're gonna dive in first to this pink shade we're in New York City let's go bold and this shade is called the rose or risque now I know a lot of your gonna be asking me what are the price for these palettes these are 55 dollar retail which i think is really great because we all know her other palettes are 125 so if you're someone that has been on the fence or you've been dying a trimer formula out these are good options looking at that video they have the pink right in the front of the eye which is so cool and different so good news is I have no eyebrows so we're just gonna take this and we're just gonna apply some pink oh hello barely touching my skin how little pigmentation we're just gonna buff that right or the brow bone would go and we're just gonna stop it like the Veda and just give it a little like burst of pink right here alright now the model has a very different eye space than me her lids are very different so I'm just kind of tailoring it to what I would do and bringing the pink up a little more since I do have no brows I know it's gonna be look a little weird at first but you know it all is gonna come together so now that that pink is lay down this side we're just gonna mimic it on this side alright so now I'm going to take purple rain' and we're just gonna use this brush to carve out that line that this model has on her wow this is saturating the brush who let me to put too much on it alright so I'm just gonna kind of follow my line here they're my deep-set eyes go just to kind of give the illusion now the model here had way different eye shape doesn't mean we can't do it it just means we have to tailor to our eye so we're just gonna take this and we are gonna blend it out a little more i screenshot it I'm looking alright now I'm gonna take this little Bobby Brown blending brush and we're gonna go into Purple Rain a little bit but we're just gonna softly take it and just kind of blend up so I know the line is a little more harsh on the picture we're gonna do a little bit of my spin to it and I'm just going to take that and just drag up a tiny bit just so there's a little dimension I am not used to harsh lines on my face but I'm kind of living so now there are this I mean there's so many shades and all of these palettes but what's really gravitating me is this one over here called gold nectar now I know the picture I was inspired from did not have the gold in it but we're gonna add some maybe on the entire lid and just take it there because that's what we're here for so I'm gonna take a little flat synthetic brush and we don't even need to wet this with Pat McGrath like you guys know that so I'm just gonna take a little bit and let's Pat it on the lid oh wow I'm like good morning so I'm actually gonna keep a space in between the purple and just put this gold all over my lid Wow usually have to wet a brush to get this effect but this is like happening instantly wow I love this gold tone because it's very unique I don't really have this color and a lot of my palettes it's usually just like a bright gold or like that full yellow gold so I love this tone all right you guys I'm looking like a cyborg alien right now this is so different than what I normally would do on myself but I'm kind of living so now we're going to dive into this shade right here it's called pale fire it's like a beautiful quarrel here we'll just touch it real quickly oh wow this looks in sane look at that undertone oh honey it's like peach duochrome pink now I'm just gonna take some under my eye with a little brush you can pack this color all over your lid for a full moment but we're just gonna do just a little subtlety today it's gonna take that and lightly drag it under my eye oh wow so I'm just lightly putting this right in the front it's more of a subtle shade so I'm barely touching my lid if you want more coverage you can wet your brush or use a flatter one I just want this to be a little accent right yes I'm just looking like a full alien glam today now I'm just lightly packing this under my entire under eyes and then we're gonna move on to the liner I'm quickly gonna take this shade baby girl from the Brackman highlighting palette and we're just going to blend that up into the pink just so it's full-on alien and you know it needs to let its full moment I'm really excited to try out the new Pat McGrath eyeliner you guys when I saw this packaging I was like so let's pop this open in a second after I'm done blending my life away all right so let's cut this open and see what this perma precision liquid liner looks like of Cole of course of course I'm cool so nice little scissors to open this baby up and let's see what is inside BAM ooh okay so here is the liner now this is we're just gonna pop it open right now oh wow okay so there's the applicator it looks something like this very thin and great and let's just do a little line in our hand for fun Oh like literally they went on with perfection look at that like oh hi okay hello you have to shake it no we don't even have to shake it oh my god okay so allegedly this formulation is sensual its saturated supposed to glide across the lid with an obsidian velvet matte finish sigh meeow this soft flexi art tip offers control for elegant contours and pristine definition okay well I cannot wait to see how this works let's just go in and let's do a light wing here and let's see how this works oh wow this is going on so easy now you guys know the Tom Ford eyeliner has been one of my favorites but this is to give it its run for its money because first of all I don't even have to shake this it's just going on with ease and it's not like skipping and it's not cheering out at all I hate when you go to do a wing or a line and then the pen kind of goes thin this is literally not doing that I'm kind of shocked okay like look how easy this is and I'm just gonna bring this past that purple and wow I don't know I've ever done a line or a wing or this quick before thanks Pat I think I may have found my new favorite eyeliner or mascara we're gonna use something overseas that I've never used before by the brand iconic London and this is their new boom mascara it retails for $30 on my god damn that's a little pricey so let's see what it's all about here oh wow look at this little wand that is very unique you can tell it's a little more smaller than we're used to seeing on this channel so let's go in and see what happens coating them very quick and easy so of course I had no idea what to expect this definitely coats the lashes very thoroughly it didn't make them really huge and volumizing I think it does the job if you're gonna wear false lashes it doesn't really matter anyway because you're just gonna cover it up but if you do love to wear mascara by itself this could be cute I'm not sure but for now it's definitely coating them they look cute and no complaints all right let's do the bottoms real quickly let's see what happens here now I like that the wand is a little small than normal only because the bottoms are gonna be easier to do oh wow okay it's definitely working I just don't want it too clumpy so I'm trying to take some of the product off of the wand yeah if you want thick dramatic lashes definitely this is good this reminds me of the benefit BADgal the way it applies on the bottom look out all right mascara is done not bad you guys I will say that mascara did the job our I think the only thing left we need is a little bit of a lipstick and then we're done so I reviewed these on my channel but they just launched six new shades this is the CIT London and glitter flip which took the internet by storm last year they just released a bunch of new colors and this one is called undressed if you've never seen this you gotta go check out my video or you'll see it right now but basically this is a hybrid of a liquid lip that when you go like this the glitter activates and it kind of comes to the roof so let's see what happens here oh wow it's so funny cuz last time I thought they were definitely missing a nude for this collection so I'm glad they made more colors I'm gonna let this dry and let's see if the glitter activates alright now that it's dry and let's see what happens oh wow now because it is a nude the glitter maybe a little more sheer on camera let me know what you guys think I'm gonna take my flashlight so you can receive the realty hmm oh that is pretty when the light hits it girl mm-hmm I'm gonna Bremen highlight baby alright you guys I don't have any new setting sprays I still have my travel little Mario facial spray with a little chamomile and lavender and as you can see it's more than halfway gone whenever when I really like something I bring it with me and I use it a lot so let's just give us a little spray all right well I'm naked so let me go let my hair down and get dressed and I will be right back alright I forgot I definitely wanted to try this gloss so before we even get our final thoughts Lancome put out this new glass called the rosy plum it's basically a plumping cooling effect lip gloss and I love a juicy lip so why not try it now oh the component is cute hmm like a light creme brulee vanilla II type of flavor that one on smooth and there was no color transfer cuz the lipsticks matte amazing cool we'll see what happens while we're doing the outro but okay guys so my bed is a mess there is makeup everywhere let's go through the face and see what worked what didn't work for an hour and a half M let's go over what flopped and what didn't so the glow recipe watermelon glow pink juice moisturizer I didn't think it like blew me away and my skin doesn't feel that like Oh so after I used it I'm like okay it's there did the job maybe I need to use a little more next time not sure but this didn't Wow me right off the bat I will use it in the future and let you guys know primer wears the primer touch now here's the deal this worked great for me my pores were blurred I think the foundation was so full coverage I couldn't tell that huge of a difference but looking at my skin sometimes you guys let's remember this that when you mix products sometimes you're not going get the result you love so if you combine this this and this is it gonna give you the same effect if I use lemare instead of this or you know you guys get where I'm staying here so when I'm looking at my face with foundation was full coverage it covered everything dark circles hyperpigmentation like all the little things that you guys tell me I don't have that I secretly see besides that my only complaint is that it's settled in these fine lines that I really didn't know I had it's a little right here crazy it's cracking a little bit and my fine lines are a little bit more prominent so I don't know what caused that I will definitely have to use each product separate in the future and just on my own spare time to get the real T but overall foundation coverage color formula is bomb oh my god the concealer that was a big moment for me the concealer and the highlighting palette those worked right off the bat like for seven dollars I'm deceased with this one like it really worked it looked beautiful and I can't wait to use it again so if you guys can grab these I know they're selling out everywhere give them a whirl the Breton palette of course this launches soon I love it I think it's beautiful PSD from Washington's Bremen congratulations I'm moving on oh the little contour moment I was shocked and scared it was gonna be a little too orange for me but it pulled off so if you're someone that wants to go like be on the go and you're just like all over the place highlight bronzer and blush in one this is for you the blush blush is really cute and easy I mean I don't really think I've ever had a bad experience with blushes on my channel this one is very soft and airy enjoy wait did that I'm moving on to the eyes I mean come on you guys these are everything the pigmentation is stunning they go on great packaging is a ten out of ten and I love everything about the mother ship palettes like I don't have anything bad to say about them they're just like oh hi they work and they do exactly what they're supposed to do now moving on Oh another Pat McGrath item is look at the sea of makeup here is the eye liner and loved it it was it says it's precision it worked great so I'm definitely gonna be keeping this handy it's a very lightweight and perfect for travel next is mascara I like the mascara I'm trying out a lot lately and it did the job if you're someone that doesn't love really dramatic bottom lashes you may not like this but if you're someone that doesn't even like falsies and you just want to do this perfect but besides that you guys the lipstick was great you know I love a ciate moment and it's gloss it does feel cooling now that I've been running my mouth but it doesn't like burn or tingle like other lip plumpers so like did it plumb besides that what am I missing I know I'm missing something there's a lot here this brush work oh my god duh deciding powder this was really great it didn't dry out my under eyes it didn't make me look cakey I actually really loved the combo of that concealer in this so we'll be trying her out definitely a lot more look at that your highlight though it alright you guys we are about to go ahead into the city and enjoy our last night in New York City thank you so much for watching today's video and of course I want to know what did you love but what did you hate about everything that I tried today sound off below and give me your final thoughts yourself are you guys I will see you on the next video mwah 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I'm not at home I am at the four seasons in New York City and last night was the Fenty Beauty launch with Rihanna of course you all know by now that she just released her makeup line it is making headlines all over the internet and today we are going to dive into all the products now the launch party was lit it was an amazing experience to just see the beauty community come together for such a monumental moment so in today's video I have all the products here that Rihanna launched from foundations to brushes to highlighters to cream contour sticks to everything we got lip gloss we got sponges we got invisible blotting powder there's a lot here so if you want to see some swatches I'm gonna apply it to my face we're just gonna have a little playdate in bed today now if you saw my snapchat you know you got a little spoiler the highlighters I'm just gonna say it now fucking bomb now I have not tried anything else so the highlighters are pretty good of course we're gonna apply them to my skin we have sticks and powders so also I just want to give you guys a quick little tea that I am in a hotel room so the lighting and sound is gonna be a little different then if I am at home in my studio so if the light fluctuates we are literally using daylight behind us and there's like 10 skyscrapers and the Sun keeps going in out of the clouds so if it looks a little off I apologize bear with me alright you guys let's jump right into the video all right you guys let's dive into the products I'm sure a lot of you have been dying to see them in action as well as me I went to bed last night and I woke up just thinking about makeup and I couldn't wait to play by now most of you know that rihanna launched Fenty beauty it is a Sephora exclusive and they did a huge launch where they think they launched in like 17 countries last night it's on their own website it's on Sephora it is everywhere and if you're in Europe it is available at Harvey Nichols I believe now there's a lot of products here so I was like damn girl I love that she didn't just come out with like one thing she's like BAM and I think something that was really cool and important to note is that her brand is very inclusive and she spent a lot of time working on this and the foundations you guys there are 40 shades with I think even more come and I think that is so epic because a lot of the times y'all know brands release foundations and there's like ten shades and you're like girl so the fact that she spent a lot of time perfecting the formulas and creating a really cool shade range I think is really awesome so today we're gonna start and do every park that I have laid out in front of me I do want to note that I do have all the prices here so I'm gonna go over everything with you guys and we're just gonna have a little playdate right now all right so let's get started so the first item is which is great a face primer so this right here you guys is the pro filter instant retouch primer now this is supposed to let's read it smooth pour diffusing finish with extended makeup wear girl you know I'm about that life that comes in this beautiful glass component with the nude on top and it also matches the foundation so here's what the foundation looks like now this does feel very nice and luxurious y'all know I am NOT about no lightweight packaging this feels heavy now in this bottle there is one point eight fluid ounces and that's a lot for a primer love it but let's see if it works that's the rotate here so here's what the primer looks like it is like a lotion like consistency and oh yeah it kind of feels like so we are going to just take some and apply it to the skin all right so the primer is on it feels nice it doesn't feel too tacky it feels kind of smooth and it does feel a little hydrating it's not like I didn't suck in my moisture which is nice all right now this primer does retail for $37 looks a little up there for a primer but if it works it works of course the foundation is kind of what I have been highly anticipating of putting on this is the soft matte long wear foundation it's called the pro filter as well and the box says medium to full coverage for all long wear light as air it did match my shade at the event there was a lot of crazy lights so hopefully I got a good match I have no idea what's about to happen here so besides the foundation which by the way retails for $34 there is also a beauty sponge and that is the precision makeup sponge it looks a like this it's flat on one side and around on the other with a flat tip now this is retailing for $16 and so for it says that this is a three sided makeup sponge designed without latex perfect for applying and blending all formulas use damp for buildable coverage or dry for full coverage of course we know that beauty blenders and other sponges do soak up a little bit of product I'm gonna use it damp because that's how I normally do it I want to feel comfortable so let's just take the foundation and let's put some on our hands well just do two little dollops and we'll see how it goes I don't know how quick it dries yet I don't know the coverage so let's give it a whirl all right so I'm just gonna blend out half of my face and let's see how it looks [Music] all right you guys the foundation is blending out beautifully I'm only gonna do one side of my face so you guys can see what is happening but I just put a little bit more under my eyes the sponge is blending it out pretty nice now this foundation does dry quick so I'm glad that I only did half of my face because sometimes all this dot all over and then it dries a little bit more over here so here's my face with half of the foundation and half without so for a little first impressions we're gonna zoom in a little bit and let's take a look at the skin now the foundation looks looks beautiful honestly like I'm looking at my skin like it is very smoothing I'm looking back like damn girls a little jacked up so far so good now I also forgot in this crazy goody bag so we got the products of course at the party and I was just looking to the bag and there's actually a brush that is also for applying so we got the sponges we got the brushes and this one is a full-bodied foundation brush which is full firm airbrushed full coverage so I thought why not try the brush for the other side of my face so here it looks like this it has a little guard of course with the logos on it it is a synthetic of course that's how we apply creams all right so let's just take the foundational width of the brush and let's see how it applies is it better than a sponge do we live oh wow [Music] alright now I'm going in on the neck to blend down of course and I will say this I live for this brush and how it applied it the sponge I thought worked great and then I tried this and I'm a little bit more in love I don't even know why I mean obviously it's the tool it just looks even more airbrushed on the side from the brush and it actually applied quicker and definitely gave me that full coverage moment maybe the damp sponge wasn't the best idea also when I put it on it did oxidize very slightly and I loved how it looks so that's not really a negative for me so just be mindful if you are buying your shade you might want to go a shape down if you are worried about you know shopping online because you can't touch or see it but of course these products are in store so if you are a little weird about a girl and go at the mall the foundation is dry and they were telling me at the event last night that the foundation kind of like sets itself so I'm feeling it and it doesn't feel tacky it feels really nice now you know you've been watching my channel for a while you know I love a full mask of powders after the foundation but I will say this I'm not mad at how my skin looks it looks the lawless and it looks very nice now they do have a belonging powder so maybe in a minute I'll put blotting powder under my eyes no I love the component for this one it's like this weird shaped little compact that opens up the back of this of course that has a little sponge with it and then of course the protector now this is a universal blotting powder this is $32 for the in division at blotting powder this says that it absorbs shine and diffuses the look of pores for an instant filtered look on the fly I'm gonna do that right now because my pores are annoying so I cleaned off the foundation brush and I'm just going to dip in here really quickly and I'm just gonna press it under my eyes and see how I feel about it all right you guys so it is giving a little bit of a blaring effect which you know I am all about I want to look as plastic and fake as possible okay cool well this will be interesting to see later if I have shine and I go in if it really does take it away but for now it's doing a little blurring effect and so far so good now we are going to dive into the matchsticks I know a lot of the online have been like what the hell are those I tweeted some pictures of them last night and here is what they look like so they are magnetized I love this packaging because it looks like a honeycomb and if you didn't know I got honeycomb and bees tattooed on me now there are two formulas there is a mat which is kind of like contour and highlighting sticks and then there's also the matchstick shimmers which are crazy highlighter colors we have golden and orange and purple and and the shade names were pretty cool so let's just try it as contour one and this one is called mocha now these matchstick matte skin sticks retail for $25 and let's see a magnetized makeup stick in a long wear light as air matte formula to conceal correct contour or touch-up in 20 shades so I guess we're just gonna give it a whirl I'm gonna contour with this a little bit now only thing is I don't have any powder contour from her brand to put over it so if it doesn't set itself and its tacky I will put a little bit of powder on top now this product also has 0.25 ounces in it I know a lot of you read me to filth when I reviewed a other contour stick every months ago and I did not show how much product was in there so let me put this all the way up here is what you get in this product I think that is a lot of product because it is more fat I'm just gonna say it because all of you are gonna read me I know they k'kaw contour sticks were a lot smaller with a lot less product and a lot of you had problems with them breaking off this one is more sturdy it feels more expensive and there is a lot more parked in here so I have no idea how this covered is gonna look I'm just gonna start here and do a little line in case it's intense BAM I'm just gonna go on this jaw line and go after looking in the bag I forgot there's actually a little brush that says contour and concealer brush which looks like this so I guess if it works it works now then first the bristles here feel a little bit hard they just don't feel as nice as the this brush or the highlighting brush so let's see if it wants to blend out all right I feel like the brush took a little extra work to really get it in there I would probably just go in with a sponge or a different tool that I already had just to make it quicker with the brush it's not I mean it worked right y'all see you on camera I'm just gonna buff it out with the sponge and give it a little bit more of like a airbrushed finish this brush actually worked a lot better than this little guy wasn't too big of a fan of this little brush but this way quicker so this is great for a little foundation the blotting powder I'm like using this for everything I must blend it out a lot easier I know I'm really liking it we are blended to filth and I apologize you guys for the lighting in today's video the litter like the Sun just disappeared behind some skyscrapers okay cool so before we dive into the powder highlights I know a lot of you are dying to see those in action there are of course the matchstick shimmer sticks now they're kind of funky and fun some of them of course are more neutral this one which I know Briana this wore for the cover of her Elle magazine shoot was this purple guy called a unicorn this shade called confetti lord help me it's so pretty I swatch this at the party and I was like girl now normally you guys when you take a cream product and you just drag it over your foundation it can lift a little bit so I am just going to put some on my hand and let it warm up a little bit and then if you guys are afraid of ruining your foundation or anything you can take your fingers and let's just let it warm up a little bit and we're just gonna literally take this and Pat it on your cheeks and this is a really cool tip that lipstick Nick taught me so we're just gonna go right in over that contour and it's okay if it's a little subtle at first you don't want to you know ruin your beautiful foundation so here is confetti on the cheeks I think it looks beautiful it's serving me that alien like sex goddess realness that I'm living for and I love how it has like a little bit of glitter like in it as well as like a high volume shine so I'm gonna do what I always do is take the light on my phone and let's see how this looks I know the Lighting's gonna be a little crazy but hear me out guys oh that is pretty stunning so of course we can layer them with powder but we'll try that in a minute I do want to do the I've been dying to try the unicorn one here we go this is full-on purple darker than confetti so there is a unicorn on my hand it is definitely a way brighter lilac purple and I'm just gonna take this stick and see how it looks if I just paint on let's just give it a try and then I'm gonna take the sponge that with the no product on the end and I'm just gonna kind of buff around it and let's see if it likes that or not now I love this one because it is definitely like more subdued and it's definitely ethereal giving you that little more subtlety vibe so if this is a little too crazy for you this song isn't definitely right up your alley alright so one of the colors that I think is so stunning is chili mango I was just testing on my hand and blending it out I think for any woman of color this is going to be a stunning cream blush with a little bit of shimmer in it I love this I would definitely even use this sounds like an eyeshadow base they were also talking about at the event how you can put them on your lips and do everything so these are very versatile which I love now there is a face highlighting brush this is the cheek hugging highlight brush for $32 now I use this at the event and I fell in love with it because it really placed the powder right on the cheeks let me show you if I can get this damn thing open now this is a weird shape for I brush I love it it's kind of giving me that 3d look and it has this thing almost like cut into it where it's gonna like definitely go right on the cheek and I tried this last night I live for I can't wait to try it again now let's move on to the powder highlights these are the kilowatt freestyle highlighters girl know you all know I'm obsessed with highlighting and these definitely do it justice I think the star of the show is trophy wife Rihanna wore this to the party last night I wore it all over my cheeks on snapchat it is beautiful so let's go in with trophy wife now these retail for $34 come on highlight of course this is high-end and this says it is a weightless long-wear cream to powder hybrid highlighter that comes solo or paired so they also do come in duo's with other shades and they look like this now let me demonstrate this for you guys and tell me what you think let's get this blank cheek ready alright so we're just gonna take the brush barely go in a lot of pigment goes on there so these are definitely all right let's give it a whirl once white people Rihanna ain't playing alright you guys so that was literally one two dips in the pan now I'm gonna go in a little bit more on the brow so we can really show off this color now it is packed with glitter and amazing pigment like when I tried B's I was like oh my god bitch now of course I gotta do the flashlight test but look how it looks on the actual face and cheeks it is unreal like whoa I'm obsessed okay I think I'm gonna need this the formula and every shade please and just because we're sitting here we got to do some of the chest and body open have this robe a little bit now if you are someone who likes to wear dresses or low-slung tops just look at my chest you guys Jesus it is so stunning I'm like definitely obsessed with this even the light what that cream is stunning but then you go over here and you're like holy shit alright also for fun we're gonna take the shade a metal moon it is a more icy straight up white kind of like duochrome highlighter and I'm gonna put that over this side just so you guys can see little versatility so let's just put this over it and see what happens [Music] now of course this is not show up as blinding as this one with the glitter in it this one does not really have that glitter payoff but it still has a beautiful icy duochrome moment and I live for it let's get the flashlights out one more damn time because you know I just got to see this in action yes now you do see the flakes of glitter when the light hits your cheeks it is a little more subtle than the other side but still beautiful so also I mentioned of course that these come in a duo type of formula so there are four other ones that have the split Pan's and they're just as blinding so if you really want your shade they got all the shades for you and they're all really pretty I'm like hi there look at my hand it's like a glittering mist alright you guys we are down to the final product I don't want to end alright so this is the Fanta beauty gloss balm Universal lip Luminizer alright so what is this supposed to do this is a gotta have it lip gloss with explosive shine that feels as good as it looks in one Universal Rose nude shade I love it so literally this shade is supposed to look good on any skin tone and anyone the stop everything give it to me gloss that delivers explosive shine in one perfect shade handpicked by Rihanna herself the Fanta glow we're talking the unicorn of nudes that looks good on everyone girl we're just gonna try it out right now so this one is it comes in this cool of course honeycomb type of moment and I like the wand on this because it is jumbo I love a product that has a big wand because it gets my big old mouth done quickly so let's give it a whirl [Music] there is the universal gloss with an O this is just daylight on my face right now and now here it is with of course the light with its gloss is really pretty definitely kind of like an everyday gloss is it imperative to own this gloss I don't think so there's definitely a lot of drugstore dupes for this one everything else I'm not sure about that but this one it's you know there's nothing special about it I think it's pretty but it's not necessary um all right you guys I think it's time to give my final thoughts so let's go down the line I gotta say Rihanna you fucking killed this makeup line the formulas are on point now that I expected anything less but you never know because there has been a lot of people lately that have been launching products and they're kind of subpar and it's just like oh I'm a celebrity let me slap my name on something and call it a day I see the vision of this brand the formula is great and I'm really happy how everything turned out so let's just go down the line the primer is the primer necessary I y'all know I have some of my favorite primers already that I film with all the time I probably won't be grabbing this a lot just because it says it's gonna blur my pores and do a bunch of stuff and I still kind of see my pores it wasn't the best primer on earth but the foundation girl if you want a good new foundation I swear to God I am obsessed with this one also Laura Lee has filmed with this today and her skin drop the mic bitch her skin looked flawless so we're both huge fans of this and I think that the formula is on point of course we are going to see how this wears throughout the day but we've been filming for about an hour now and my skin has not moved and here's the crazy thing I didn't set it really I did the blotting powder under but I didn't do a powder foundation over it and it like set itself and it still feels good it doesn't feel weird so bitch this is everything moving on contour sticks y'all know the half of the world is not even into cream contour or maybe most of the world we all love powders so I definitely think that I would just normally just do powder contour personally I'm sure Rihanna will be coming out with powder contours so I don't think those were really necessary but they did blend out great once I used this brush the brush that came with I did not like it all I felt like it was a little too rough and it didn't blend it out nicely it was like kind of too patchy and the brush is a little too bulky I almost wish that it was longer to give it a little bit more of a flare but this brush saved the day it killed it with the foundation the blotting powder and the contour so this brush is definitely gonna be staying in my kit now moving on to the match stick sugar sticks you know I love them I mean look at this cheek it looks like an alien sat on my face and then stood up and left it's lime and I love it all right besides that I'm holding trophy wife I can't let it go I feel like it's the only one on earth I just have to have it this was a star of the show for me the glitter the pigment it was unreal I think I'm gonna douse my entire body with this and just wear high heels later so besides that I'm a huge fan of these now of course we all saw the lighter one I think this one is a little bit better this one was still pretty but I like intense makeup I'm gonna tend to a bitch so this one was cute trophy wife is a little better the duo ones of course I have not tried on my skin yet we will try those in later videos but just from watching them on my hands on point you guys I'm looking around now besides that what else do we have of course we have the lip gloss which I don't think the lip gloss is that's the only thing that was kind of like and for me it's a gloss it didn't do anything mind-blowing but it still is pretty so if you want to grab it grab it alright you guys add so much fun playing with all the offending beauty products I'm just gonna say it right now the Fenty Beauty collection by Rihanna is Jeffrey star approved I am a little shook at how consistently great it is overall I was expecting a few products to be bangers and maybe a few misses cuz you never know you guys it's makeup not everyone can execute everything flawlessly but somehow Rihanna managed to really slay so congrats girl your makeup line is everything I cannot wait to see what you put out next alright you guys thank you so much for watching this review here from New York City I will see you guys back home and on the next video mwah bye guys 
[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I have a very special guest we have Shane Dawson in the building I have never felt uglier it looks like when you like get it online versus when it comes oh it's bad fuck listen okay so so I recently did Shane Dawson's podcast it was so much fun and I'm like okay who has glammed you and no one not God so I thought you know what we should give shame the jeffree star makeover we're going to give them our best products today no drugstore for you never all right so today we're gonna dive into a bunch of makeup and we're going to see how

with gold flakes in it real gold go home leave so what do you think I mean look at the packaging on both okay um I'm going to say this one's probably more expensive because when people get like too fancy to glittery and shit it's a this is probably cheaper I feel like this was probably like 80 bucks okay what about the gold 175 if that's it yeah you got three million now this guy is it comes to all the comparison this is $120 right okay we're gonna try to throw on you it's really good I look at it no we're doing the gold no do whatever you want okay wait so I have a question before I ever do anyone's makeup I always like this touch their skin with what kind of what kind of skin do you think you have normal oily fine fucking gross fucking crazy fucking dry like sometimes like my boyfriend will take off something and he'll rip it off and it looks like a ruffle chip would you eat it sometimes okay the gold one is really good for oily skin a little bit and we're going to edit it will this

crying yet what do we want to do this one is so pretty or this one what are you drawn to that is not one because I feel like we've already seen that we've seen her she's been done makeup is messy mm-hmm like it looks gross no I mean like it goes everywhere everywhere like you guys think this is probably so glamorous like this looks do not know you should do a video where you show that like what I'm going to pay off is I know it rain is a while have you ever put makeup on your penis like to be funny um only when I better close his eyes haha he's doing the thing when you do one eye you're peeking it from the other dogs right yeah I contour my shaft a lot if I did that it would disappear oh by kidding I'm going I'm sick wait we what do you catch mark when it's flopping or when it's hard when it's hard and then when it's so then when it goes back down right this looks really like whoa good give me that longer that we're in here not Walters big okay okay so I'm putting on this metallic

What's up everybody,
welcome back to my channel. Today, we are doing round two
of the highlighter battle. And what the hell does that mean?
Well, I'm sure you saw the title. And, by the way, look at me.
I look so matte, where is my glow you guys? I feel naked, and also, I'm wearing a bathrobe,
and I have no panties on. But anyway, today we are going to be
testing out two highlighters. One of them is a drugstore brand,
and the price is $4.99. And on the other side we have
a $70 highlighter from a luxury brand, and basically in today's video
we are going to put them to the test, we're going to battle them out, we're going to see which side
of the face glows the hardest. Now, I did do Round 1 before,
about four months ago. If you want a catch at that video,
it will be in the description box, of course. So, if you want to see a battle,
then keep on watching. Now, last year, one of my favorite
highlighters ever was from Wet'n'Wild, and they have something called
the "Mega Glow Highlighting Powder" and they put out
a few Gold shades last year. They were a huge hit, they were probably
one of my favorite highlighters of 2016. So, when I saw that they were launching
new shades the last few months, I was like, "Oh, okay girl,
I need those right this second." And then they had to go
and do crazy colors, so not just Gold. We get a beautiful kind
of like pinkish color. Of course, we haven't swatched these yet,
so I don't know what the real color is, but this shade is called
"The Sweetest Bling." Now, both of these highlighters
are Limited Edition, they are cruelty-free,
and they are only $4.99. The other shade is "Lilac to Reality",
that's a cute shade name. And it looks something like this.
They both have hearts in the center, and they look really cute. Now, you know when
you look at something, you can already tell
how they're pigmented? These look pigmented.
It has this weird kind of like frosty glow over it, and the heart in the middle is white, I'm sure you can swirl them
around and mix them. We are going to test those, of course,
and do swatches on my hand, and of course, on my face. Now, we are going to test them
against a new Chanel highlighter. This one is also Limited Edition, it comes in a compact with
a dark red top on it with the black logo. Now, this is called the "Camilla Day
Chanel Illuminating Powder". This retails for $70, girl. I'm like, "You better fucking..."
If this shit don’t work for this price point, we all know what happened
in the first battle, it was awful. So, today we are going to be
testing out this guy. Now, Channel does not play games,
so this brush comes off like this, and you get basically like a barrier
protecting the powder from your hand. So, this comes off like this,
and your hand, and then Voila. Ah, that flower though. That flower.
The powder looks so stunning. Now, this is more of a
Gold-Champaign color, of course these little ones
are a little more funky. So today, we are going to just see
which one is more blinding. I'm going to use them
on my brow bone, up here. Uh, who needs eyebrows, it's 2017. I'm also going to be doing my cupids bow,
and the cheeks. So, let's get started. So, before we dive
into these on my face, I'm going to read you a little
description on their website. You guys know I like to be thorough, and make sure that this does
exactly what it says. So, this says, "With the
same formula as our must have Mega Glow
Highlighting Powder, this duo-tone powder adds
a pop of dimension when used together. The silky smooth, highly pigmented
formula gives an all over glow when applied to the cheekbones,
the browbone, and cupid's bow.” Okay, amazing. Let's take out the color
"The Sweetest Bling". It looks something like this. It comes in a little compact that is clear on top,
which I like that you can see it. Now, I'm also going to do this
little finger swatched on my hand first to see the shade before
I kind of mix them together. So I'm just going to take my finger
on the metallic pink part, and go like that. Okay, so you can see how the pink
kind of went into the white because I touched it, and it feels really soft,
it feels very smooth. It doesn't have like a powdery feeling.
It feel like… oh sorry, I just saw my finger for the first time.
I'm like, "Woo, look at that." That is really blinding on my finger.
Let me take this on my hand right here. Oh wow. That is like
a beautiful pinky rose gold color. Oh my God. Okay, that is cute. Now, let's grab Lilac to Reality.
She looks something like this, and to me, this looks like
a purple duo chrome kind of shift. I'm going to take my other
clean finger here, and go in. Oh, wow. Woo, it's a little more
reflective than the other one. Definitely has like a blue undertone,
and we will swatch her right next to this. Bam. It's very like unicorn,
has that like mystical type of vibe. Now, the other one looks to be
a little more pigmented on my hand. This one, not that it's sheer,
but it does look a little less, um... see, it doesn't look less
blinding though on the monitor. I'm looking at the camera
and I'm like, okay. So, I think I'm going to
layer both of these and just try these on
this side of my face. So, my left will be
the drug store side, and then the right side
will be the luxury side. So, I'm going to take
the Morphy brush, and I’m just going to swirl this around
the heart and in the middle. One, two, three,
the brush is pretty coated. Now, let's go in. Oh, that is nice, you guys. Okay, hold on now,
let me get a mirror and look up close. Ouh. Ouh. I'm like,
that is really really pretty. I'm going to add a little bit more.
You guys know I like to cake on the highlight. Now, this Wet'n'Wild highlighter
it's really pretty. I didn't expect to like it
this quickly on my face but... And with that peachy blush though,
oh my God. Okay. I want to take
the Lilac to Reality. Same brush. Ouh, okay. Okay, okay. And I'm just going to put this over
on the high planes of my cheekbones. Oh wow, girl. Ouh, those mixed though. All right, so first impressions.
It is blending out really nice, it's effortless, it's like...
the brush is like, living for the powder. I'm like, "Oh my God".
Ouh. Oh, wow. That with this liner though, girl.
Don't try me. Bitch is shook right now.
She's feeling shooketh. Okay, now we're going
to hit our cupid's bow, and put a little bit
over the lip stick. And this is Sweetest Bling, again. Oh, wow. I think I'm going to do
the whole cupid's bow, because it's just going to look
a little weird if I don't. So let me just go in. Hmm. Ah, I love it. All right, now, let's take
another brush. Of course, I'm going to use
a little Anastasia A-23. This is very similar to this, it packs
on the highlighter amazing. Now, for the right side of my face, I am going to be trying out
the Chanel highlighter. Of course, it looks something like this. I am going to take a clean finger, and I'm going to swatch the middle of it. Oh my God, I hate touching, like... I hate ruining the pattern on like pans.
I like, this bothers me. But it looks like this, which is like
a very pretty blinding champaign-gold, and I will swatch it next to these. We'll put her right here. The tone is so different than these
other ones. Like, I live for it. As you can see, that one is just as blinding. It has tiny tiny little, not pieces of glitter, but like finely mild glitter in the formula. I can see it already on my beauty lights,
and it looks really pretty. I'm like "Damn." Let's get our engines ready, and may
the best highlighter win. Oh, wow. A lot came off the brush,
like immediately, and as you can see in the pan, it like shows the ridges of the brush
of where it went. So, let's give it a whirl. Ouh. Oh, wow. Okay. We're going to go in with a little
bit more, for her cheekbones. That looks almost wet on camera. I'm like, "Holy, fuck me". Okay, I'm just fenesting it into
my cheekbones now. All right, you guys. Let me go in
for a closer look. This one is just as blinding as the drug
store one, but very similar. It's not like any more blinding, I don't think. It's not like crazy. And I'm also going to take
a little bit and dust it down the center of my nose. I love a little blinding nose highlight. Okay, on the nose though,
it is like extremely blinding. Like, come on, outer space,
how are you? And then, I'm going to do
a little bit on my chin, because we're trying to
highlight for the cause. My whole face is glowing. I'm going to go downstairs,
and Nate is going to be like, "Oh my fucking hell have
you been doing up there?" I go in for like an hour.
Okay, I have to stop. But, let me zoom in on my face and take
a peek at what the hell is going on. Okay, now, this one is just as
blinding as the drug store one. Now, of course, this color
is a little more, you know, we're going to call it "Normal",
if you will, of course. I really love it, it does look
like it's wet on camera. It's pretty, it's not powdery at all,
it was really lightweight. It applied with ease. I'm kind of shocked right now, you guys. Like, both of them didn't suck. Hi. I wanted to do a little quick test on Nate
before I gave my real final thoughts, and make sure that these
were blinding enough. This one looks pretty What are we trying again out here? So these are drug store highlighters. Yeah, yeah, Wet'n'Wild. Yeah, live for this. This is on this side of my face,
and on my mouth. Yeah, it's really pretty. No,
I seen you, your lip was like... Blinding, uh? Glowing when I came into the room. Radioactive. So I’m just gonna try this Lilac one
on you to see if it's pretty or not. All right. Now, Nate has no makeup on. Oh, damn. I test a lot of my own highlighters
and stuff on Nate, just to see how they wear
throughout the day. So, he's used to being
the makeup guinea pig. That looks really cool. Okay, now we're going
to do these Chanel. Oh, look at how pretty that flower is. Yeah, I like it. I like the stamp. Looks like my hole. All right, now we're going
to try the Camelia De... What the fuck is this bullshit called? De Chanel powder Illuminatres. Girl, fuck me. That takes Spanish and French. Okay. Ouh. Work. It's crazy how this one
is not looking as like... Blinding, it's not like... Okay, there it goes. See, you need
to kind of layer for a second. Yeah. There we go. So, it took a few layers to get
Nate to get to blind, blind world. And it's just like, it's like almost
my skin tone. so it's like... Yeah it is. Look at... This is the same cheek. You literally don't even like see it,
it's just like shinny. I mean, it's definitely there. I think
they're both really pretty glowy. Definitely think... Do a little turn this way. Yeah, Wet'n'Wild one is like stunning.  I kind of want to take the... It's called The Sweetest Bling. The Sweetest Bling? I think it's such a cute name.  It's like a rose gold moment. I’m just gonna put it on top
and see what happens. Okay, cute. That is really nice. I want to take a look at it with the flash. A lot of the times you guys,
I’ll take my iPhone, A lot of the times you guys, I’ll take my iPhone,
turn on the flash, and then… turn this way. Oh. I mean, that shit is... Woah, it looks so stunning. And then let me see this
Chanel one on me. I'm more interested in my brow, boy, I'm sorry. Shit's glowing. All right, babe. Thanks for letting me make sure I knew
what the hell I was talking about. Of course, baby. All right, now I'm going to give
my real final thoughts. All right guys, I have the giggles. Whenever I'm thinking about Nate,
I get so giggly. I’m like… Okay, so my final thoughts on the $4.99
highlighters versus the $70 highlighter are: both of them got the job done. They were both very pretty,
they were glowy, they were stunning, they were… I mean, they applied amazing, they were not chalky,
they were not powdery. So, at the end of the... I will say this, the $4.99
highlighter just dropped; it looks good bitch. Okay, so I will say this. The Chanel and the Wet'n'Wild
are both Jeffree Star approved. Wouh. What does that mean? It means that, of course, a drug store product can be just
as good as a luxury brand. Now, I will say this. This Chanel one feels heavier,
it did come with a brush, it came with a protective piece,
it came in this beautiful compact, which you know, it costs
a little bit more money, I'm sure, to manufacture this one,
and it comes with a mirror. So you got the mirror,
you got the pretty pan, you get the full shebang, as I like to say. Now, the Wet'n'Wild one,
it did the job, it was amazing? Is the packaging as crazy
as the Chanel one? No. Now, at the end of the day when I leave my house
and someone compliments me on my highlighter, or they see this on my cheek, they don't even know what
this looked like at home, so, of course, if you don't care
about packaging, and you just care about something that works,
 that is affordable and amazing, the Wet'n'wild one was unreal,
and I highly suggest it. If you want to splurge a little bit, and try out something else
a little more crazy, of course, be my guest. But, I think they were both amazing, and I'm just really glad that, unlike the first battle,
this one had better results. Because last time, Lord, Jesus. Who won the battle? I think that it was a tie, they both won,
and they're both amazing so, sadly, there are no losers
or winners today. If you guys like these type of videos, let me know in the description
box down below, and I will be doing some more
battles for you guys. Thank you guys for watching,
and I'll see you on the next one. Mhaw! Bye, guys. 
What’s up everybody?
Welcome back to my channel. Today we are going to remove
all of this gorgeous makeup. Yes, we really are actually. Today we are testing out the new Urban Decay
brand new Meltdown Makeup Removers. There are three items
today that they put out. Now recently they have been
putting out so many products. So they put out a bunch of stuff that basically you
prep the skin and you take away all your makeup. So it’s basically a whole
onslaw of amazingness. If you’re someone who wears a lot of makeup
and you are a cake face, you are a mannequin, you are a beauty killer, you are
someone that just loves to paint, then you are definitely going
to wanna to watch this. And of course if you just wanna watch
it and you don’t even really like makeup and you wanna see this bitch remove all
of this, then you better continue watching. Alright guys, let’s jump right into it. So I’m going to put my hair
back before the show goes on. And earlier I filmed a look
on this crazy makeup, it was a full face first impression using
all products I’ve never used before. So watch out for that later
in the week and yeah. So I’m just gonna clip
my hair back right now. So I know I get asked all the time
“Oh my god, you have long nails. How do you take out your contacts?” I honestly just look up and bam. It’s just that easy guys. So basically we have
a dissolving spray. It has vitamin E in it, it’s oil free and it’s supposed to just dissolve
the makeup immediately. And then we have a cleansing
oil stick, oil to micro foam. It’s hydrating, it has root extract in it. Okay, honey. And then we have a lip oil stick
which has a vitamin E, it conditions and it is supposed to remove…
I’m wearing a liquid lip today. This is my own shade, it’s called Dreamhouse
and it is very pigmented, and it does not come off. So it will be interesting to see
how this works on it. And I guess this is supposed to just be like
applied to the mouth and then it melts. So let’s get to melting everybody. I think I wanna try this spray first. Maybe we’ll just try it all
at the damn same time. But let’s open this up. Now this says to just spray onto
a cotton ball and just wipe away. Okay. So it’s that easy, huh? Alright you guys, so the dissolving spray
and the oil stick both retail for $26 each. Now for makeup remover,
is that expensive? I don’t know. I use a lot
of like MAC wipes. I don’t really use anything that dissolves
except that Clinique Take The Day Off Balm, that one works amazing. Also the lip oil stick retails for $15. So is that a good deal?
I don’t know. Let’s see how well it works
and then we’ll talk about it. Ah! Look how cute this is. Oh my god, it’s like
literally like a lipstick. Oooh, but it’s like clear. Okay cool. I think… should we try the lip first? Let’s try it and then we’ll
melt off the rest of this face. So the lip you guys,
let’s read the instructions. It says to use apply all over
your lips and wipe off. Repeat. Lips will be clean, moisturized
and ready for another coat. Alright so… Bam! That’s it. It has a cute little applicator and it says we’re just supposed to apply
to the mouth and see what happens. So let’s see what happens. Mmm it’s nice. Okay, I’m just gonna wipe it on the bank of my
hand once to get it going, see what it looks like. Ooh it’s shiny. Okay let’s try it. Alright let’s coat the entire top lip. Alright you guys, I’m like…
should I wait a second? I’m just gonna feel it and
see if any comes off. Ah! Oh, Ooh, it dissolves! Look at that. Oh wow! It’s like gone you guys. Okay, I’m just gonna be like really fun
and dramatic and see if this comes off. Ooh, oh my god! It dissolved off like BAM! Holy shit! Okay just for a test to see how well the other
products work, I’m gonna keep myself looking like I just sucked a dick for like twenty hours and I just
really want some fucking dinner, dinner, dinner. And we’re gonna move on and
let me take off these lashes. Ooh! Alright now let’s take
this dissolving spray… Now do we need to shake this?
Let me see. Spray onto a cotton ball. I’m just honestly going to spray it
onto my face because I want to. You know it’s new when
nothing comes out. Woo! There we go! I’m like used to setting my face. This is going to be so weird. Wow! It is so shiny. You know I have a lot
of foundation on so… even on my neck. Okay. I am also going
to unbox the stick. It says apply directly to dry skin. You know we’ve already clearly missed that mark
already because I just sprayed my entire face. But it does look like this. Now my lids are not that coated. I might just take this
and put it right on my lid. Oh my god! I am shook. My eye makeup just melted off. Holy shit! Alright I’m just gonna take
this and wipe it under. I have this crazy yellow mascara
and I do not want it on anymore. I’m gonna wait two seconds
and let’s see what happens. I just kind of wanna
like wipe everywhere. Let me get my hair again out of my face. Okay so I’ve sprayed this on my face. It’s been about like 45 seconds, 60 seconds
and there’s no burning, there’s no tingling. I just feel like completely like normal. It just feels like… it doesn’t even
feel heavy, which is awesome. So I am going to just smear it around
and see what happens for a second. Ooh, oh my god! This spray or maybe it’s
the sticks smells so good. It’s like pears. Shut up and eat your pear! Oh my god! it smells so yummy. Okay, let’s see if this is gonna
dissolve my makeup off you guys. Wow! It’s like literally…
it’s melting off. Alright you guys,
I have a damp washcloth. So basically this spray says
apply to face and wipe away. And the other one says
to spray on a cotton ball. Well girl, I just wanna see
how well it worked. It is melting everything off. So let me just take this washcloth.
I’m about to ruin it. And… Huh! Oh my god! All my foundation's
gone, like literally… Woah! Look at that. Gone! Let’s do more on this side. Wow! Holy shit you guys! You know I had a lot of powder on
earlier, I had a lot of foundation and… Ah! it’s just coming right off. Oh wow! That is such a trip. And the fact that this formula has no
alcohol in it, which high anti-aging, you know I’m not about that alcohol life, It’s amazing. Like that’s so cool that they got a formula
that didn’t need to be harsh on the skin. Wow! Even the mascara
came off like fast. Oh my god! Okay. It said if your lips were stained or if there
was like any residue to go back over it. So I’m definitely gonna go in a
second time with the lip oil stick. So let’s do that. Mmm that’s good too. Now for the makeup underneath my eyes
usually I’ll do like a cotton ball or something. I’m just gonna do this right for a second. Maybe I’m the only one, but I kind
of like this look, like I don’t mind it. But of course this is a makeup remover
video, so I will play by the rules. And I’m just gonna take
a little bit of the oil stick, I’m just gonna put it
right in my waterline. Ah! This is the one that smells
like pears. It’s so yummy. It’s like… Mmm.
I’m like hungry now. Okay. So we’re gonna take a
clean cotton circle and just… Oh wow! A lot came off. Now let me wipe off the lip. Oh yeah look, there’s
more little pink stains. Okay wow! Now usually what I do, I’m gonna give
my skin a second and then feel it and tell you guys exactly
what’s going on. Let me reclip this hair. After I remove any liquid lip I always like
to exfoliate my mouth and rehydrate it. So if you guys don’t use a lip
scrub, I highly recommend it. It doesn’t have to be mine,
but mine are edible. They are infused with a vitamin E and
aloe vera, and they taste amazing. This is the spearmint flavor
and I’m just gonna take some… I like to just take with
my finger like so. Of course you should do it over the sink
and not your makeup station, but hey. And just exfoliate. Mmm. Oh my god, It just feels so good. And then if you’re really twisted, you lick your skin clean. Mmm. it’s kind of like a midnight snack. Alright you guys,
so my hands are clean. I got clean fingers and
I’m just gonna feel my skin. Wow! It feel soft. I was afraid it was gonna feel
like really stripped or dry. You know sometimes I have to use makeup
wipes or remover it’s like “Oh help me!” but my skin feels good. I mean obviously I love to moisturize
after and I love to tone. But overall it feels amazing and now just because I wanna get all the makeup
off I’m gonna go in with my favorite toner by Sicily. This is the Floral Toning Lotion. It has been in my favorites video before. Oh my god! I mean, you know,
I’ve loved Urban Decay for a long time. So whenever there’s a new product out on the market,
I’m always like, “Yes bitch, let me try it.” And I will say that I think that the star
of the show was the dissolving spray. It’s crazy how quick
it took everything off. Now, it does say powerful and
gentle on there, which I love. But fter looking at the ingredients, I am so
happy because this is an oil free formula. There’s no alcohol or
harsh ingredients in it. So this is pretty cool and its allergy
tested, and my skin feels really good. I’m kind of like shocked to be
honest. I’m like, “Ah okay”. I mean you never really know what to expect
when you’re trying something new. So when it actually really works
well, I’m always like, “Yes!” Alright you guys. And the lip remover
really broke it down immediately. I did have to go in twice but
it said on here that you would. So it didn’t lie and say anything
that it’s supposed to do. And like all of this stuff like
really worked amazing. So I am going to use this for the
next month and see how I’m loving it, see if my skin feels
any other type of way. But right now my skins
feeling really nice. It definitely wants
a tiny bit of hydration. There we go. Now I’m feeling
a little bit more like myself. Ahh! Cool, that’s it, you guys.
I can’t believe it. I’m so used to putting on so much makeup,
I’m like “Oh my god, I took it off. This is so weird.” But thank you guys
so much for watching. Let me know down below in the comments
section which product you thought worked best. I mean I think they all worked. But tell me what your favorite
one was or if you’ve tried it out. And I will see you guys
on the next video. Mwah! Bye! 
What's up everybody?
Welcome back to my channel. Today we're doing part two of the full face
first impressions using all new makeup. I guess it's gonna be
a series on my channel. You guys will have to let me know if
you want me to continue doing these. But the first one that I did
last month, you guys loved. And I think I buy way too much makeup
so it's fun to like accumulate it all where all the new stuff that I've got in
the last weeks and just try it all at once. I mean, hi, it save a lot
of you guys' time cause I know a lot of you love to watch and
 see if things work or if they do not work. Now today's video's gonna be really fun
because I want a little ham and so forth, so I got a lot of new products and I also got
some new stuff from Alta and the drugstore, stuff that I have never used before that
you guys have actually recommended. So today we're going to dive into all
of that and try it all on my bare skin. So if you guys want to see me play with
new makeup, then keep on watching. All right now. Sometimes it's kind of hard to find
a full face of like every single product so there are a few things
that I am missing. But I think I got most everything. So I was browsing on Sephora.com and Doctor
 Brandt who is of course an amazing skincare line, they have something brand new
out called the Illuminizer Primer. Now this is allegedly something that is
gonna give me a natural backlit glow, revive my dull complexion, and
help refine the look of pores. I'm like okay girl, if anyone says that they can minimize
pores and give a nice flawless look, I'm down for.  All right, so this says to apply
on clean moisturized skin. Put this over on desired areas
for a natural radiant look. Okay guys so let's just
use one hand over here. Oh it smells really fresh. Oh it feels a little tacky which is great because
you know foundation is going to stick to the skin. Let's do a little bit more
for the forehead. All right this is dry on my skin.
It feels good. Okay. So for foundation I'm going to be trying
out the new Tarte clay stick foundation.  Now this just hit the market
and I bought three shades. Of course you guys all know what
a stick foundation looks like by now but this color, I mean
I'm just gonna go like this. I mean that looks like
a really good match. This one was light beige
and this one is fair beige. All right, definitely this one is too light. I probably could work with that
but I like how this one is looking so I am going to stick to light beige. Let me go wipe this off
and I'll be right back. All right now I am not sure what kind of finish
 or coverage this is supposed to give me and I could stop and Google it but you
know what, let's just see what happens. I don't want to put too much on because
God knows it could be really full coverage and then I'm gonna be like oh. Now Beauty Blender just put out
a new little trio for the summer. I bought two packs. I'm gonna be doing another giveaway with a bunch of
brand new makeup soon so this will be going in there. But I unboxed it yesterday and
 I used it for the first time. Of course it's the same Beauty
Blender. It's just different colors. That hot green one is speaking
to my soul right now. Okay, so before this dries or gets weird, let's buff it out
and see what kind of coverage we're gonna get. On the realest level up close,
I have a mirror right in front of me.  You guys, this looks really pretty like it's full
coverage but my skin looks like really nice. On the real fucker tee you all! I did not expect the stick
foundation to be this natch. I'm like looking close up like girl. It leaves a beautiful finish on the skin. It does not look too heavy but
it is a full, I think it's medium. I probably could add a little bit more
 but I love how this is looking. I don't see the reason to add anymore. Wow! Okay, let's move on to concealer. All right you guys so we were about
 to try a new drugstore concealer but I opened it up and the lightest shade
was darker than my normal skin tone. So I found another concealer that I have not
 used yet by one of my favorite brands, La Mer. It looks like this minus
all my fingerprints on it but I haven't tried this yet and
 this is seventy-five dollars. I'm like this better conceal my fucking life
 and my attitude after I am done using it. So this is the lightest shade
in this brand as well. Still I don't think it's light enough for
 me but we will see in a second. So I'm just gonna take a little of
 it and go under the eye like that. I'm just gonna take my Beauty Blender
and bounce this away. Okay, so far, so good. It looks really like a lightweight on here. It's not like really crazy,
it's not cakey. But did it do a lot though?  Not really. All right so now that
this is all blended out, am I living for it? I mean, I don't think
it really did that much.  I mean I am gonna be the one that
 says it probably right off the bat that for $75 I should be wowed and right now I am kind of looking at
myself like mmm, hmm, I'm bored. Next product. For setting the under-eyes and the concealer
 I am going to be using the new Dermablend, what is this? The loose setting powder. Now I have seen a lot of people use this lately
and they are ranting and raving about it so I had to get it myself. Now there are a few colors.
I just got Original. I think that it's supposed
to be translucent. Comes in a standard
little package like this and let's see if she works. Oh, oh wow! Okay girl, what the hell! Oh it's like a big old, like almost like when you open
up a pill bottle and you have to take out the cotton. I think this is what this is. Okay, I'm just gonna put
a little bit of this right here. Let's see what happens. And let's let that sit for a second
and I am about to brush it away. I am going to be using this new
 little cute Tarte Unicorn brush and I'm just gonna brush
away my problems. All right, the setting powder, let me go,
 let me zoom in here for a minute. I mean, it set everything really, really nice. Okay. Now I know a lot of people have been
ranting and raving about the, what is this? This is from the brand Charlotte Tilbury and this is the Airbrush Flawless
Finish Skin Perfecting Micro powder. I need some water. Now notice I'm gonna avoid all the areas
that I have the concealer under.  I really don't like to dip in and put powder over
 powder over powder where it doesn't need it. So I'm just gonna set the rest of the face
where I don't have any concealer.  It looks amazing, like up close you
guys, right in front of me, I'm like. Okay, so now we're going to move on to,
let's try some bronzer you guys. Let's do a little highlighting. Now I do have some exciting new
products I've been dying to use. The new Koko Kollection from
Chloe and Kylie Cosmetics is here and if you open it up you get a blush, two highlighters
 and a bronzer/contour color we're gonna call it. I’m gonna try them out today. I wanna see what the tee is. Now this bronzer close up has shimmer in it when
 I'm looking at it and what is the bronzer called? This is Hollywood Boulevard bronzer. That took me like five minutes
to figure that out. Wow, that is very pigmented. All right the face is warmed
up. I love this bronzer. I was a little scared that it's gonna
 be like too, like orangey on me and there's no like shimmer
once it's on the skin. In the pan it looks a little glittery
 but on the skin it's matte, it's soft, it's really nice,
doesn't look too harsh. Definitely not what I expected
 and I'm really living for it. Hmm! Now I love this brush
because you literally just go bam! Nose is contoured. All right. Now I think because
there is a blush in this palette, we might as well try it and the
blush is called Rodeo Drive, one of my favorite places in LA
and I am going to, one, two. Now I do love the formula
of the Kylie blushes. Now these, just from looking at it,
they look to be like the same formula. Okay, I'm going a little
too crazy there. So I'm just going to press it into the skin. Oh! There is definitely pigment. I've just been really into like peachy, warm
tone blushes lately and I really like this color. Bam! All right. Haa, let's get to my favorite
part of the day, highlighting. All right. Now today we're going to be trying out
the new Huda Beauty 3D highlighter palette. Now there are two highlighter palettes. This one is the Golden Sands edition. There is also a Pink Sands but this
one looked more up my alley. Now the cool thing about this is that one is a cream
 highlighter and I think the rest are powders. Now I did swash this earlier cause
 I didn't know it was a cream and I touched it and I was like,
oh! It's a cream, okay. So it says to apply this as
a base to smooth skin and then you can add things on
 top of it to make it really intense and I think this one might be more
of like a blushy highlighter. So I am down to try these two. So Phegee is the, this is a cream you guys
 so you touch it and it's like woa! I mean. And then Seychelles is this
gorgeous highlighter. I'm just gonna swash it with a clean
finger and that is a powder. Ohh but they feel really buttery. And that's what these two look like so
 hopefully they look good on my skin. All right so I'm gonna use a little Mac synthetic fiber
brush and we're gonna dip into shade Phegee here and I am just going to put this
 right on top of the contour. Definitely not good. I mean obviously it feel like a subtle
glow you could wear this on your skin even without foundation it would
probably look stunning. But for me, you guys know I am a highlighter
 freak and this is not blinding enough.  I'm only gonna do one side of the face first cause
what if I don't like it, I don't wanna do both sides. Let's dip into shade Seychelles,
and ooh okay. Let's see what happens on me. That is really, really pretty. Like these, the blush, the contour
and this together I'm like hmm. It is glowing. I'm like look at the way when
I shift my face hmm. Okay and I'm just gonna put
that all on the brow bone. All right now I'm also gonna take that same cream and
 powder combo and do my cupid's bow of course.  I think Huda Beauty has another hit on her
hands because this palette is so pretty and I'm doing some of the highlighter on my brow and
 above the brow bone for some crazy alien dimension. I've been really loving the no brow look lately
 and there is actually no new brow products from really any brand that
I could find this month. So we're just gonna add our
highlight until my face falls off. So now let's get started on the eyes. Now I'm going to be using the new
ColorPop I Love serahe collaboration which, oh my God you guys, I was really excited
 about this because the packaging is stunning and I just love all the lip swatches I was seeing
online but the eye-shadows were speaking to me. So this one Chic-y is [inaudible].
It's stunning. Let me show you all,
let me show what's in here. Oh my God this wasn't even my favorite one
 but this is obviously really pretty as well. Now the ColourPop eye-shadow formula,
I haven't really used it on my channel.  I have definitely tried it off-camera
and it's pretty good, I will say that. Now this palette, there are two. $aucy, that's the one where the colors are
 always speaking to me, not gonna lie. Look at this y'all, look at that! Yummy! This needs to go right here and
these three need to go right here. Definitely might dip into this one as well
but this one, I think $aucy is it for me.  Like it looks really pretty. All right. So I love this light shade here. It looks like a vanilla matte and I'm
 just gonna be dipping into there and putting it all over the lid and
 right under the brow bone. Now these have a lot of pigment. I barely tapped in there
and it's like "Good morning." Now I'm gonna be dipping into this one. Oh the names are on
the back, by the way. So this one is called Freckles, that is so
cute and I'm gonna use this same brush and I'm just gonna barely tap in there
because these are extremely pigmented and I'm just gonna tuck that
into the crease a little bit. All right. Now we're gonna
move over to the other palette and there is a shade called Chic Happens and
it's like a beautiful light toned mauve right here  and same brush again you guys, and I'm just going
 to take that and place it right over that crease. So where normal people's brows
 would be I'm bring that shadow up. Now we're gonna take the shade Lit with a little synthetic
brush and let's see oh, okay pigment, come on now. I'm gonna coat the entire brush. Just gonna pat this on my lid
and see how this looks. I love, love how this color
like looks in the pan. All right now I think the metallics have
a little bit more fall-out than the mattes. I'm like girl but they are really pigmented
so it's definitely forgivable.  All right you guys I think this
color is so pretty on the lid. All right now we're gonna go in
 with this shade called the Razy. It's like a dark plum purple
and I am living for it. And we're just gonna
tuck it right in there. Bam! And bring it to the lash line so it just
 gives us some drama if you will. Then I'll go back and forth with that other light
mauve shade and I'll just really blend it out to fill. This is looking really pretty.
These shadows are blending amazing. Now I am going to go in with that stunning, like it's
almost orangy, frosty duo chrome type of moment and that shade is called Heavy Glam. Now I might wet the brush for added intensity but for
 now I'm just gonna be using a little pencil brush and we're just gonna go in here. Oh we had the brush,
it's coated really quickly. So I definitely don't want
any crazy fall-out. I just want to put it really in my inner
corner almost over that purple. Oooh yes! Oh wow! Okay I already see where this color
is going and it looks really pretty. So I'm just going to take some Coconut Fix Plus from
Mac and I'm just gonna wet the brush if you will. All right now I'm gonna take that
and just place it a little bit more. Ooh has like a pinky shift to it too. That is so pretty. This is such a unique shadow
color like you'd better work bitch.  Okay now I'm definitely gonna smoke out the under
 eyes with that same dark color I put right in here. So let's get to buffing. These shadows are so pigmented. It's like you gotta really be
careful and that's a good thing. So I'm gonna take a little bit of that light shade and
 just kind of go under the eye, blend her down to fill. Bam, bam bam! I'm like
I only have time to blend. All right, so I'm just applying a little bit of this
Chic Happens shade underneath the purple.  I think it's a really cool way to blend it out and
give you a really extreme type of smokey eye. I think the only thing missing is
some color in the water line which could be a bright color
 or we could just do black. We could do white. I think black would be really cool
just cause it'd kinda make it tie in. So I don't have any new eyeliners.
I know you guys are like, really bitch. I really don't. I mean who's put out
new eyeliners lately. I don't know but if you guys know
a brand or anything new I should try, of course always sound off below and
let me know some good stuff to buy. But for now we're going back
to my trusty Mac Smolder. I've been using this entire
school and it works. Now I think it's time to move on to some
mascara and today I have two different types. One of them I'm scared to use
with this look but I think it will. If we're gonna try it, we're
gonna try it in this video. So the first one is one
that Tati recommended. Of course you guys know her as Glam Life
Guru aka Tati Westbrook here on YouTube. I live for her and she recommended this mascara. Now the price point you all
don't wanna know the price point. But it allegedly makes
your lashes grow longer and it has ingredients in this that
 will actually make your lashes. Well, here let me just read it. It says "With continuous use your natural
 lashes will appear longer and fuller. It has additional peptides that help build stronger,
longer lashes, super volume and extreme black." So I'm like oh my God! All right, so this is from
a brand called Chantecaille. Now this is called the Faux Cils
Longest Lash black mascara. Woo! So of course for the hefty price tag of $70,
it comes in this little purple thing and then you come, it comes
out like this and voila! Oh my God it feels light.  It feels light.
I'm sure it works. We're about to see. Now obviously doesn't mean the formula
doesn't work just because it feels a little cheap but hey, let's see what happens. All right so you guys can see the
difference between one side. So of course this one has all the mascara. This eye is blank.
It does give you a nice length. I mean for the price point I'm sure, I'm gonna
obviously try this for like a few weeks and see if it actually makes
my lashes grow any more. But for $70, I'm like...
and you all know me. I don't give a fuck about
spending money on makeup. I'm all down to invest
and play around but if it's not doing anything like out of the ordinary
right away, I don't know bitch, I don't know. Oh my God you guys I already forgot
I was about to try another mascara like we're talking double brands today. So okay, we tried this one,
hope fully it works long lasting. At the end of the day it's pretty but
for the price point, I don't know bitch. Mac recently put out a bunch of new
colored mascaras and they are bright. This one is called Energize. It is a literally hot yellow and I thought what better
look to try this on with dark shadow underneath. But I know that when you pull this out,
that is straight up neon yellow. So for bottom mascara
is it gonna work? I guess we will find out right now. Let's see what happens. All right you guys, for bottom mascara like
 the bristles and the wand is so huge. So it was a little difficult to get under there,
but I mean it has full coverage like opaque pigment. So okay, cool. This is definitely different for me and I haven't
 done colored mascara in a long time. I love pink mascara, and I love blue. Yellow though, I don't know. I almost wanna try this again
with like no makeup on. Really just soft pretty then just do
yellow on the top and bottom. But that's for later. All right, so today for fake lashes, for falsies,
we're gonna be using the brand Cake Face Beauty. Now they are the same brand that clog with
 Kim Thai and I was like you know what, I want to try more of her lashes
because those were amazing. All right these lashes are glued
down and I'm really living for them. They're really, they're really pretty. I'm like looking at them up close
like Woo! Come on volume. All right you guys we're almost
down to the finish line. Of course we have
to do a liquid lipstick. I mean this is a, this is by Stiehler. This is the Be Legendary Liquid Metal
 lipstick and this in shade Petal Metal. So this shade is a stunning
 like a rose gold metallic. Okay, let's see how she works. All right you guys, we have one
last step of course setting spray. Not a day goes by that
I don't set this face. So, the brand Milk Makeup, they
put out a brand new setting spray. It's called the Blur Spray and it's supposed
to instantly minimize the appearance of pores and provides a soft focus
blur effect on all skin tones. An invisible mist sets makeup all day. It is infused with some
good old organic ingredients so it's supposed to be leaving
your skin soft and hydrated.  Shake well before use. All right baby let's see
what she looks like. Ooh, this is cute. Okay girl, let's see what happens. Let's get her going. There we go. Oh my God, it like pumps out like a lot. Woo! All right. I am feeling doused. Let me just buff that
really good into the skin. Now did it do anything?
Let me look. For now I mean it feels good. My makeup does feel set which I love. So you guys I think this is the final look. The final look I'm living for. I think it's a really fun,
it's definitely different. I'm so not sure how I feel
about the yellow mascara. It's definitely like taking it to another
 realm and I'm not mad at it. I mean it worked. I think
I'm looking at my desk. The things that really stuck out the most for me
today, has to be the Tarte Clay Stick foundation.  I mean that was unreal. Concealer, not so much,
didn't really care about it. The Charlotte Tilbury face powder though
left me feeling like I looked twelve again and my pores were vanished so that
combo together I'm kinda hooked. And the primer, I'm not mad at the primer,
but I don't know if it worked or not cause obviously you guys know
I do have pretty normal skin. So it's kind of hard for me to try primers for
 me to see if they actually really, really work. But I don't know what
kind of recipe I did today but these two combined
left me looking flawless. And I think another thing to really
rave about is the highlighter palette. Oh my God my cheeks are like glowing
from outer space and I'm obsessed with it. I think the eye-shadows
worked really amazing. The bronzer from Kylie was great. We got a lot of really cool things today. I think the only thing I would really, I don't
want to say I would pass on the mascara. Obviously we know that my lashes might
 be growing right now, who knows. But I will give this a whirl in a few more
videos and of course off-camera and we'll see if anything happens. But besides that I think I liked
most everything. I'm shocked. I was like I'm waiting for me
to try out a bunch of products that just don't work for me which
does happens sometimes but today, thank you Lord,
I got lucky. All right you guys, let me know if you guys
want me to continue to do this series. If you want part three, four, five six and seven,
but I always have a lot of fun trying new makeup. So as always, thank you for watching
and I'll see you on the next one. Mwaah! Bye guys. 
What's up, everybody?
Welcome back to my channel. Today I am doing a $2,500
Ulta Beauty haul. Jesus take the wheel. So I've been getting a lot of requests lately after
I did my full face E.L.F. video in January. Everyone was like, "Okay, girl. Where's the [inaudible] drugstore, bitch?

most requested on Twitter today. That's right. So we're doing a little field trip. We're gonna buy out the Ulta of all the drugstore
products, and I am here to help Jeffree. Yes. So I'm sure you know some
great products from each brand That really actually work. And then maybe you'll be shady,
get me some stuff that doesn't work. I sure will. I sure will. The most like suggestions
on a product ever From today was the Maybelline
Age Rewind Concealer? Oh, yes. Is that's what it's called? Favourite. Truly the best. Is it really? It reminds me of Tarte a little bit-- So I know you're gonna love it. That's sick. You'd better fucking love it. So many people kept
sending me that picture. Okay, so we're literally… Ulta is only 3.4 miles
away right now. So, let's pop in and say hi. All right, Ulta. Let's see what the fuck
you've got for Ms. Jeffree here. All right, ya'll. We're getting every
liquid to matte lipstick possible today. Unlike other influencers, I actually
go out and buy the makeup. I don't email and ask because I don't
have the time. I wanna film now. Laura helped me get so much shit. This is one bag of mix. Look at all…
Oh, my God. So we bought the whole store. This shit's heavy. Like if I wanna try a brand,
I wanna motherfucking try a brand. Yes, you’re right. They're already working on the Maybelline bag. And let's roll.
So we're gonna go try to check out right now. Come on, Ulta. Yes, bitch. Oh, I’m getting a little
bit of workout, like oh. All right, we are back in the studio. I have some makeup on now
so I don't look like I'm dying. And I got so many items today. And obviously I'm not gonna
be able to show them all off. But my whole point was
to get enough products To do a full face of Maybelline
and also a full face of NYX. Now, which video do you
guys wanna see first? I'm gonna leave a pinned
comment down below And just sound off and let me know if
you wanna see Maybelline first or NYX. Regardless, I'm gonna film
both over the next few weeks. But I wanna hear what
you guys want first. So I am just going to open up
the first bag. Oh, my Lord. Now, Nathan helped
unwrap all this stuff Because so much of it had plastic on it and my…
you see this nails, girl? I am not removing any
plastic this month. So, I'm just gonna dive in here and
let's see what the hell we got. The cool thing about this is I really haven't
played with most of these products, you know. You guys know I'm a luxury brand whore,
but I have been diving into a lot of drugstore stuff lately, and a lot
of it is like amazing. I feel like when I was younger and
I was falling in love with makeup, the drugstore products, over all the formulas,
they were a little scarring. They were not good. I remember being in like
ninth grade. Like stealing... yeah, I did steal. I did steal makeup from the drugstore,
which I do not advise on ever doing. Oh, my God. Anyway, so back in the day
when I was like really getting into makeup, a lot of the stuff in the drugstore
I was like, "Girl." But all of a sudden, the last few years they
have really stepped it up and I am in shock. So I'm just gonna dive in here. This is
the first bag. Oh, my God. It is so heavy. Let's just pull out the first thing.
And I see the… now, I kinda separated the bags to like Maybelline, NYX,
and random stuff. I got some perfume as well. So this is the wear boosting setting
spray, The Master Fix. Okay. Now, come on. Setting
spray whore? Right here. So I cannot wait to try this out. Girl,
I know this isn't even the fucking tutorial but… Okay, girl. Maybelline has so many,
like face products. Now, I got a bunch of like everything. So we have the, the classic Maybelline Fit Me
matte poreless foundation. Now, when I tweeted that I was gonna buy
Maybelline stuff I asked you all, "What so you recommend?" So many of you
said this formula, so I can't wait to try it. Now, a lot of the stuff
I got like different shades. So I'm sure a lot of you saw that price
at the end of the receipt and you were like, "Bitch, are you out of your fucking mind?"
But here's the deal. I can't swatch and test everything
in the store, so I got like, you know, If I'm gonna get a foundation,
I got like three of these each. Also got the Dream Cushion liquid
foundation on-the-go. Okay. I'm not really into cushion foundation
but I'm gonna start trying more 'cause so many brands
have them out now. So, Definitely be on the lookout for that. See, what have we got here?
Matte poreless powder. Thank God. And then we have
the Master contour. Oh, my God. My first ever drugstore
video from like a year and a half ago, I used this. It's actually amazing. I donated it
to a women's shelter like a year ago, So I'm glad to have it back. I literally
tried it once and I was like, "You know what, I have
so much makeup. Girl." We have this setting and
perfecting loose powder. More Dream Cushion. And then I think…
Are these new? The Fit Me blushes? So they have a whole Fit Me line,
is obviously what I'm finding out here. And then, what do we have here?
Color contour lip palette. Let's open her up. Girl, don't play me.
There we go. Okay, so this is-- oh, so this is
literally like lipsticks are in here. I kinda wanna touch one. Is that weird?
Let's use the brush. Okay, let's just dive into one of these.
Let's see what happens. I'm just gonna do a little swatch
right here. Oh! Okay, color pale. That's not bad. Now, with these,
I like to do like a lip liner and then fill it in. And these work amazing. Oh,
my God, there's more face stuff. Okay, everyone who said, "Bitch,
if you don't try the Baby Skin primer, we're gonna slap you
across your mouth." And they have something that is called
the Dream Velvet soft matte hydrating foundation. How the fuck am I gonna do a tutorial
with all these foundations? I'm gonna have to like try them
out like throughout the year because there's so many formulas.
I'm like, "Maybelline, slow it down." Now, what else do we got here?
Oh, my God. We got more of each. You guys know,
what did I say earlier? So many… you guys all requested
and gave me the advice to get the Instant Age Rewind Erase Dark Circle.
Laura Lee said That this is very similar
to the Tarte Shape Tape. Obviously, we'll see about that, because
this is one of my favorite formulas. But I'm excited. And look
at that little applicator. Okay. We also got so many
eyeshadow palettes. The 24K nudes, the Graffiti nudes.
I'm like, "I just wanna swatch one of these." Is there any pale?
Don't fucking try me, honey. Now, eyeshadows in the drugtstore,
even high-end like Tom Ford it comes with these
little applicators. I never use them. But this blue one is speaking to my
soul. Is there names on this? No names. Okay. I mean, it's cute.
It's not as sheer as I thought, I'll be really honest. Now, obviously,
my hand is... my hand has no primer or anything like I would on my lip, but…
This is pretty. Okay, and then just because
I really wanna try this pink. I'm like dying. Let's see what happens. I mean that ain't bad. These two together would be kinda cute.
Let's move on. Great Lash. My grandma was
using this when I was a baby. I used to wear this
like in high school. Definitely in high school,
this was my thing. And I haven't, honestly, like held
one of this in so long. I love how thick the bristle is.
It's like, "Good morning!" Now, you guys, I'm trying to like speed talk
because there are so many things here. So if you're like, "Girl, slow it down,"
I can't. Okay. We also got the primer base. This is supposed to… oh, the Master
Prime blur and smooth, Which you know I'm all down for that.
We've got more blushes. I got like the little peachy, brown one.
Now, I also got the Big Chop mascara. You know Manny MUA
was in that commercial and appeared in front of all my videos for
the last few months, and I never tried it. Am I a horrible friend? No.
Life has been so busy. I haven't had… I really honestly haven't
had any time, but— This applicator reminds me
of like Dior show mascara. Okay. So Laura recommended that
I get these color tattoo eye chromes. I guess they're supposed to be
like amazing on the lid so… I just wanna swatch on my hand real quick.
That has like a lot of pigment. Look at that. That is so pretty.
I just wanna pop that like right there. I got a bunch of those colors,
so I will, of course, try them out. And then Laura also like recommended
the 24-hour color tattoo. I think I've used these once like a year ago
and… Oh, it's like a… oh, it's like a gel. My hands are gonna be a mess.
That definitely has a lot of payoff. That could be like right on the lid, on the eye.
Easy to smudge out. That's cute. Okay. Now, this illuminating highlighter.
Girl. Heard this shit's bomb. And you know what?
I'm opening it right now. It's sealed. Damn. And this is in...
what is this shade? Shade light/iridescent. All right, let's see what happens.
I'mma look into the monitor. Oh! Okay. This reminds of like the cover FX drops like
with the same type of payoff. Oh, my God. That is really pretty. Okay, besides that, you guys,
from Maybelline I got so many lipsticks. I literally took every nude lip off
of their rack and I thre it in my bag. You guys recommended
so many of these. I know that Manny and Patrick
love the nude lipsticks. So you guys know I'll be wearing these.
Hot Sand, Naked Coral. Hot Sand looks so pretty. I'm just like
gagging right now. Let's swatch her. Oh, my God. So creamy. I'm like… I mean,
that is full pigment. I'm like, "Okay, drugstore. I see you." Moving on. What else is in this crazy bag.
Oh, come on, Juicy Couture. I used to wear their perfumes
all the time. I've kinda like going through a phase where
I've been wearing a lot of other stuff right now. Oh, my God. It's like a cupcake.
Yes! This is so cute. So, this bag, you guys, is full of lip liners,
more eyeshadow stuff. Like it is… there's no way I'm gonna even
to be able to show you all of this stuff, but… I got lip pencils, I got more
eyeshadows, more lipsticks. I mean there is fistfuls of drugstore
in here. It is insane. All right, this bag is empty.
Let's move on. All right. Now we have
bag number two. Okay, so let's move on to…
oh, my God. I have two bags of NYX. How do they
have so many skews, you guys? My head exploded when
I walked up to the aisle. And I thought there was only one aisle,
and I was like, "Where's all the foundations?" And that girl that worked there, she was
like, "Other side." Whole other wall. and I'm like, "Oh, my God."
Back to back gondolas. It was insane. I'm just gonna start pulling stuff out, you guys.
I cannot show it all 'cause it's so intense. Look, I'd no idea. These are the Lingerie
liquid lipsticks, cashmere silk. So basically… oh, maybe that's
the color name. Sorry. These are liquid lipsticks from NYX.
You guys probably all wear them at home. A lot of you recommended them
to me. There is so many nudes. I literally think NYX was like, "Girl, we're gonna
come for every nude on the planet." They definitely accomplished that.
I mean, what the fuck? And-- well, definitely a full, full
coverage with this one. Thank you, Jesus. This color
is speaking to me. This one is called Dusk to Dawn.
Let’s see whatchu got here. Wow. That is beautiful. Okay. And then… I mean you guys know I'm not gonna
swatch all of this right now. But I do wanna try one more. This one is called Exotic. It's almost
like a reddish brown tone. That is really pretty. Okay, I see you.
So many of you were like, "Bitch, if you don't try the liquid suedes."
This is a cream lipstick. And it comes like this. And…
same flat wand. Oh, wow. That is like pretty. I'm like,
"Come on, summer. I see you." We've got concealers. We have,
of course, brow products. We have the Vivid Bright, which I'm
a huge fan of but I only have the pink color, which if you guys are wondering for
my brows today I used the pink one. Okay, so we got all o' dem. And then
I got all the brow products. So we got… what is this? Oh, it's an eyeshadow
base. This is not a brow. Okay. It tricked me. I got eyeshadows,
I got liquid highlighters. And then, what else have we got?
We got pencils, we have eyeliner. We have… oh, what is this?
Oh, lip liner. Oh, this is cute. So many primers. All of you requested that
I try every primer in here, which I don't know how that's
gonna happen but I'm gonna try. So we got photo-loving primer.
And then we have the liquid illuminator. Probably like, you know, the liquid
highlighter, I'm gonna assume. Thank you, Lord. And then this one, everyone said
to try the Angel Veil primer. I think this is like a fan. old-school favorite
from everyone so I can't wait to try that. Oh, my God. I got every makeup brush I could
find from them because here's the thing. Once I felt this with my finger in the store
I was like, "Oh, my God. So soft." So I'm gonna be
using all those, of course. More concealers, eyepencils. What is this?
Oh, this is a grey liquid lip. Oh, my God, I can't wait to try that. Okay, this bag is basically done, y'all.
Let's move on to the third bag. Oh, my God. Now what I'm really excited for…
sorry, I'm being noisy, Is the new total cover foundation.
These are like a drop foundation. Lemme just open one. Now this may be a little light for me, but you guys
know I already got a lot more shades. Don't judge me. But this
is like a little dropper. That is so cute. And looks like
the Iconic London dropper. Remember this highlighter I tried on
my channel like two months ago? It looks like the same
dropper and I love them. Now of course I got the infamous
contour palette. Everyone says that this is kind of like
a dupe for the Anastacia one. We'll be the judge of that. And then
I got so many eyeshadow palettes. We have the perfect filter,
we have the avant pop. Laura, your hair is in this bag, okay?
It's your weave, bitch. I see the color. Wicked dreams. That's a… I mean,
those panels are tiny but, hey, if you like stuff on the go or do you
wanna travel? Perfect. Okay. Now, we even got the matte finish spray.
We have the dewy finish spray. I might just do it all and see what
the fuck happens. Oh, my God. This is like cleansing balm stripped off.
Laura put this in the bag, and she said it was kind of like the Clinique
take the day off balm. Very similar. I mean it looks like the same packaging
almost. Oh, it's sealed. Okay. Well, when I take off my makeup after
the video, whenever I film it, we'll try it out. We have eyeliners, there's a million palettes.
We have more shadow palettes. I mean it is just endless.
I even got the gel eyeliners. Everyone online was like, "Girl,
the cosmic gel eyeliners are it." Oh, my God, there's more palettes? Laura,
what the fuck did you put in this bag, girl? Be gone makeup remover wipes. I should
have been using this the whole time. There's more eyeshadows,
more lipsticks. Conceal and correct contour.
So we got creams… we got creams. All right. You guys get the gist
There are so many products. It's gonna take me awhile
to go through them all. But I will say this.
Ulta, girl, you had it all. You really had it all. A lot of the times when I go into drugstores like
Walgreens, so many things are out of stock, and I wanna go try something that you
guys recommend and it's not there. So, hi. Ulta has a lot of the stuff. Of course they don't have every brand
that [inaudible] do have or CVS, But they do have a lot of cool stuff and
they're constantly like new brands in there, so it's exciting. But at the end of the day,
I have a lot to play with. And if anyone else wnats to help come over
and organize my makeup room with me, I would really appreicate it.
But all right, you guys. Thank you so much for
watching this crazy haul. Now, the cool thing about being a makeup
artist is a lot of this is a tax writeoff. Now, listen. If anyone wants to judge anyone
for how much money they spend, turn off your computer, go in a dark
corner and stare at the wall and come back after your
timeout's done, okay? No, for real, I know
people always judge. Most of you guys are like, "Cool. It's your job.
No one cares, it's your channel." Someone people wanna try to like
say whatever they want to say. At the end of the day,
it's makeup, it's my passion, My love, and I'm gonna buy
whatever the fuck I want. So, thank you guys so much
for watching this haul. If you want another haul,

all can we talk about blood sugar for a second like two days ago the pre-order is sold out as well so I'm just like it's overwhelming like this is such a amazing feeling from just starting three years ago you guys - now I just can't believe how much has happened with YouTube with my brand with my entire life it's just all so it's a lot overwhelming and I think sometimes life just moved so quickly you kind of forget to really like I don't know take it all in like sometimes I'm just on the go so much I don't even really get to celebrate some accomplishments because I'm already you know on to the next moment but blood sugar was just such a cool like I always say a moment but it's such a cool moment like and still for it to sell out and then a pre-order to sell out I'm like I can have any palettes to like fucking the end of March or April but I am gonna make it permanent it is a permanent item so if you guys want it you will get it I know waiting sucks sometimes but hey okay well we're looking snatch all right now I'm taking a little Bobby Bobby blender Bobby Brown eye blender and we're just gonna dip into glucose again just soften tongue pop out a little bit now let's take this little morphe blending brush and let's dip into shade cavity do we want to do a cavity or do we want to do cherry soda I'm looking right now like you do both right I mean hi it's my palette let's do cherry soda first so we're gonna take cherry soda and start packing it right in there and coming down on the lid Oh who's your master done yeah you're real quick hey yeah rubber baby oh yeah it looks so old whoa it feels like um yeah I mean it's a little rubber mmm oh my god your facial hair this is gonna be so wait now I hope I don't pop my little hairs right oh my god I'm like look what's right under him oh yeah she's going over here somebody throw that on there whoa oh it's coming up easy huh I wonder what makes up oh my let's take jiggly it's like oh it really is not that bad actually okay so were you getting a wipe off the excess hmm okay I don't feel overall it feels nice and hydrated you don't feel old and bitter anymore yeah all right we are blended down to the gods and now we're gonna go into shade extraction and we're just gonna go with this little pointed brush we're just gonna add a little bit of depth in there so my crease looks so fucking deep set anyone else live in Michigan because in a two days I'm gonna go visit my house and Grand Rapids do some work on it visit Nate's parents Nate's actually going to LA because our daughter drama cannot be left alone in my eyes for more than a day or two so one of my close friends was at my house right now watching all the dogs but girl I'm like me drama does not want to be left alone so I got to go make sure the house is secure this is looking really cute and then I'll be back in LA for two days and then I'm off somewhere else it just never ends you guys the plane rides the lack of sleep all right now we're gonna take a highlighting brush we're actually going to dip into shade candy floss and we're gonna act like a buffer almost like a highlighter you can actually use it as a highlighter if you want baby when you put this on the like mixing with tongue pop and cherry soda it just gives it this like no it's just so pretty David my hair is acting like the Rugrats that's what happens in you say hey David can you do my hair and you have two minutes it was yeah look at this well fell flat in the back alright so we're just putting candy floss all the way up here literally we're just blending David you should do candy floss for highlighter tomato okay yeah look something fucking yes JLo yes I'm living for this moment okay guys let's we're okay we're doing this brush again we're going in a tongue pop we're actually just gonna take this before we do anything else and just drag it under our lash line and we're just gonna smoke it out really easy alright cool this is looking really pretty now I'm actually going to add a little bit more and then we should be good I am living for this red fantasy we definitely need to add some more cotton candy in the inner corner so we're gonna take this little brush no let's to a pencil brush my life I lied and I forgot my setting spray which is very depressing we do have this so we're just going to wet the brush a little bit and then we're gonna barely touch in there oh my god and we're just gonna add that right and name oh wow all right now to add a little pop of glitter we're gonna go in with the Stila this is shade wanderlust but this is the liquid eye shadow glitter and glow not to be confused with its older sister which now looks like this for the highlighter we used on the cheeks I mean is it the same formula I haven't even looked in the ingredients but I just want to have a little pop of glitter to my lid so we're gonna take this and just go right in there see that we're gonna connect cotton candy down there and then we're gonna go half way on our lid so we're not gonna cover up everything we're just gonna go half way and then to make sure that doesn't look nasty you can really take your finger if you want or a brush it doesn't really matter and you just kind of want to blend it so it goes together with your lid it doesn't let go chunky or chalky fingers work you guys now I really just need some liner and lashes all right now we're gonna go in with our roller lash from benefit we got to coat these lashes and of course we're gonna do some false lashes I brought a bunch of bears when I travel I always bring like 50 pairs you never know what kind of mood you're gonna be in when I follow tannaz tutorial and she did mascara after the lashes I'm still traumatized so thank you for that but we're of course gonna put our mascara on right now I feel so naked without it like I know how she does that all right you guys know I like to hold my breath while I'm doing my eyes I never really try to talk take a shot every time I say girl in my last seven videos okay sorry you guys I'm just on a girl okay when I was in eighth grade I started saying that like I would call grown-ass men who were six five I'm like what's up girl yeah girl remember the old days that's that was my childhood oh oh girl I would call the plumber girl I call the cable man the guy at fucking the grocery store I'm like Oh you guys epic fail mascara to the nose ha all right you guys I'm gonna go to the bathroom I'll be right back mother fucker look at me running my mouth about making fun of guys and calling them women our girl not women it was really just about like calling everyone girl but life was like be quiet thank you all right girl ha ha ha ha now Jayla show isn't for a while and we're gonna do some activities we're gonna gamble so I may not put any false eyelashes on I know a lot of you were like are you fucking kidding me so I don't know if I'm gonna do false lashes right now I think we should move on and then later after I'm done chilling and relaxing and dinner then maybe I'll pop some on so for this video ok so let's move on to lip I mean I don't even know I'm just gravitating towards a nude my hair is gonna be babe fuck I'm not used to these my hair might be baby pink it might be blonde I don't know yet but I think we should have stick to a nude lip so really my favorite nudes that I've ever made are mannequin and Christmas cookie I think since Christmas cookies a little newer let's use that one again [Music] all right now what I usually do when I go out and know in the real world I'll take this flawless powder and this chanel again and I'll kind of fine-tune at the Beautyblender and see any spots that may have creased a little or anything that needs a little extra product you know you're just kind of fine-tune what you've already created and bam you guys I think we are pretty much done remember I sadly forgot setting spray how how I have no idea so I'm just gonna use this one more time and I don't wanna do too much you can say something to my makeup so if I'm ever nervous about that I'll take the Beauty Blender again and I'll just kind of like press it in to the skin that's perfect timing since we are literally done literally and figuratively we just finished Nate oh really meaning me me and my hands look at my highlight yeah I glitter and metallic look hi JLo weeping

found some being online and this is a little crazy so tell you we're gonna attempt to try out color-changing makeup we have a blush that is black and it's cream and it looks gothic and insane and I'm kind of here for it yes we also have a lipstick that's black and sparkly and it's supposed to change colors something drastically different and then if that wasn't enough brother I mean honestly we have another crazy changing thing what this is the lipstick and I don't even know what the hell it looks like because I just bought it and I have no idea so we're gonna test it out now laura has actually tried out blush older version of just one exactly and if you would have watched my channel you would already know the outcome okay well alright you guys so if you want to see us try out all this crazy shit thank you for watching all right Laura Lee so excited to try this one out oh my gosh so this is the black lace rabbit blush from the brand lipstick Queen right now a lot of people roll their eyes because her lipsticks are very expensive yeah like their high price point right how much of this blush twenty-five dollars high-end makeup it's not the end of the world but it definitely ain't cheap and it no and it is a little small yeah we'll see on this channel this is a cheap item okay yes so this is what you get it is a the lace covered thing yes there is 0.7 ounces in here which is 2 grams okay let's open it up with sparkle okay wow it is a literally look what's crazy oh it does have glitter in it I mean I'm excited to try that remember when I made a black highlighter last year for Halloween and the whole internet dragged me and to fill yeah they did I'm like oh I don't know how many staples chalk jokes I've heard in my life but it's ok I made 5 million off of it alright anyway anyway on the realty is people have fun man black highlighters black blushes I'm down for it yes but this is color changing so it's not supposed to stay black it says that it turns a sheer berry color on the cheek to complement your unique skin tones it's a touch of gold shimmer ok hold on here it also this is a sexy haunting and first in the beauty world a black blush definitely think it's first Geoffrey they beat you to the punch okay I'm a little mad I'm like oh I guess mine is not coming out anymore now how do they recommend that you apply this so whenever I used it you could apply it with your finger or like a date from Beauty Blender just pat pat okay what about a dry Beauty sponge yeah totally okay so why don't we try I think we should try one on one cheek and the other end of the cheek okay cool and then the lips will wipe off what we have in our mouths and we'll try that in a minute so let's just try the blush first I'm dying to that just wanna just I think you should swatch around with your finger okay we're gonna take a clean finger here okay clean finger mm-hmm this finger wasn't Laura and it's about ten minutes ago it came out clean look at your finger right now you're gonna freak out oh wow it was like Barry looks like I squished a barrier between my fingers that's I think that's really cool I want to do it they did black and - Barry oh it's super creamy she was going with her fingers great honestly it's already all over a hand okay let's go for it I'm down to try it we can take a beauty sponge as well oh it has a mirror with it yep okay we're trying ready one two go oh I didn't know you slapped me across my face yesterday my concealer didn't show so we got a buffett and we can't we can't yet are you this is a little bit and I have a medium skin tone show this is a little bit strong mm-hmm oh and I have you got a punch to the face get done I'm sharing it is Li not so bad for me it's actually really pretty I'm not kidding I'm like oh I mean my finger is almost like it looks stained like yeah your finger is okay look it is okay right here oh and we're stained I can imagine it would stain a brush or a sponge I'm just gonna take it and kind of share it down a little bit it doesn't right let me do a little bit more in here let's try it with the Beauty Blender okay oh I don't know why I you know I did like uh-uh-uh and then start tapping it out and it turned out really pretty on my skin tone obviously it is a jar yes less is more as a super dark product so I mean I'm not looking I'm not hating it you guys know that it's kind of buff yeah you know what yeah I think you have to work with it you do and I think probably a little bit less so let me do a swatch my hand just for shits and giggles yeah I want to see it looks like shit and then once you like really work it it's not so bad yeah your first swatch look look like Kim cake so you got to step up your pussy bitch she knows how to swatch now okay well we had a moment we're good it was good let her swatch she's learning how to swatch leave her alone okay no it's actually pretty yeah it's really pretty actually adore it it's not very sticky I just want to say pretty much dried down snow ah but here's the thing did you see the glitter anywhere on your face zero so the glitter is just encapsulated you know butter there's not one drop of glitter so I would just say they put that in for shipping google says I don't know where the glitter winch but it's not there anymore it's there in the pan you can look close up it's there but it doesn't really come off on the cheek or skin it doesn't look at my swatch no littering shear lives okay since we're on the blush let's pop out the Frog Prince blush yes so this is the one that I've tried before and I'm excited for you doesn't want to pain yeah okay I love the contrast of pink and green whoa so this one looks really crazy it's green I kind of wish it was it was day green yeah okay so we're gonna go out there finger get it this is a great bit lighter let me do next to mine okay let me do it on the cheek see I already flip this is too much I want to do with the sponge wait I just want to do like right on here real quick what's like pink oil yeah vanishing like almost goes back dirty D see that looks clear yeah oh oh this is more like a softer flesh like this looks like I just finished the gangbang and I got a towel to wipe off all the fucking calm okay actually kind of like this I like them both and I feel like they look almost identical though on my cheeks what do you think um okay let me do oh there are doing a little bit same you look at me pretty but it looks the exact same so so actually now that you're saying that I'm pulling back the mirror very identical look no they really are like oh yeah I mean it was anyway that's kind of pretty - I like it a lot huh I mean honestly I'm not one to like use a cream blush every day I don't like I don't really either like they're not like my favorite but at the end of the day I reviewing the product it works yeah this one all right we got to a color-changing lipsticks here - morning sunshine and mine is black lace rabbit okay both have 3.5 grams in them what else does this thing say let's take this out so they're 24 bucks apiece okay that one says it sheer black with a fine gold shimmer a mysterious black flip six is like stockings hugging and accumulating the curves at your mouth for a fuller looking lips so fucking dramatic so sheer that has the effect of wearing black lace on your lips worn alone it casts a smoky veil worn over another full coverage lipstick it trims it transforms the color into a sexier smokier version we had to put it on we can have it I can try it alone and you can try it with it or we can oh wow look at the glitter you guys yeah that is cool let's show that Wow and then what is that one okay I have never tried this one oh it's in this pretty blue packaging in yellow right yeah it's really pretty oh my god yellow hey Alex fuckin boy geez just want to eat it I know me too cool let's both try another so laura is this crazy ass yellow shit it's supposed to transform your lives into a beautiful bright coral shade and it's super moisturizing apply straight from the bullet as is needed for the perfect colored lip okay if you think coral is perfect it's basically telling you that it's perfect without trying it well kind of like that fucking plan beep Ellie did the other day I'm kinda nervous tries out my crystal shoes no it's a lip scrub no let's redo it I love how clear it is wait it's changing now it is a little bit icy like right here my crust mm-hmm and her crust fucking hell I never thought hear that it is changing very faint okay so I buried you like a hand swatch to you this is annoying it's Sophie so for $24 you get a lip smackers look ten yeah basically great my turn all right so let's watch the black lace rabbit lipstick guy should ask Geoffrey what he tells me when I ask about personal life advice the honesty it's just painful it hurts but it's so real all right let's try this okay sleeping smut on your lips huh no surprises what if I went to my grandfather's ashes on my fireplace took a wet finger and dipped in and then rubbed it on my mouth honestly that looks so weird and I hate it and I know you like your dramatic moments but this is not one reminds me of he had me that black lip gloss over there mister my traditional black lip gloss for my July flops can I try that on it's the same thing where it's supposed to darken a lip but it just doesn't like translate I hate that great well I'm getting really pinky by the way it is yeah I don't get that's gonna draw it's gonna transform the lip into a smoky sultry moment the gloss is really pretty like if you just focus on the shine it's too much of oh great here looks like staying kind of oh great alright so let's try to put this over a lipstick yes next test which shade is that I don't know Kitty birthday suit alright that is on okay here we go ready Oh Drake II don't do it ready I don't hate it as much good as the bottom versus the top I mean kinda looks like a new just a new lip color at the same time it looks really smoky and weird I'm not obsessed with it but I don't hate it as much as I did I kind of like it yeah I almost turned to like a little mob oh I like turns things moppy wow it was like a smoke on it okay look now by itself we all know it was a mess but right now let's see the whole mouth no it's supposed to like alter the lipstick it gave it a darker hue obviously yeah okay but let me just keep it real time I wouldn't put on a lipstick and then put on a lipstick to make it darker I would just go find this color exactly 10 million lipsticks out we can get whatever color I'm not someone that does a bunch of layering like I love lip toppers and I love gloss but I wouldn't really put onto the lip six really you know what let me just say it okay I think it's a gimmick gimmicky and I think the blush is pretty not so much but I think this is just a little bit gimmicky oh well I guess there's Laura's final thought all right I think we can sum up our review let's get to it Oh Lord basically summed up the whole video the blush worked for us yes look at you in the monitor it looks really pretty it does look pretty and fleshy and like healthy glow but I think the colors are the same they are honestly I understand like what I at first I was like no this is a little like whatever and then I look back and I have you blend it out you can't tell their friends identical so basically they're selling the same product twice is that smart or horrible yeah I don't think that was this many yeah you a different shades name so lips I think this

star welcome back to my fucking Chang [Laughter] 
what's up everybody welcome back to my Channel today I'm jet-lagged and mommy needs her redbull but besides that we are going to test out some $85 metallic lip glosses I know that price is a ridiculous y'all you know what's up with this channel now I've had a little bit of a rough time with the Christian Louboutin beauty brand on my channel a lot of stuff has not been that great in the past now I will say this like I said in all of my videos that I've used with their stuff I am obsessed with Christian at Louboutin shoes and bags I have a half a million dollars of sneakers in my closet so a lot of people were like girl you're just like throwing shade and my girl I'm obsessed I went to the Christian Louboutin store and France I've had custom-made shoes buy them at the beauty department girl I don't know what's going on hopefully today we're gonna have a better experience and yes we are trying out a metallic lip gloss it is supposed to be high shine and it supposed to be dramatic assist be beautiful and of course we're going to test them out now there are only three shades and there are all different colors so we're going to swatch them today we're going to try them all out on my mouth we're going to do everything that I normally do in a first impressions but besides that you guys life has been so crazy today I actually filmed with Shane Dawson for his Shane and Friends podcast oh my god I live for him who wants to take Shane on my channel let me know that was so much fun so that would be out soon girl I spilled so much gene he like pulled out of me like Oprah I was like man she said that all right besides that if you want to see me test all these crazy lip glosses then keep on watching alright so for $85 you guys let me show you what you get it comes in a gorgeous box like this of course with the logo on the front and if you see on the side it says the name of the colors alright so let's open her up whoo and this is what it looks like now I tested out the normal regular lip glosses months ago on my channel now this of course is the metallic version that just staring at it you can see it looks metallic in the bottle now it comes in this beautiful this becomes her packaging and it has a little like kind of string yarn type of thing and you pull it out and it comes with a little tag on it just says the same brand info on the little card a lot of people last time said this looks like a weapon a lot of you said of butt plug y'all are sick you are sick so it has this beautiful top on it with the spiked ring around it no and not a ring and let's open her up oh my lord sounded like Nathan coming out of me okay so the doe foot is a pointed a little moment like that which is a standard flocking now let's do the smell test okay it does have the same like floral smell as being normal one that doesn't seem as intense maybe I'm a little stuff you guys I've been on three airplanes in a week and my allergies are crazy but um yeah so it's like rosy but I feel like the normal ones were like way more intense you guys know if you watch that video girl so basically let's just keep it real here it says a lip formula with brilliant intense color and a glassy finish to emphasize lip color I'm assuming it means a normal lipstick or my we'll call my original lip color cool so I will test it on myself of course without any product and then maybe the last color I'll put a lipstick on and see what it looks like over because it does say it's supposed to emphasize lip color now it says let's see here y'all it says from new to bright the array of shades are specifically formulated to reflect light and impart brilliant dimension at the end of the day it is just a lip gloss of course it is not going to you know change lives or pay my electricity bills so let's get just watching alright now just like last video at these shade names you guys I am NOT going to pretend and know how to pronounce these or try you know I'm the realest bitch on this YouTube game so we are going to put them right below me right here and this shade is called that's what's called thrust of the P girl alright so this is going to be of course one dis of product I always like to tell you guys how many times I dip in a lot of people show it off camera and I'm a little bit it take you six times or one ho now of course the one a little short but it feels really nice to hold in my hand I love the we're gonna call the applicator alright alright so that is one stiff let me go back in oh one more time okay and then we're going to go in for a third time to finish the rest of my big old mouth all right the color is of course and now on quick note I wish that this part of the applicator was longer or flatter like I just want a little more product on the wand but besides that let me take a good long hard look at this now I'm looking in the monitor and it looks like glass it really does it's like huh it looks really pretty I'm like okay hold up hold up you guys hold up here's the deal it's really pretty it is really pretty but okay I mean I haven't even tried the other two yet but I'm just going to say this right now this looks like it could be a covergirl lip gloss could be Revlon lip gloss it could be really any lip gloss but yeah it's just pretty I love the color I bet you this over like a red or a pink lipstick would be stunning but um okay cool I think it's only fair that we try the other team all right here is the second shade it looks something like this to me it looks like a pinky bronze with a beautiful like gold kind of vibe going on in there and the shade name for this one is right there alright let's watch [Music] so here is the shade fully on the mouth and it is really pretty I almost like it more than the first one just because that glitter looks really nice and the base color is very close to my natural lip color but it's a little more like a bronze hue only thing I'm not living for is when I go sit right in there a little gumminess I don't like embossing to do that it's like oh yes cue alright let's try the last one alright now for the third shade of a lip gloss it looks something like this it looks like a stunning gold bronze color now I did want to test it over a lipstick because it says on the website of course that it looks amazing over a already you know established lip color so at the color I'm wearing today because I know you're all are going to ask it is the creme brulee liquid lipstick from the brand's away cosmetics and if you guys are not aware I have my very own first first-ever discount code for brand and if you use code J star at checkout you do get 15% off and a hundred percent of the proceeds are going to charity and if you don't know about it you can watch my may favorites video which I will link down below I explained everything in there and already you guys in less than a month we have already raised almost twenty thousand dollars for the LGBT Center here in Los Angeles and for the whole organization so you guys are amazing thank you so much for supporting this brand and my code thus far it has been unreal and I didn't know we need to make that much in a year and the fact that it's been like weeks I am like shook so thank you guys so much alright now let's test this lip color over this and liquid licky and let's see what happens now obviously this gloss has a little dark like tench to it which I kind of love how it's making this nude lipstick look let's finish the rest all right you guys this is how the color looks I think over a liquid lip it looks really pretty course it does have that glass like shiny effect they're talking about but I mean that's kind of every lip gloss right I mean obviously some are more shining than others but it does look pretty it's not like getting as gummy as when it's by itself I will say that yeah it doesn't really feel sticky it's a little tacky but not like horrendous or like your lips are stuck together and I feel nice and now I will say this you guys I think it's time to give my final thought all right so let's break it down now the very first review I did in the normal lip glosses the smell is in my mouth it was a very intense these do not do that they smell way less intense than the original formula which thank you Jesus now I will say this of course we're gonna I say this a lot when I do luxury reviews you're of course paying for the stunning packaging you're paying for the name which is a very high-end luxury brand their sneakers start at you know twelve hundred dollars so when you're making a makeup line they're not going to price this drugstore and you guys obviously know that at the end of the day it's a lip gloss like I know I said in the intro it's not going to like you know changes the world but it wasn't so stunning where I was like oh my god I want to use this all the time I'm gonna be a little shady and talk about Chanel new formula of lip glosses they are like mirrors on your mouth and they are like blinding and so stunning and they have no like texture at all these ones you do feel a little bit of something and of course they're the lipstick underneath but um I was hoping for a little more I mean it says metallic and like to me metallic is like metallic we all know what a metallic lip gloss or lipstick looks like I mean they're all in the drugstore Milani has a whole entire metallic line on a soft Beverly Hills has metallic lipglosses these were not metallic in my opinion they were like glossy with some shimmer but I think at the end of the day lip gloss is lip gloss and of course $85 gets you this amazing packaging but the formula was very basic it was basic as let's keep it hood now not saying that this is a horrible experience or like this was the end of the world but I don't think I could approve it just on the basis of light girl it's just a lip gloss opposed to that first one I'm like I honestly feel like you can go to Ulta find a gloss way cheaper and maybe have even a better glossy experience so at the end of the day you know I love this brand but I am NOT impressed you guys I am hoping for the next round of products to have better coverage and a better formula so if anyone is watching that works for that team if you want to Jeffrey star to come help curate call me all right you guys thank you is so much for watching this video I will see you on the next one 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel welcome back to my channel I have loyally in the building today now me and Laura is the four addicts and if the force values brand new crazy pro palates which are insane here we'll hold up a few 128 shaped guides each palette has 28 shape there are three versions oh my god they're huge so today I thought you know what we need to test these out this is way too many shadows to test alone so we're going to test out two of them on our eyes and we're going to do swatches all over lower leaves naked body because when I try you guys are like girl we go we can't see we can't baby here I think I really want to test out this crazy me yeah of course you do and I wouldn't test out this neutral Nellie what oh come on I love the warmth and the cool tone one I mean I'm not a cool tone yeah lover like upset yeah I think it's a cute palette very cute it's a little boy well okay a bit cool tone yeah option but it is a boring palette and like even the pretty gold is in this one so thank you so from someone that has been making makeup for a few years now it's really hard to perfect and slay a neon eye and for someone that reviews a lot of makeup or or does the nails are hard they're very hard and I honestly never expect that much from a neon I don't either but there's a lot we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 neons in this bitch I'm like holy shit okay besides

um of course do not forget to subscribe to my channel well you me you for listening to doesn't headphones I'm sorry are you guys besides that if you want to see if you fucking Sephora bro balls are worth it keep on watching alright so when you buy the Sephora Pro palette it comes in this unit carton like this and on the back it does say all the shade name I liked it it tells you which palette you know I think you and you can see what colors you're going to get you obviously can't see on the outside basically this says create endless looks featuring rich velvety warm pigments and golden textures that light up your eyes so this is the one that lowers about the dress mine has more neons crazy vivid so besides the box which is a nice by the way it is expensive paper in my opinion I comes with this little plastic insert which can I be real with you yeah I love you wash through it but I feel like it's a little Natasha Giannone with the plastic insert it really does okay and no tea no shade you guys when I first saw them I thought it was a Natasha palette which of course no tea no shade Sephora does carry Natasha's line if you're unfamiliar with it me and Laura have used these before yeah they look like this and I was honestly a little shook because let's open this up it comes with a plastic thing that's what just like you know we aren't my thoughts but at least that one says the name oh yeah right but honestly this looks to be side-by-side yeah they're so similar yeah unreal these pens are a little rectangular these a little more we're over here but still it's just the setup at all very very familiar I was like okay girl but hey Sephora carries Natasha so and honestly at the end of the day I know a lot of people read the this brand to self because they are very pensive yes sunset palette that is kind of going viral I mean the other $20 gee this is over 200 by the way so if you're someone that is like this you've got the wrong one you might have a dupe yeah on your hand these are $68 so if you do the math you guys and you divide them up it's like two $42.42 percent shadow which isn't bad at all and hopes that these are good shadows but I mean it's not a bad deal I do want to kind of mention that I mean we did Ally matted eat food but I did wash my hands yeah okay there it is you can talk about the negative mean makeup we get dirty I have moisturizer yeah yeah a lot of our palettes can still see but it is just something to bring attention to yes but I do love the hollow moment here your this goal I like the goal and gets pretty here a heavy winter night I agree it's actually heavier than um let me know I'm the same I would say about the same whoo all right let's do it let's do it all right so I'm just going to quickly pry my lid with a Mac painterly paint-pot like I would normally do I've already done my lids I did soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac so I am ready to go unlike Sena bub oh all right so we're going to kind of do step by step together like all over color transition I increase so what do you what are we going to go in i go in with i like to put a little cream color kind of all over to lighten up eyeshadow primer same so i'm like lots of payoff weight coming out I left it's all out I was great but so I'm going to go on with shade porcelain which is this white one okay definitely powdery oh yeah but doesn't have extreme payoff that's what I want to see so I guess let's try it on camera yeah whoa I would definitely say major pay off so it doesn't has a lot of kick back but they are I mean pigmented this is fucking white like I love putting a fake white down I mean there's a lot of Fallout on here but on the eye it's fun yeah okay what should we do next alright next I'm saying I'm going to go in with this transition shade right here a little bit of a soapy tan color oh my god I mean I might just be bold honestly and you'll say anything I think you should I'm dying to try this formula I'm like does it pink work or not oh that's a lotta kick back obviously you would never hold this up in Riley so it did fall down here I'm just going to die so you're going to kind of go through that I shed a little bit quicker okay I want to see your anyway I do mine oh well all right now I got like this not I gotta try this fucking pink because I'm shook so let's just see how it works oh my god this is good I mean look I don't really think that like fallout is a negative and what palette doesn't have fallout but this is a little extreme yeah alright so the pink actually blended out really nice I took the white shade and I went over it to blend out and I'm like looks like unreal actually besides that I'm ready to keep moving yes so we're going to do next I'm gonna put a little bit of this crazy neon maybe in here yeah that's another Matt I'm gonna actually mix these two together I love mixing a neutral eyeshadow so to get that warm you don't have a fear of is your nail to sliding it huh nice like that one they already ruined I didn't do that you did that didn't really yeah I don't believe me oh this I called Geoffrey in here ah look this spelled your name wrong and puke-green ami Eliza Helen another name that's cute that's really sorry I don't know any of eventually what skin tight we're too skinny okay I'm gonna go in with Amy all right I mix my to addition what just a lot thank you I know it's the same it's the same like when I'm blowing on mine y'all boiling it okay mines blending great yeah look at me ooh pretty yeah I love loving any of you are with a camera I was doing a little extra mess but I will say this though you do got to be really careful because I know the neons are really key is that for a week straight I know and I've literally just opened it all right girl what do we want to try neck I really want to go into this deeper Brown this will be my last Matt no I know I mean how many miles day I've been dying to dip into these purple maybe I have a little unicorn mama underneath my eye so I'm going to be going in with this guy right here and then a little bit of this we're going to mix and match see what they got see if we got some pigment baby oh I'm looking in the monitor now I see it yeah oh yeah okay grow are for you I love it all right China Lee to the shimmer I know I'm feeling very like a little pony you're like vampy smokey so we definitely want to try the metallics what are they actually calling them I think we should probably look at that let's see iridescent textures that empower sophistication so a shimmer eyeshadow I mean basically so we're going to use them dry Laura I'm not to buy it's fucking third colleague I'm giving you that my nose will take you know okay fine that was the planning all right so of course we're going to swatch them all with our fingers and our arms later but right now I mean people wear fucking eye shadow on our eyes right right I like to see what it looks like on the eyes mostly swatches you know whatever your finger but you're on servicing me okay so we can try it dry and then if we're not living we could do 6 plus yes so I'm going to go ahead and try the cranberry color dry and I'm going to try this beautiful glacier color I just have like this feeling internally that that's going to explode with like dust oh great okay it might not hear ya that is pretty for a dry brush yeah yeah tiny bit of follow on your cheek but not the answer I almost want you to wet the basically I want to women I have to wet it because like I don't care if it's like Natasha janela the best eyeshadow or whatever it is I have no wet is it work yeah we all everything I have to do it as well I don't give a fuck how good something is dry I kind of miss a fall out - yes Oh have mercy on myself that just gave it that extra fire yeah that's why I wasn't okay let's try it what's your eye where am I oh yeah no whoa let's see oh Jesus whoa why this is dry you guys okay now it is a little crumbly let's say

shimmer it's pretty blinding it's really pretty no it is a little chunky it's like a little intense yeah it was not going to lie but it works all out yeah there's Paul was intense but it looks pretty uh-huh like a super blinding okay now we are going to quickly put on some mascara off camera and then we're going to come back and do some swatches alright so now that we've played with them on the

do the bronze oh oh I mean in the most pigmented one I've ever done okay that was great yeah let's do clay I love that color pretty whoa let's try ochre whoa that's good that is a pretty yellow really good next to each other I'm kind of living for that I want try Brad holy oh that's stunning looks like this one too uh-huh they're very similar honestly all right let's try chestnut whoa all right let's get a little more like a weird I wouldn't say that the chestnut color no definitely it's like a mommy purple that's a mommy shade this is brown oh my water thank you so and there's nothing on your finger okay ready wait I want it again oh my what happened to that gentleman is the rough setting these two are and it's like fucking but a boo-boo yeah we had to move so let's do coconut shell it's kind of seen formula yeah just see you're gonna show the cute name better oh it's better monkey was a little chunky huh all right sand sand is like a pretty like pearly shimmer okay oh wow real look at this like falling off your skin look oh my god holy okay one more I wanted to try the fucking obsidian boy yeah let's get it you want to know if it's a black big man is good because black shadows are hit or miss for me I certainly are okay right here huh whoa look at that is fuckin came here yeah and look you can even tell that this looks bad wow yeah yeah I know this is stunning brown sugar is a poop yes how do you feel about this watch is well a little in miss but mostly amazing yeah they're mostly really good I know we're all laughing at the last few for you but overall I was a little shook at how well they even finger swatch sometimes you never know yeah and at the end of the day I know everyone at home likes watches but you have to try it and go oh my because you're not wearing out your arm like you bought it for your eyes so let's try it on I I know and I think in this Instagram like YouTube era everyone is like so crazy about the arm watch yeah I think that like when you're buying something in the store you're not going to go like this and go like this and like okay it's going to work great yeah really have to take a brush yeah blend it out and see if it works and at the end of the day these really worked good I think they were amazing they look beautiful super great quality and I think it's a great price for the amount of eyeshadow that you get yes and the packaging is nice it's heavy it feels good now for the pros looks like white approach okay love how highly pigmented they were agree loves how heavy this was love the big mirror in here you know we are here oh we're absolutely loaded questions in there hey the shade of regions is great yeah it really is awesome I like it so let's talk about some of the cons okay obviously they were super powdery the fallout was that's the biggest con to me like that was unreal like the pink definitely went a lot of places yes so that was a little bit of a negative for me they were like super super fallout yeah honestly his whole mirror has like a cast of dust over it because of the amount of fallout so that was a little negative and then I'm just gonna miss my brown sugar it should be taking half a pound I might hoop put that one in there girl what was responsible is every other shame pretty good balance yeah applause so I think for the price they're awesome neon shades are hard to do so - the fallout problem yeah um they look great like my eyes look great your eyes look great they're like BAM like when you put that red on I was like no pretty cool so I approve these what about Jeffrey start a teen Trinity okay all jokes aside these are Jeffrey's are approved I think for the price they're good yeah they're great quality and blend great I mean shadows have kicked back this one was a little extreme so of course if you do own this or you're going to just be a little careful and don't gig like if you're heavy-handed girl you better smoke one before you do your makeup okay all right well I'm excited that these are like a hit yeah same Oh nervous right yeah it was amazing it was amazing so aren't you guys thank you so much for watching is this a video do not forget to

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel hi baby a baby alright so I'm sure you guys have seen our snapchats lately we've been going on a crazy Louie Vuitton spree just a tiny berry just a little one now I've heard of supreme before of course but woman what is that I mean it just it was a really it was a big skateboarding brand back in the day like and it's still pretty icon oh ya know and it's like it was more of your high-end skateboarding brand organic top tier it was like yeah I would say probably one of the top tier for sure cool yeah so when we got this alert on Instagram of a new post we open up our phones and this red and white monogram print was screaming at my face and listen bitch if you have been following me for a while you know I have been collecting a Louis Vuitton for about twelve years now I have so many cool limited-edition pieces thrown over the years we have a crazy closet and vault in our house that requires a fingerprint access and I have a crazy collection so when I saw this stuff I was like oh yeah I couldn't I couldn't believe I was like possessing so pretty ray my MIT I was like wait a minute this is like escape pending company yeah so if you guys don't know this nathan is a skateboarder himself he's been skating for how long like 12 years or so so it's a big part of his life he loved doing it and to start the show of this video is that Louis Vuitton actually collab with supreme on a skateboard with a custom trunk and that's kind of like the star of the show the sickest thing ever we dye it so in today's video we're going to be showing you all the stuff that we got from the collection now if you don't know this the Louis Vuitton and supreme collection is no longer available for some reason they pulled some of the pop-up stores or they might have been like a weird mystery around it and it really isn't in stores so there was pop-up shops like around the world it was like la New York Miami London yeah and then there was supposed to be like a huge in-store thing never showed up didn't happen no but everyone not ordered it like myself and Nate we got all of our stuff which is Hawking awesome so I slightly more of a collector's item now because it's more like more attitude more exclusive it's hard to get very armed right so if you are someone that likes to see some cool you are going to like this video if you do not looking at luxury items and you think that fashion such girls like Manny says right so if people think is crazy new Supreme Hall that's good keep on watching we're going to start off this whole by talking about course clothes they put out some really sick clothes I'm just like in love with this list read Louie print he wears hoodies a lot yeah I'm like a hoodie phonetic and I'm a really big on red so this was just like this is of course is the leather jacket I love it so it's really nicely made like I appreciate good fashion this is really sturdy it feels so warm and cozy I'm like I just want to like maybe be buried in it and because we're so extra we got matching jackets and hoodies now when I buy like this you guys I love the little little details so these buttons on the back of the jacket we're going to try to zoom in here they actually say Louis Vuitton on them it's like everything is custom and I love the detail yes very little detail and the fabric or the inside of the jacket is actually the little Louie print which I have to tattoo to my fingers we're just going to show that off of my fingers what would and then my favorite start of the jacket if I were to turn around is the supreme on the back it's right above your ass alright what's next we'll check out the denim ok like they didn't just do red print they had to go into the denim looks like a baseball like t-shirts have a jersey yeah this Jersey is like that's so sick and just the random supreme print all over it's so sick it looks really cool and then is the denim long jacket I'm not going over makeup on my

get these shoes oh my god they're kind of heavy they are they got like big soles on they do these are like almost democracy platforms but they're like they definitely give you like an inch on them when you wear them but they're really comfy I wore them yesterday I don't like wearing white stuff you guys because I'm so scared of getting it dirty or like even you like go in the car you hit the brakes it's cuffs the side and you're just like and then I guess it's supreme right on the heel in there that's cool and then it looks a little LV right here I think that is so cute all the details kill me okay I don't know this is my favorite piece but it's a second runner-up is the phone case you guys already know I in the Louis Blanc a score so when I saw this one I was like oh I dyed it so these were super limited they're happening to see anyone with it yet no I haven't at all which is wild yeah and then they had to go and make sunglasses now I know for the few pairs there was a black pair that I could not get a hold of your bitch could not get it but these are red ones I died for if you look closely you can see the Louis print on the glasses and it's like almost going to curl it it feels like really futuristic like obviously everything is red when you look through which is so bizarre not bad this looks so weird oh yeah but what I love how they look it looks cool they're very like I don't know going oh what's nice noon well we got a few things for our bedroom we sure did we did in the college do we we got the libertine sex swing you know that was installed last week I wish

and they stitch in this cool piece of leather with the supreme logo on it that looks so cool it's imagined to be like luggage okay so now and we may be getting lit in between takes and guess what YouTube will not allow us to show that anymore okay this is probably some of our favorite pieces as well is the crazy luggage set this is the big ol supreme keep all this is this young bull a little body sling with bobby swings I'm going on a higher that is the cross body this is sick for like this traveling and going to a show right I don't going to and if you have like nice pants on they don't

the inside really sick how many times we're gonna stay safe I don't know it's because it's pretty  sick okay now the star of the show is this beautiful custom trunk I think they literally made maybe like ten of these ever right an entire  world and all crazy Louie is so  cool to me and they allowed us to get our hands I wanted to order it well let me tell the rules the real story is I make so Nathan's birthday's in a few weeks and when they hit me up about this a while ago they were like hey we know Nate loves skateboarding and I was like oh my god this was such a cool like early birthday gift the price is ridiculous but um look we work hard we go play hard no and I think not sound like a douche bag this is like the world's most expensive skateboard because of course you are banker the trunk right let's do a little sneak peek but you guys we actually are going to go to the skate park later and we're going to film Nate trying it out I don't know anything about skateboards so he's going to obviously tell us is it good are the wheels good isn't shitty is it like did Louis kill it or did they let's not kill a lot thank you um so I have no idea we'll check it up what is good or what isn't of course I don't ride skateboards so he's actually gonna write it I'm gonna ride him one time and then we're gonna put it away right so so that would be part two of this video of course that will be coming later this week but I'd like to open it for a second give him a little sneak peek lifted a heavy show you this real quick so Nate gotten his initials and grades on to the luggage it looks so cool open her up all right should we open this bad bitch up let's open her room it's like glowing gold right so of course if you want to see Nate ride the skateboard test it out and go through all the secret compartments that's under it that will be in part two of this video this is a crazy ho definitely one of the what will is one for the book that I want as someone that collects fashion this was just such a cool operation and I think the fact that I'm so into Louie and my man is soda skating it was such a perfect combination really on Cerrillos really created I was like blown away when when I want to showed you this what did you die I was like we were both sitting here thinking like if that fake is that really are they really coming out but you know I mean or you were right no that was I think it's present I probably ever gun oh thanks baby it is time to head to the skate park and let's just this bitch out let's do this alright you guys thank you so much for watching another one of our videos we love you able see you on the next one mwah bye guys see ya 
what's up everybody today I wanted to sit here and turn on the camera and talk to you guys about some really serious subjects some issues that I have been dealing with for a long time and just have a one on one with you guys this video is something that I feel like I owe to my entire audience through the last ten years I have lived my life on social media which is really crazy to think about it's been a really long journey from being a little musician on a little website to my career now and as I sit here I realized that I have a bigger platform sometimes than I realize myself and there are millions of people out there that watch me that know about my life that follow my story and I feel like it's time that I get out a little bit more of my story and this video is mainly about something that is a really fucked up subject that I've had to dealt with for a long time and it concerns old videos that were filmed of me twelve years ago now I want to go on the record and say that I know there's a lot of people out there that love and support me there are millions of you that watch my videos that are out there and that support me but there is also other people out there that do not like me and that's okay if you do not like what I'm about if you hate me if you despise me if you're not into what I'm about you do not need to watch this but I would really appreciate if you could listen to my story and what I have to say with an open mind and I think from human being to human being fuck YouTube fuck all the bullshit fuck the makeup everything that we are so consumed with past all the fun tutorials past everything I want to speak to you as a human being that breathes on this earth with you and lately not lately for the last few years as I have joined the YouTube community I have been definitely subjected to a lot of drama and I get it you know I am a hot topic I have always been outspoken I am you know someone that looks different and I realized that with all of that is going to come the negative obviously the positive is so unreal but the negative can be very very dark and ugly and every time that I get into an online and you know conflict or confrontation or some crazy feud whether it's with my ex best friend or celebrity or other youtubers a lot of stuff from my past constantly gets dragged up it's been happening for years in these videos I say some really disgusting vile nasty and embarrassing things and you know it's fucked up the past can never be erased it is always going to be there and my past has been recorded it's been video it has been exploited all over the internet and I'm sitting here and those videos were twelve years ago and I look at them and I see them resurface and it just makes me sick to my stomach because I don't know who that person was I know who I am today I know exactly the person I am today but I do not know who that person was the person that said those horrible vile things that person was depressed that person was just angry at the world that person felt like they were not accepted that person was seeking attention I was someone that loved to seek attention when I was younger I loved the shock value I love fighting anger with anger and I didn't know any better and does that make it okay absolutely not I want to look everyone in the eyes and let you know that everything that you have seen is so just wrong it's upsetting it's nasty it really makes me sick to my stomach to watch those old videos because what I was saying is not what I represent I think that racism is a very serious subject especially in today's world I'm embarrassed as a person because that is not what I've ever stood for I am all about self-expression self-worth self-love and I think it's also that you guys have to seem not light because I don't ever want that to take away the message that I have always been about so I want to sit here and I have talked about this before on myspace back in the day I have addressed this on snapchat I have talked about this on Twitter in the past but that is not good enough because for everyone out there that supports me that believes in me I owe you the truth and I owe you an apology I am so sorry for my words I am so sorry for everything that I've said in my past I can never turn back time and take those moments away they happened I have owned up with them and I have lived with it for a long time and every time that they get read rag dup it just makes me just sad because I don't know who that person was I think it's really important to share that growing up I I've always been a guy in makeup I started wearing makeup in tenth grade and the world was not how it is today ten years ago there were no guys and makeup on YouTube there was no men and makeup parading the streets there was no people like me and I was very alone and I was also fearless I did not care that the world was not accepting me I knew that I loved makeup I know why I was attracted to makeup I come from a family of chaos alcoholism and abuse and when I discovered makeup that was my happy place I got to go and go playing makeup for hours and escape the horrible reality that was my life and my shitty fucking parents and my crazy upbringing and you know ten years ago when I left the house I wish it was like today I think that people don't realize how it really was and I would leave the house and people would spit on me they would scream faggot at me they would scream freak and they would degrade me every single day and what did I do I fought back with rage and looking back I am 31 years old now and looking back at that person who had just graduated high school who had turn 18 turn 19 and then was just out to the world I was emotionally abused every time but I the house people did not accept me I would be walking down the street people would scream shit out their car every single day I felt like a piece of shit so what did I do I spot back with anger I fought back with rage and it's wrong I want to set an example for the youth and the future in front of me and I want to go on record and let you know that that is not okay just to get someone insults you it is not okay to fight back but sometimes that's how we handle things we're human beings and I think that at the end of the day people forget pass the money the cars the clothes I am just one tiny little person on this earth trying to make a better life for me and my family and I am nowhere near perfect I am literally the furthest thing from perfect I make mistakes every day but I learned from them and the intent behind my words back then it was not about race racism does not live inside of me I don't even know what the fuck like I don't know how that exists into people I said really horrible vicious things back to people to hurt them to harm them to shock them and to let them know that you you're going to call me something I'm going to cut you back so hard and make you feel like a piece of shit because you made me feel low and that is not okay it is not okay to fight words with words like that and I have been subject to a lot of stuff recently the last two years has been so difficult it's also been such a blessing I've never had this much success in my career and all of you out there that have supported me like I will never be able to thank you enough for the gift you have given me but I also think that it's really important to share things and let you know that I'm not perfect I'm wrong all the time you know and even recently when people were saying some fucked up shit to me or trying to you know get a reaction I do give in I am weak I am weak I'm selfish I have anger problems sometimes I lash out when people lash out at me still to this day when someone wants to try me or start something I'm the first one that's like what bitch what you want to try me let's go I've called people stupid I called people rats I'd call people annoying I've called people every in the book when they attack me back because it's hard not to react sometimes and I think that people forget you know maybe once in a while the average person will hear an insult but when you are online the bullying and the extreme hate that can come your way it is really hard to deal with it is hard to log on and every day there are people saying you're great and then there's people telling you you're an AZ message faggot and you look like the fucking horse and you should kill yourself those are things that I have to read every day and mentally process them as okay this is how someone feels about me great can I you know lose sleep every night worrying about it no I can't but I need to learn to just process it and get out my anger some other way and not even respond to people and let's go back to 12 years ago because so many people have heard rumors or they've seen a cliff and they don't see the full spectrum and I am so sorry that any of you ever had to see me like that it makes me want to just I don't know it makes me want to erase myself sometimes I look at that and I'm just like I can't believe I used to be that miserable and that unhappy so I want to let you guys know that I am so sorry for ever saying those things that does not represent anything how I feel that is not who I am and I apologize deep down to the core of my fucking being and that person does not exist anymore I'm all about trying to bring awareness to self-expression and love and I want all of you guys to learn from my mistakes if you take one thing away from this video please do not make the same mistakes that I did and I also want to say that I know that there are millions of people out there there are people watching this right now that are judged by what they believe in by who they are by how they look by the color of their skin and I am just one in a million that has to deal with these type of prejudices every single day so I don't want you to see an old video of me and be like wow Jeffrey says this but he's really about this and it's embarrassing because I don't want it to tarnish what I stand for right now and we have come a long way with human rights we have in the last 10 years you guys it is crazy how life used to be and how it is now but there are still so much there's just so much growth to happen this world is still so dark and miserable and there are so many crazy things happening that I don't know if everyone fully realizes what it is to be different life is too short you guys I cannot spend every day thinking about my past I have moved forward I know what I stand for now and I want to be a better person I want to be a better person from the person I was last week I want to learn and grow and I think that is what's most important for all of us I don't want to deal with anger and rage and drama anymore I just feel like it's just so unhealthy and it eats away at you and whether it's a little online food with a makeup brand or it's with an ex friend or it's with this I'm just tired of feeding into it and I am a victim of that you guys I know I have perpetuated stuff I have fueled fires and it's just wrong and I don't want to continue that behavior I should be setting an example and I have been completely doing the opposite over the last few years and all of this is just I think it's come to a point where this video is necessary not just about me bit but I want everyone to learn from me and my wrongs when you're being attacked or someone is bullying you or hurting you it's okay to defend yourself it's okay to respond but be careful of how you respond because how I handle things was not okay and you never know how it is going to affect another person and I know so many of you deal with this shit on the daily basis but remember what you say to the next stranger could affect them in ways that you do not know you just got to stay strong and realize that hurting someone else back is never going to satisfy I had an empty void all through my early 20s I didn't know who I was I was always angry I never you know I never felt really accepted and I was always alone and if you have those feelings that's okay you will overcome them but it's going to take time and it's going to take a lot of self analyzation and you have to want to change and you have to want to grow I know what I need to work on and fighting with people online and all this bullshit is so unhealthy and it's something that I'm going to completely stop you know I get people that try to get a reaction for me all the time whether they make a video about me whether they talk about my relationship whether they degrade how I look it's hard to process sometimes and like deal with you know and I'm not going to fit into anymore I am NOT going to feed the fire of hate with hate I just think it has to stop you know I don't know what it is over the last three years I just feel like I am on a whole nother level of real happiness I never let myself experience happiness in my early 20s happiness was something that was foreign to me and I don't know whether it's from being in love or being in a relationship or actually achieving all my goals that I ever wanted when I was little but I have never been this happy and I don't want other people and Outsiders to affect my happiness and I have to stop letting them so this is my story this is what I've been wanting to say to you guys for a long time if you are still listening thank you for listening it means something to me that I don't know how to explain I don't want to sit here and try it oh thank you guys so much no but thank you just for listening and hearing me out because you don't have to you can judge me and say fuck him forever and that's okay you're allowed to have whatever thoughts you want but if you are listening to this thank you I love you guys one 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to my channel. Today we are going to do a full face using
only Maybelline drugstore makeup. Now of course you guys all saw my crazy
ass haul from Ulta from earlier this week, so of course, you guys voted,
you guys requested and here it is. And this is kind of like
a first impressions too, because literally,
actually zero products. Oh no, one. Sorry, I've used one product
from this entire crazy haul, the rest I have never
even tried before. So, this is definitely going to be a first
impressions and a full face of Maybelline. I have always kind of like shied away
from drugstore make up on my channel. You guys know I'm a luxury bougie ass bitch
and that's my lane and I like to stay in it. But the drugstore brands are coming
so hard for the luxury brands and they keep on upping their formulas
and just really proving me wrong. I've been very impressed with a lot of stuff
lately, so we're going to do make tutorial. A little soft, I don’t know
if glam is the right word, maybe a little soft
summer little moment. I don't know what we're going to call this look,
but I guess we'll find out in a minute. So, if you want to see me play around
with new makeup keep on watching. All right you guys if you didn't see
my haul I will link it down below, but I got so many products. Now the thing with drugstore and Maybelline,
who has been around for a long time, they have so many formulas. So, it's like okay when I went
to look for foundations you guys, I'm going to be really real with you,
it was overwhelming. I’m going to pick up my bag. There was just so many different formulas,
I really didn't know what to try. I'll be honest, I got the Dream Velvet,
I got the Dream Liquid Mousse, of course you guys all told me to get
the Matte Poreless Fit Me Foundation. So I don't know even
what to do here. I looked at all the formulas and even though
so many people requested for me to use this one, I think the Dream Mousse
is calling my name, the liquid, because it says “Airbrush Finish”
right here and I'm like, “Airbrush, bam!” I mean that's my goal in life. Of course we’ve got
to prime our skin first. So, let's put that down. Now, Maybelline does
have a few primers. We have the Baby Skin and a lot
of you said that one is all right, but the Master Prime, which is a blur
and smoothing, was better. So, I'm going to leave it up to you guys
to not steer me in the wrong direction or we're going to have a problem. So, let's see what she looks like. It doesn’t really have that
much of a fragrance, which you know I like to smell everything
because I’m a fucking weirdo. Alright let's let that dry for a second
and see what happens. I don't think Maybelline makes brushes, if they do I'm so sorry I did not
see any of them at Ulta, but I’m just going to use everything
that I normally use brush wise. I don't really think it affects the application
of makeup honestly. I'm going to just take Classic Ivory
right over here and I don't know what
this is supposed to do, obviously we're going to go in
and see what the hell happens. Alright now I'm going to go in with
shade ten which is the porcelain and I'm going to take this and dot it all over
my forehead and under the eye area and then we're just
going to blend it out. Alright, I'm like shocked at how
much I like this foundation. Let’s see how it lasts and how
other products go on top of it. So, for concealer you guys all said,
“Please get the Instant Age Rewind,” so of course I got it. Now I don't know if this is going
to be light enough for me. I got a few shades this one
is the lightest shade. Okay, so I have a little dome thing,
comes off it looks like a little…oh wow, okay. I guess you, of course,
wind her up. Oh wait, I think I see some
part finally coming out. There we go. C’mon concealer,
I swear to Lord. Alright let's see if this is even
light enough for me. Oh wow, okay. I don't know how you're
supposed to do this, I'm just going to like dot it on
like I normally would do. Oh my god, work. We’re just going to like X
it right on our chin. The tip is really soft. I’m not used to soft tips but hey. Alright now normally I would take beauty
blender and buff out my concealer. So, let's see if this wants
to work with this. Wow, okay you guys I am once again shocked
at how like amazing this is blending out. Now Laura Lee did mention this was kind of
like Shape Tape and then Manny was like, “Girl that's not my favourite, I like one
of their other concealers better.” So, I had like both opinions from my friends
and I’m like well okay they have such different skin types,
I wonder how I'm going to love it. And I'm like it's blending out to perfection,
it's drying amazing, it's not creasy, it's not weird,
it didn't make the foundation weird which sometimes that does happen,
things don't always like go together well but this is like alright,
come on Maybelline. Alright I know they have a setting
powder, so let me find that. We have the Master Fix Setting
and Perfecting Loose Powder. So, I'm going to, of course,
take my damp beauty blender and just dip in there like I normally
would and here we go. Alright concealer is set and I will say this:
that setting powder, okay I see you. Alright now that is done I want
to set my entire face with, of course, powder foundation which I have
been doing since the dawn of time. Now, I don't know what to use because
there is a Fit Me Set and Smooth powder, which looks something like this or we have
the Better Skin Skin Transforming Powder and it says it's a “Super stay”. So, that speaks to me
a little bit more. So, this is a cool flat dome brush
and I’m just going to go in here. Oh come on now. And let’s see what happens here. Alright the entire face is set, it is looking
really airbrushed and really pretty. So, now let's move on to contour. Now this is the only product
that I’ve used before. If you go all the way
back to my channel, one of my first few videos ever it's just
called, “Drug Store makeup tutorial,” I think and I used this Master
Contour Face Contouring kit. Now this one is the, of course,
light to medium and I am just going to use
that contour shade. I already got a different blush,
so I’m going to stay away from that but I think the contour one
is going to be pretty nice. So, let me grab a brush and let's go. Oh wow, okay. C’mon pigment. Alright and now we're going
to do some blush. Now I'm kind of feeling this one
it is called the Medium Coral, it's from the Fit Me collection. They have a lot of Fit Me stuff,
I'm going to assume. This one is just a normal blush
and it opens up like this. I’m just going to take a little
MAC blush brush and let's see if this is going
to look cute on me. Okay, love the colour
of this, really pretty. Alright now they didn't have any crazy
metallic blinding highlighters like powder that I saw. If I missed it, oh my God,
I'm going to be so pissed off. But I did find the Master Strobing
Liquid Illuminating Highlighter and they have the same thing
in a stick, so it's a strobing stick. Probably the same formula but
this is more of a balm type formula. Excuse my hand, I've been swatching
things all morning in the lab. Let's just put this there and see what…
oh wow, I mean it's pretty blinding. It looks like a champagne mirror. Let me try this first. This reminded me of like
a Cover FX Drop. I’m just going to put some on my hand
here, just a little dollop if you will, and then we're going to take
this beauty blender and we're going to buff some on
our cheeks and see if it works. Alright now this shit dries quickly
on the skin and it's a little streaky, but hey I didn't know
it dried that quickly. So, it doesn't look awful
it's really pretty. So, weird using liquid highlighters,
you guys, this is normally not my style. Taking a little bit longer
to finesse into the skin. Obviously, I have layers and layers of foundation
and powder on top so…It’s cute. Alright now for of brows. Oh listen, now for people that
have hair there's brow gels, there is a lot of other products to use,
but for people that have zero hair it's a little more tricky. So, I found the Define a Brow
in shade medium-brown. It looks like this, it has a tiny little
comb which I won't be needing. It is very thin, it reminds me of like
a MAC eyeliner pencil as well. And I usually have put powders or dip brow
type of products like pomades over this. They didn't really have any so I might
use powders but we'll see in a second. So, I’m going to hold my breath a
nd see how this works. Oh lord, these brows have
been trying you guys. Now I don't know what it is
with all these crazy lights but sometimes the brows
do not want to play. When I am by myself, I swear to God,
they're fuckin twins. Today, I don't know. , Now this pencil has
a lot of pigment. It's really tiny, so I’ve had to like
go back and forth a lot. Obviously this is for people to have real hair
and you can really go in and define a brow. When you start from nothing
it is a little more tricky. Right now I'm going to take
some of this contour powder and just kind of run it
through the brows. And it is a little lighter,
which I don't really mind but we're just going to kind of custom
create our own little shade. Alright these brows are as good
as they're going to get. I'm not in love with them,
but it's all good. Okay, time for the eyes. Now for eyeshadow, maybe they have
a lid primer and I definitely did not see that, but I grabbed a lot of eye stuff. Something that I tried on the haul
was these Eye Chromes and they stayed on my hand for a minute,
it was kind of hard to rub off. So, we're going to try
this guy today. What is this shade called? Beige Luster. Okay we're going to try this one and then we've got some of the Tattoo
Colour 24 hour eye cream, I think they're eye shadows they're saying. So, maybe we’ll incorporate that in there
if we can and I then grabbed some palettes. Laura Lee recommended the 24 K Nudes
and then I grab one called the Graffiti Nudes. And this looks like
something like this. Now I don't have a lid primer,
which is scary. Not that I really need one. Back in the day before
they had 20,000 primers in Sephora I used eyeshadow
or a foundation. So, my lids are already primed
 with the foundation from earlier so I am not too worried about it. Alright, I'm going to take this kind of like
banana pale ivory colour right here. Let's see what happens. These pans are small but, hey,
the brush fits in there. So, I’m just going to dust this
all over from brown bone to lid and just give myself a little
highlight under the brow. I really want to use this
one all over the lid. This is just called Eye Chrome. Now this did not come off my hand,
so let's see how it looks on my lid. Okay, I’m not mad at this. It’s is a little harsh right here,
I do want to blend it out. I’m just going to use a brush
with literally no product, so it doesn't get crazy and
let’s see if it wants to blend. Oh yes, it definitely does. Come on mirror. Right now I'm going to go into
this frosty dark brown-ish colour. I’m going to take this and just
kind of put it right over that and just kind of define it more. Oh right, I'm kind of
liking this so far. Now I do want to play with one
of these Colour Tattoos things. So, let me find…
where did that pale one go? Here we go. So, this one is called Too Cool
and it looks something like this. I'm just going to grab a little synthetic
brush and see what happens in here. Alright, I mean it has
pigment on the brush. So, I'm going to just take this right
in my tear duct, in my inner corner, not tear ducts, sorry, inner
corner near the tear duct, and just kind of illuminate
that inner corner. How many times am I going
to say inner corner? I’m going to take it out a little more,
just a little more drama. Alright that inner corner is looking icy. I'm living for it. Now I'm going to take a little shader brush
and what are we going to do here? I don't know what I want
to do for under. I’m just going to do this little greenish
like dark color right here. Let’s just do a little bit
of that on the brush. Let’s see what it looks like. I was hoping that it would look more green,
it literally looks like my lid color, no? Kinda. I don't mind monochromatic but I really
thought it was going to be like green. I mean look at that colour. It’s like a greenish hue but it's
showing up literally  like that one. Alright the eyes are looking smoky. I like how this is turning out. The eye shadows were not like the best
thing on earth, you guys, honestly. Palettes, for me, I like something
that is so easy to blend, full fucking pigment,
this one not loving it. The liquids though and the cream,
like these guys were amazing. Now we're going to do eyeliner. Now I got this a little one
called The Precise Skinny. It's like a gel, I guess, crayon liner. Very thin, like the brow and then also there is
this big one called Color Tattoo 24 Hour. I'm going to try this, I know
it looks a little big but, hey, I've never been
intimidated by size before. Okay, that is not bad. Now this shade is called Audacious Asphalt
and I guess it looks like pure black to me, it doesn’t look grey, really. I mean it's eyeliner, it worked. Alright now for mascara
we are going to go in with the Colossal Big Shot
Volume Express mascara. I love this gold component. Now the wand looks something like this
and let's see how it looks on these lashes. Alright mascara is done. I love the bottom lashes. Obviously don't really wear bottom falsies
a lot and the bottom ones are like bangin’. So, okay Big Shot I see you. Alright you guys we're
almost to the finish line. Now I don't want to do
any false lashes. I don’t even know if Maybelline has
lashes, I saw none on the display. And I mean drugstore looks, for me,
are always mascara friendly. Now I do want to do,
of course, a lip. So, let's do a lip liner. This is in shade Totally Toffee. And then we're going to
pair it up with a nude lip. Oh my God, I got a literally
every nude on the rack and I think I'm going
to do 535 Purely Nude. We’ll try that out and see if
I can look like a porn star. Alright you guys my wrist hurts. This lip liner, I don't like how
slim it is that the tip, it's a little hard to
like really do it fast. Like a MAC lip liner is like a way easier
and thicker, it's what I'm used to. So, I'm like over here like,
“Girl I'm going to get carpal tunnel.” The shade though is really pretty, I'm just like fuck man this is like
a lot of work for a liner. Alright, now let's take
Purely Nude lipstick. Is this is going to be too light? We’ll see in a second. Oh my God, yes. This is like my 90s nude lip fantasy. And then of course to blend it all out
we're going to go back in with a lip liner so we don't look like a crazy person. If you don't want to do it this nude
of a lip, you definitely don't have to. I love this look, it’s very ombre. This liner though, girl. Alright the last step you guys
is of course a setting spray and I found the Master Fix
Wear Boosting spray. It’s supposed to lock in makeup
and have a long lasting finish. So, do we supposed to shake this? “Helps prevent makeup melting and
color fading. Application: shake well.” That’s all I needed to hear. “Avoid spraying directly
into eyes and lips,” don't they mean mouth, I mean? Let’s see what happens. It comes out you guys, look at
my mirror it's like raining on it. Okay c’mon face. Oh, my face doesn't look wet though,
which I'm kind of shocked. Like usually, like with a MAC
Fix Plus, you can see it. Let me scoot back I might
want some more. Alright, this look is complete. Alright you guys this is, of course, what we've created with all
of the Maybelline products. Now I will say this: I'm shocked
in the best way possible because I'm going
to give these products, now obviously I have not
tried the full entire line, but from what I’ve tried today,
most of it was actually amazing. So, we've been sitting here on camera
now well you guys been watching this for what 10-15 minutes. but you know,
on the other end I've been here for about an hour,
you know I like to take a smoke break, I took a drink break. Code Red Mountain Dew,
I swear to God. And let me just go
from start to finish. Let me just say this: the primer,
I think was actually amazing. Bitch what pores? What pores? That might be one of my favorite things
from this look because my skin, I love how it looks,
I'm looking in the mirror. I love it I think the contour powder
was great, highlight was patchy. I'm not living for it, I think the more the look
 like came together it's looking nice, definitely does not come off. The eye shadow, I think,
was really cute. The only thing I did not love
was the brow pencil. I wish I would have
gotten a lighter shade. It was a little harsh for me. I don't mind it now that everything's
done and the eyes are smoky but I wish I would have gotten a lighter
shade or maybe a pink lip liner for fun. Now I will say this: the mascara was good,
the lip liner I really didn't like that, I don't know why, that’s like
my least favorite thing. I just don't like how small it was
and it got kind of weird down here, like dark and not blending. The actual lipsticks themselves,
I swatched more off camera on my hand. They are creamy and amazing
and I love how this lip looks. I think it turned out really cool. So, is Jeffrey Starr approving Maybelline? I am. So, this tutorial was really fun to do. Also the blush was really cute,
I mean the eye stuff was great. So, the only thing that was a flop
for me really was the shadow palettes. I think they could definitely work on those,
but most of the stuff was banging and I'm a little shook by it. I will say that. I'm always shocked when
drugstore stuff comes through because I've had a lot of bad
experiences in the past. But Maybelline, I see you girl! Now I will say this: the lip liner didn’t love it
and maybe they have another formula, I will try that later,
but it was not for me. But everything else came
together amazing. I like still can’t get
over the foundation. I'm like, “What the fuck is in this?” I'm going to go Google
the ingredients later because I'm like really surprised
and I can't wait to wear it again. So, thank you guys so much
for requesting this video first off and of course for watching it. I had a lot of fun filming this today,
so I will see you guys in a few weeks. Well, no I will see you in a few
days for another video but I am doing the full face using only NYX

you so that is it are you guys excited because I am alright guys besides that let's dive into a sweat in a Wilder view and see what the hell is going on alright now we all know that the drugstore brands have been really coming hard lately in the last six months of 2017 I was a little shocked at how aggressive they came with packaging from the formulas being a lot better like listen I've said this before in videos but if you're new here I have been doing makeup for 15 years and wet and wild and a lot of drugstore brands back in the day when I was first doing makeup in like eighth and ninth grade the formulas were a little low but girl I am proud of wet and wild and I hope that they continue we don't know what's in here of course but I hope they continue their greatness because they're mermaid collection last year so late and I was actually really shocked because this brand is so affordable so do we know what is inside here today no but we're gonna test it all and see what the hell happens let's show off the box let's give you guys a whole little rundown and let me tell you what this collection is about so here we are the box is open now wet and wild is calling this a new era of goth where dark meets light moody meets bright this is not your mother's goth meet Gotha graphic a world where unicorns have perished but they're holographic shadows remain resulting in an unexpectedly bold color statement pastels are offset with a bright pop and skulls glow with holographic dimension girl whoever wrote that work I do love the theme I love the white and wild is playing on the whole unicorn trend they actually did their own unicorn thing last year and brands are still making unicorn stuff now and I think most of you if there's a few of you out there who are grilling and grappling onto unicorns that's alright but most of us were over it okay thank you so this is actually a really cool idea love the theme now the first thing I want to try out because I'm looking at my face in the monitor yes I have foundation on contour blush concealer I need a highlight on so before I do any lip swatches or anything on the eyes we are going to test out all three formulas today I'm like damn girl wet and wild I'm also in the press release I love how it said this is not your mother's golf first of all ten years ago in high school I was gothic insert picture here and insert picture here yes that's exactly how I used to look black lipstick spiky hair and actually won best hair in the yearbook don't hate me let's dive into this review this is the Wet n Wild moon tears loose highlighting powder now just from looking in the jar you guys can see it looks blinding in there so I'm kind of like alright and now a little bit about this product you guys let me tell you the Realty this is only $6.99 holy that's cheap and amazing now this is cruelty free gluten free fragrance free and this is a vegan shade it's buildable it's shimmery it's a powder perfect for face and body contains nylon oh girl like pantyhose or what are we talking here contains nylon to help promote blend ability and impart an elegant silky texture I'm not mad at it let's give it a try for $6.99 girl I'm like shook all right now a cool thing is hold on look at that that is really cute I love that it says peel here now my real nails are growing along you guys I know bitch needs a fill right we got the sticker off here we go I'm just gonna literally tap some on my hand right here oh oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I'm like buildable bitch that's a mirror okay okay this was really soft the texture is smooth it's not gritty oh my didn't explode in my face thank God I have asthma oh I'm getting a call from my lawyer girl one second I might be getting sued or extorted right now whoa all right we're in the clear it's actually something exciting I'm working on a big collaboration with someone but what did I happen to that later all right you guys so first of all first impressions this highlighter is really cute are we living for the little mirror effect cuz I am so this is for face and body I love it there's a lot of other highlighters in here so I don't want to rub it all over my face I'm gonna take a little bit just put it right here uh-huh uh-huh and yes we're gonna blend it we're gonna blend it I just want to look like a beacon for a second oh I like it it is kind of more subtle all right so so far is so good moon tears appears to be really cute all right next is the mega glow highlighting stick and what is a shade called hell Oh darkness alright it looks something like this love all the skulls on the packaging just from looking at it this almost looks like a milk makeup they're holographic stick so this guy is $6.99 as well it's packed with multi-dimensional pearl pigments this highlighting stick will give you an intense glow alright so they're claiming that it is going to be intense so I guess we're just gonna give this a whirl when you open it up okay so it comes very protected I love that Oh Q it's literally a top you can put back on so you don't damage it when you travel I'm going to assume so we're just going to scoot that up I'm just gonna take it and put it directly on my skin alright I mean there's really only two ways to apply it you take it with a brush or a sponge and you apply or you can just go directly on the face let me get it warmed up on my hand here oh okay so it does have that really pretty iridescent it does look very bright it doesn't feel too sticky it doesn't feel too tacky I mean you got it's blending out really cute okay well I'm just gonna apply it directly to my skin so let's see what happens here oh girl all right now you can literally just take your finger and I'm just gonna Pat it in now we do have a lot of powder and foundation on so you never know how it's going to interact with what's you know under the product so this will be a good little test oh wow that really does look really pretty it's like angelic alright girl I'm like for $6.99 I think this is one of the best stick highlighters I've used on my channel a lot of the times you try to blend it out and it like wipes off your foundation or it looks streaky and weird and this one it looks cute so I'm just gonna keep that on I'm just gonna put a powder over it for fun so let's move on they have more highlighters I'm like gosh alright so let's move on to another highlighter I'm like damn how many formulas can you all do so we have the highlighting powder the mega glow highlighting powder if you will and I have talked about these on my channel several times throughout the last year and they keep putting out more shades which thank God because these actually really work so when you open it up it does have a skull imprint this shade is its limited edition it is called white Raven $4.99 I think I forgot about you P's were I know it's kind of cheating to put it over the cream it's gonna really be crazy but I just feel naked first of all let's do a little finger swatch ooh oh wow it literally is like a powder version of the cream that's on my skin I'm just gonna take this right here and do a little BAM well first of all let's take it with a fan brush let's dust around I'm just gonna put it directly over this one shall we Oh bitch you see that you see how that looks a contour my contour needs to like go to bed you're dismissed contour no one cares about you anymore honey Oh oh my god I want to like put this on my brow bone I want to put this on my everything Wow okay let's move on to the next shade so the next shade is called purple ashes and it looks like this it's like a pinky duochrome type of thing the undertone is like a violet purple let's take a clean finger here and let's see what happens oh it looks like this kinda hard to tell let's do it right next to the other one sorry I'm not flipping you guys off BAM oh wow it's very eat the roll and iridescent it's different definitely better for medium or darker skin tones and it does have a little fine Mica's of glitter if you guys can see that in there let's just try it on my other cheek I got no highlighter over here let's dab into here [Music] mm-hmm it's subtle obviously you guys can see it's subtle but I'm not minding it it's like pretty I'm also gonna take a little bit of this and just do it on my Cupid's bow see if we can get some glowing going on there oh yeah it's subtle I mean I'm looking over here like so this is really not for me I think it's cute I would wear if I was wearing not a lot of makeup and probably just like little bronzer a little highlight but it is pretty it's just not my favorite all right so we have the highlighting section from the Gotha graphic collection out of the way now we are going to dive into some eye stuff whoa what the hell are these these are okay let's hold them up so these are the mega last liquid cat suit liquid eye shadow this is gonna give your eyes a holographic edge with this high-impact liquid glitter shadow features pearl pigments which combine for a multi color shimmer effect these are only $4.99 each there are four shades of course like I mentioned let's put a few of my eyes I mean hi I literally have nothing going on here except some primer the only thing I don't like about drugstore brands is sometimes the packaging you know if anyone has any sort of nail length peeling all this stuff off I'm like girl this shade is called pure intention and I'm just gonna put it on my lid first of all the packaging feels sturdy I like it it's cute nothing like mind-blowing but it is cute okay so this is what the DOE foot looks like it is flat probably easier to see it against my backdrop sorry let's just take a little bit and see what happens oh so it went on super easy feels a little cooling it isn't like yeah this was a little wet it's a very extraterrestrial I want to like throw on some mascara and that's it maybe like a dark lip and I'm just like wow we're trying a different one alright so this one is mystic dreamer and this one looks like this it's more of like a pinky silver Toddlers and Tiaras like I'm gonna cut your head off moment let me just see what happens over here guys okay okay oh oh how are we feeling this one definitely has a little bit of like that pinky undertone that I love but the base looks very similar to this one okay let's swatch the other two I know this one is called goth tears I love that name is a very more like blueish purple very dreamy I'm just gonna take a little bit of this you guys ready for this let's just really take it there are we gonna go we'd go in there we're going there whoa this is very duochrome E and I'm kind of here for it like she would do a wing do we pull it out or we're just gonna take it there and just like say it whoa okay kind of living for this not bad this shade is called Nick doe philia and if you're wondering what the that means it means someone that loves being in the dark or the darkness I'm running out of space here everybody so I'm just gonna do a little swatch right here in my hand it's a hand swatch channel BAM oh this one has a darker base imagine putting that over like a black shadow or something gray or like even a liner cute it definitely needs to go over something as you guys can you guys can see it's a little streaky right there but definitely put it over something if you want it to pop but the other ones by themselves are stunning I love how they look definitely give you that really cool dimension and in person they're very eye-catching like when I'm looking in the mirror right here I'm like I just can't stop staring at it so okay not bad I live for it let's move on all right now I'm gonna do a little bit of mascara so I don't look crazy I need a little bit of like Vavoom here please oh hey what you doing baby oh my god this hi hi you want some I'm good just doing a little wet and wild review what do you think about this highlighter it's wild it's blinding it's like crazy florescent what about this underneath that blue is intense it's cool on its really pretty it's like blue uh-huh reminds me of like some ocean stuff isn't right I look like a mermaid II yeah what's the queen of mermaids called it's got some lips to do and then we'll go on a date yeah all right that Cupid's bow dou ah that's cute huh let's dive into some liquid lipsticks now there are four shades here oh it's like a grey we got rose gold we got this crazy blue with glitter so these are all metallics so we got four metallic liquid lips these are $4.99 and let's just starts watching them I think we need to go with this one first or you give me so like just look at that color looks like there's glitter in there the shade is called pastel grunge and let's open her up and see what happens oh wow I mean I'm down to wear these colors but girl okay y'all see that it's a law chunky you know sometimes when you pull something out for the first time it could be a little weird so we're gonna give this a second go let me just stir it up in there okay let's try that again [Music] girl okay this blue one is a little stray key not living for it yet mmm okay this shade is a note for me let's wipe it off and try another one my lips are a little dry so I'm gonna put on some of my own lip scrub this is blue raspberry sucker and girl we need to exfoliate this melt alright let's move on let's try wicked pink it looks like a little rose gold ma vie baby pink moment and okay looks a little more smoother on the applicator let's give it a whirl girl Wow wild are you playing me did you just come so hard with all these damn highlighters and the liquid lips are not hitting what is going on or I'm taking the wand I'm stirring start one more time uh-uh it's just like this is not it I'm like is this a lip topper no this Lily says metallic liquid lipstick I'm like are y'all seeing what I'm seeing it's like barely there I can literally still see my real lip color underneath like what happened where the pigment go let's try the third shade this is a metallic grey as you can see it is cold I'm looking I'm that person gunmetal heart alright I swear to God if this one don't work I'm coming for blood my lips like rejecting this today I'm literally gonna put this on my hand I mean mama that is sheer it's just the payoff on these are not great I'm like am I like delusional or what first of all this is like not a girl yeah they're all right on my hand but it's still streaky and it's like this would actually be really pretty is like eye shadow but the lips are not hitting all right you guys I am sadly disappointed in these metallic liquid lips usually wet in a wild can kill it with their matte liquid lipstick formula but these ones are just really not hidden so let's move on to the eyeliner that's rough it is a rough dark world out there now we are moving on to the liquid eyeliners there are three shades my OCD is let go over here these are of course limited edition as well these are metallic liquid eyeliners featuring pearl pigments which combined for a multicolored shimmer effect and it's supposed to have a punch of color with high impact we'll see about that shall we let's go into the first one scull prayer it looks something like this I don't really use their liquid liners much but I'm down to give it a whirl this is what the applicator looks like very thin and let's zoom in on my hand and has been swatch to filth today oh okay letting bad of course it was a little streaky but hey when you finesse it into the skin that is definitely a metallic like pearl white liner so I haven't definitely not mad at that moving on let's try the next one this one is called pink coffin I wish this was a matte pink eyeliner that would be sickening but let's see what the metallic looks like if we really don't do metallic pink liners but I'm here for it the tones alright it's a little kind of like milky and sheer like I'm not really getting that much metallic it's like uh I wish it would've been a lot better because obviously pink is not just my favorite color it's my life so wet in a wild I'm a little mad at you right now this next one what is this one called black butterfly see I wish it was that color purple like a matte purple liner would be sick let's give this a whirl this is what this one looks like oh wow yeah these are not bangin the white one actually works that these two are like just to sheer and I really don't think they are going to look a snap honey I so those are kind of like for me but looking down on my table I have now swatched and tried everything in the entire collection so let's give our final thoughts no shocker here the star of the show was this highlight combination I've stared at myself in the monitor for about an hour now I'm tired and he knew NAB okay but for real this Plus this equals ah and I really recommend these two I love them together yeah the one of course I said was a little more subtle and not my cup of tea but it is pretty I'm over here looking at her like okay she bad so this one is cute now I'm moving on to the loose highlighter I think it's really cute you can honestly take this rub it all over your body and ready for a glow you can mix it in with lotion and give your body an extra little shimmer so I definitely think for the price this is awesome kinda reminds me of an old Mac powder that looks like this so for this price point girl to natch this one up now what else are we gonna dive into girl I'm looking down like I lived for the liquid eye shadow like look at how that stayed it just looks pretty like I don't know giving me very like Coachella just pretty vibes I really love these they're awesome I hope that they come out with more colors because I am here for it now moving on to what I was not into I am really shocked that these metallic lips flopped this hard usually they come a little harder and they are a lot more blendable but the pigment weird it's just not here and I'm not sure what happened they look so pretty in the vials but they were just not it for me now moving on to the liquid eyeliners the pearl one was the only one that really stood out to me you guys saw this in the close-up no not happening these did not work they were too streaky and they're just not it but this one was actually really cool so we're gonna have to try this out in a future video but that is the entire gough the graphic collection sound off below what do you guys think what did you guys like on me what did you hate I want to know your feedback and of course do not forget to enter my giveaway all right you guys I had a lot of fun today I love playing with makeup I love shine things and I love how this turned out this I can't stop staring at it alright you guys thank you so much for watching today's video I will see you guys on the next one bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel Tuesday do you guys do you guys like that noise let's try it again alright you guys so today we are going to dive in and try allegedly one of the world's scariest craziest weirdest mascaras I saw this floating around the internet and I might be legally blind after we're done with this review we'll see but um alright before we dive into the review I just closed the won and now it's something really exciting I know a lot of you know that my brand and me make merchandise but on jeffree star cosmetics calm I just launched all brand new fall merchandise I have brand new members only JSC jackets they look something like this of course we got the beautiful embroidery with the pink buttons and stitching and look at the back boom I've been wearing these a few times in my videos this last few weeks and I've been getting so many comments about them so they are finally online we got black we got hot pink which might be my favorite and then we also got the baby pink this is the jacket that nate is wearing in the new star family collection beauty campaign ads all over the internet and we got a bunch of new t-shirts we have new colorways because you guys sold out of the last run like so fast my head was spinning so I made a bunch of different colors for everyone that was like you know what Tyra is not for me we want regular colors as well so we got the black jeffree star approved shirts and there's a bunch of colors so hop online I will link it down below in the description box but anyway enough self plugging let's get into this damn review today everybody we are reviewing the new Avon mega effects mascara now I'm sure a lot of you are probably sitting at home right now going hey Vaughn Jeffery really listen Avon is a classic staple in my grandma's makeup I'll give you that I have never reviewed an Avon product on my channel before you know me I'm always brutally honest it's just not for me like the brand does not speak to me not really my thing now of course if you are younger and have no idea about Avon basically they used to have a bunch of women all over America maybe the world I'm not sure that would show up at your doorstep with samples this is the old days okay we're talking like I don't know 70s 80s maybe I should google it and fact check myself but anyway um women would show up at your door and say hey you want to try these samples and then you would order the full size and they would ship it to your house or drop it off I've never really seen people review Avon ever on YouTube it's obviously not Instagram friendly but it's a weird one because when I saw this online I was like now I got this on Amazon for literally $4.99 it's a little weird because it says $4.99 on here but then it says that used to be $10 plus 399 shipping amazon prime what the hell is going on alright so let's open this up because you guys are probably gonna feel a little weird about this just like I did so it comes in this unit carton right here on the box it says that it is 0.317 ounces 307 what's the benefit 10.3 okay so it's literally almost the same amount as a roller lash a tiny bit more okay so here we go yes this is a mascara everybody when I saw this I was like I don't get it we're about to try this out so the mascara comes like this and we're gonna try to open it right now so basically you are supposed to squeeze see those little side ridges right here you were supposed to squeeze them I think and then pop it open I'm not sure why don't we read it before we up my nails so on the box it says grip sides and rock mascara brush side to side okay and then it says see inside of carton to rock a breakthrough lash look okay to safeguard purity never lend or borrow your mascara discard after three months of opening never add water or so we're gonna zoom in right here because I don't know if a lot of you are gonna believe me but this literally says right above my nail never add water or saliva I'm sorry I'm like bitch if someone really spitting in their mascara or licking the wand what the are some of you guys doing out there well today we're not gonna be spitting because we all know we swallow in this house alrighty so besides that open here for instructions on how to rock a break ok so it has these weird little arrows here I guess we're gonna peel this back oh wow this is the weirdest packaging okay oh okay there's a little instruction book in here grip head sides and remove cap Bend brush to desired angle and apply from root to tip all right baby let's open this damn thing up so of course as you guys can see I have my makeup all on except mascara so if I look like a little alien right now that's why alright so we are going to hold this down like it said and I'm gonna hit myself in the face okay so here's the cap and here is this weird contraption alright so then it says Rock brush from side to side and pull out my god this is the weirdest thing oh I see you literally have to start let me move my hands everybody sorry about that so you literally have to whoa okay let's pull it out for the first time and see what the hell is going on oh my god alright we're going to zoom in on this crazy thing let's sorry my backdrop is a little dark so this is the bristles it literally looks like 10,000 tiny spikes that are ready to attack almost looks really clumpy okay I'm the weird one that's just gonna attach it with my fingers because I'm a little scared here hmmm oh look that they go side to side ah that is so weird I've never seen a mascara like this before okay so clearly we all want to know if it works we are about to find out so then it says you guys literally bend and brush so it's literally looking like the picture is like this it's like a just like that and you're supposed to go up in your lashes wow this is really weird okay first of all let's wipe off my finger before I get mascara all over the place lord help me out also real quickly before we try it I did find a little tidbit online about this this says that this breakthrough mascara provides 24-hour volume leading lashes darker dense and more dramatic get ready for a corner to corner lash transformation with our first ever wonder brush it bends and adjust to multiple angles capturing every lash top to bottom okay we're enough talking give me a mirror let's see if this works okay so clearly we have none on here no eyelash primer nothing we're going in straight okay I mean there's only one way to try it it's to go full force we're gonna zoom in and let's see what happens [Music] okay okay we're going in whoa okay I got a little bit of mascara on my lid of course this is my first time using this so it's a little weird oh my god this is a weirdest feeling okay I'm shaking my lashes back and forth and I'm combing it through you let me add a little bit more and just go through the lashes with one more time I'm not holding my breath I'm sweating let me dunk in and we are going to do the bottom oh my god that is that sounds scary all right so it's in there we're gonna rock it back side to side and here it is again coated okay let's do the bottom [Music] okay mommy's a little like whoa taken aback by this let's put this back in here now we're gonna let this dry for a second all right you guys so here is the Avon mascara side of course and here is literally nothing so I'm just going to do a slow little head turn if you will and let's see the difference [Music] shockingly enough oh sorry about that it worked okay so this mascara actually worked I'm sitting here like that was the weirdest brush I've ever seen even this Hey it's like a limp dick girl I'm like Hello what happened you drank too much okay so let's keep it hood here the top lashes um they look pretty like we all can't why let's talk about the bottom lashes they look great they really look nice do I like them little thicker yes but that means you would probably go in with another coat Wow like comparative this actually works so I'm sitting here like do I do the other side or do we try it against my favorite mascara and see the difference because it's gonna be really hard for me to stop using benefit if this one's better but I don't know if it is so let's do a little mascara battle in the middle of this video and see if there is a big difference this cap is a very awkward okay so let's go in with the roller lash and let's see what it looks like [Music] [Music] here is the benefit roller lash versus the Avon so we got Avon over here and we got roller lash from benefit over here let me look in the zoom in camera and you guys can tell me if there is a difference all right so right off the bat I'm gonna say it I of course am a conventional person sometimes I don't like when certain products are turn weird or there's a different version like you know mascara is mascara we all know there's crazy wands and brushes out there but I definitely think that this wand performed better than this crazy contraption no I will say this lets disk into our review right now first impressions is that this side does look pretty there's no denying it I like it I think it's cool but then when you hop on over here the bottoms do look very similar this one looks a little more I guess spidery and then this one looks a little more no I don't know I guess a normal but to me this top looks more flawless it's more full it's more dramatic and then this over here they look a little more fine combed fine-tooth comb because of the brush but kind of like this side better for me now of course if you're gonna work fake lashes it don't matter what mascara you use because it's gonna be hidden anyway but if you were someone that wants a cute little moment and you want to try something that's literally only $4.99 girl get this cuz it's weird if you're someone that's like girl thank you so much but I'm gonna stick to what I know then you know you're good but I think when a product is like Laura Lee says gimmicky then you know and if it's affordable give it for fun and if you're not into it you're not into it but this mascara definitely worked so I will say just because I like benefit more it doesn't mean this isn't cool so we are gonna give the Avon mega effects mascara the Jeffrey star stamp of approval because y'all know it worked as you saw on camera it's cute like there's no denying it will I reach for it every single day probably not will I use it again yes because we know when I buy something on my girl we gotta use it a few more times so I actually liked how it made the bottom so maybe I will try it in a tutorial coming up I'm a little shocked at that weird ass brush and its performance like bitch you worked oh right you guys obviously the reviews over and the mascara worked but besides that I just want to say thank you so much for watching this review and for being so supportive I mean this year is I can't leave some ass over we're getting it October and I just can't believe how quickly 2017 is flying and bye I know this is random but it's just been such a magical journey and I'm just really happy to be here on YouTube sorry for this little weird sappy moment but I just wanted to say I love you guys I appreciate you and I will see you on the next video mwah bye guys 
what's the help everybody welcome back to my channel today I brought Nathan here hi baby hi baby what are we going to do today we're going to try some face masks some weird as fuck face mask yeah I would say so now Nathan's skin you guys has improved tremendously since we've met and I know a lot of you have shared your thoughts on that you're like what's his secret we want to remind you that me and Nathan we are regular human beings well I don't know if I am and I'm like an alien cyborg happens whenever you shave your face so Nate just one baby face yeah every time I shave you always unveil whatever's underneath alike a little scruff so it usually gets a little sweaty and stays there and then it yeah so he does get breakout he is a normal dude so right now he does have a little breakout you know no kind of little crazy pimple appear it's finally going away y'all know about about that skin I'm not I'm not perfect either I've had my moments but I'll get that little constellation going on alright so today we're going to try out two types of masks one has been going viral for a year all over YouTube everywhere their mother has reviewed it except us so what's up so what are we going to try out today we're gonna try out this carbonated bubble claim mask yes now I know this was really big a few months ago and now viral on Facebook again we're gonna talk about that one in a minute we have to google the instructions because it's all in other language yes definitely not English and today I am going to be trying a brand new mask from Tasha you guys of course are familiar with Tantra because I had a dowsed of my entire face over and over and over with their luminous dewy skin mist I am such a fan of this setting spray skin refresher it's very nice it's amazing a little pricey this brand is very pricey but it is amazing and it works and that's what I like but does this mask work we had no idea we do not so I am going to be trying out the violent sea radiance mask look at this jar not that's a cool color it's stunning and it came in this beautiful box the ombre that looks like this it's like very all like satin and cute I love it I always have cool packaging move Johanna now this one oh my lord so we're going to talk about both obviously they're very different from different brands and how much is here is baby this one is $12 now this one is a hefty $68 you know Tasha they're bougie and I fuckin lead for it so we'll see if mrs. worth the price most of the time their stuff works - it really does this one says that we have to leave it on for like 15 to 20 minutes Nate is only five minutes you'll lift this put on mine first yeah and let's see what happens then when mines on we can do yours okay so mine is a creamy anti-aging mask pack with brightening Japanese beauty berry and dual vitamin C to reveal a brighter softer skin so two types of vitamin C will provide an instant glow and an antioxidant protection from UV damage for a continued writer skin over time I'm down for that because Sun I don't like you so this mask is for all skin types which is pretty cool I love that so it says after cleansing apply a generous even layer to the skin avoiding the eye area leave on for 15 to 20 minutes and then rinse with warm water all right it also came with this really cute talk show it's called the essence this is like a little travel size normally it comes in a big bottle and it says use first before the mask for a better result so I'm just going to take a little cotton circle from CVS you already know and let's put this all over so I will just wipe around my face to get all the dirt off look how much I wear a lot of makeup last night so it's like and Nate has already prepped his skin with this Sicily rose toner alright so let's open this up and see what it looks like oh wow look at the color it's such a cool thing yeah it's like so cool it's like a literally like a violet lavender and oh my god so so good yummy I'm like hmm okay so you're literally just supposed to take it with your hands of course look at these nails y'all I'm not trying to get these nails fucked up and oh let's just see what happened so it says apply a thick even layer - no it's so cool I'm kind of like in love with this color [Music] all right you guys the mask is on my skin and now it smells amazing it feels I don't wanna say cooling because it doesn't like the freezer face or anything but it definitely has like a little cool to the touch it feels really nice on the skin I love the color it's fucking cool oh my god my hair this color right okay let me wipe my hands off now Nate let's open up yours baby Ryan baby now I'm going to Google this you guys because literally if you see on the box the ingredients the instructions everything is in a different language but if this is from the brand Becca milky Pig this is like the same brand that we did the magnetic face mask oh really for $12 you do get a lot of product yeah you doesn't do I can't even see the ounces on here you guys because it's in another language so let me google it and I also wanted to note on the talk-show one you guys you do get a lot of product obviously you guys see I use a lot on my face and there's still a whole lot in there there's a huge tub there so it didn't use a lot of products alright baby so this is going to let's see here what is it supposed to do blackhead removal suitable for all skin types of collagen green tea charcoal clay mask okay so basically this is supposed to take out all your in purity so you're just going to take a lot with the spatula alright so it says to put a hefty amount on your whole entire face leave on for three to five minutes and when the bubbles have blown up absolutely do a foam massage with a little tippet water and wash away all right so let's have you start coating your face alright so I'm just going to help him out oh my god ready kind of like bubbling in here from being out in the open holy shit so basically the warning on the box said do not eat okay it's good to know uh-huh spatula you guys is really little I don't like it I wish it would have distributed the product like a larger amount but whoa I can hear it like sizzling almost like soda pop like I might to a different face brush you guys because this is taking so long hold that alright so I'm going to take this brush I would put my primer on with and hopefully that will distribute it a lot quicker there we go yeah the brush it comes with you guys with that little spatula thing is shitty we got it the Grilli bubble yeah I know it's like almost like tickling my face from bubbling really yeah I like want to itch it a little bit no new me it's like you try to put more on them the bubbles are like getting crazy I'm going to avoid the eye area of course as always it's hard when it starts foaming you guys to get it to like adhere to the skin oh my god oh my god you're bubbling like an old little man okay so we're but we're about two minutes in and it looks like a cloud sat on Nate's face yeah it's hard to move your face no I mean I can't really breathe through my nose or I'll like start to suck it into my nose really mine feels really good it's like very normal obviously yours is bubbling like crazy market starting to like fall off my face no it's not I know I got a heavy like big no no it feels like it's starting to like drizzle almost oh no it's not oh my god it's like the foam on top of a soda like would you touch it that is so weird I could just see it in my peripherals and everything I call my Saint coming out yeah yeah it's like falling down your mouth my baby don't gotta melt anymore look at my little Keebler my little Keebler Elf like keyboarder I look like a little goblin err yeah let's look if you have like hair but then it's like everywhere I feel like I'm some shit off the Lord of the Rings or something mm-hmm one of those orc look at the nose it's like ah that's like some witch status right there don't eat yeah oh yeah it's not edible I'm sorry okay so it said that when it's fully foamed like it is right now just take a little bit of water and like kind of massage it into your skin we do not have a sink handy you guys so we're gonna have to pause I have like 10 more minutes for my math but you want to go over inches off in a second yeah let me go try it yeah let's try it tiny bit you guys they'll be with water but is that necessary yeah for reviewing it it's necessary okay we just splash some water on my hand pouring water in his hands right now how's that great oh whoa whoa it's a pasty clay huh yeah definitely is still so I should probably go rinse this off these poor starts falling over all right we'll be right back all right baby you are clean you're looking like shiny how does it feel it feels really nice it feels like my skin is almost a little tighter oh really like a little bit yeah like it firm like like a firming mask your skin looks good is it kind of healthy keep going uh I know because I'll really say I can feel the tightness of it a little bit I mean must be here we'll put some of this Kendall is getting nice on ya work your video mixer is happen like this skin is really hell are you okay yeah the natural highlighter all right I'm gonna go wipe this off you guys I'll be right back oh right I just washed off the mask it was a little difficult and I don't mind a negative way it was just like a really thick and pasty so I had to get the washcloth up in there but first impressions like how do I look it any different am i right or no no I mean I mean for having me to like rub it off kind of hard you don't look that red to be honest it feels really like supple saw okay yeah it does I really like it I'm like oh my god hi now obviously I like to wear masks a lot and I'm definitely gonna be testing this out more but first off you guys I think that it feels nice my skin feels like mmm it feels nice it was full like it's a little tight on the forehead area not to like and I don't want in a bad way I love that feeling of like a tight mask you feel like I actually did something all right so overall do I think that this mask is worth $68 you guys know I'm bushi as fuck so I'm not going to say it's not worth it because I personally really liked it of course this is my first time using it I think if you want to see how something works over time if it shows real benefits to your skin you do got to use something for about you know I think one to two months honestly now this mask says that you can use it two to three times a week so I definitely will be trying it out I will let you know in a later video maybe a favorite maybe a disappointment no but but um right off the bat I really do like it now of course this is a little heavy on the price so if you are not a skincare junkie you might want to do without it but what about your baby was it worth $12 I would say it's probably worth $12 I mean if you're you're down with your face being tickled a little bit in one to $12 I am I'm all I'm down to I'll be your French tickler thank you for watching the video I enjoyed trying this a bubble mask oh it was a cute baby it was really cool though cloud-based I really like my the more I'm sitting here I'm like oh my god it feels really good but okay we're about to have some in and out if you guys are not from the West Coast girl to the best like this is a not sponsors big fun to play by the food on your Damn Channel we're just in California and we all have any now I

you're me flying tonight right now you're landing yep are you guys we love you and we'll see you on the next one my see you guys bye guys 
yes what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today Jaden's not wearing a bra me neither I never do I'm celebrating the Union Jack and I'm just living for the UK right now I want to go back okay so today we're gonna try out some crazy skincare yeah now the glam glow glitter mask has hit Instagram its hit the internet and there are so many questions people are like it personally excited me and got me off because I'm a sparkle whore when you saw this for the first time what did you think I thought it was pretty cool I was like they got stars in it it's got your name written all over it exactly yeah so today we are going to be reviewing this glam glow glitter mask it is part of the gravity mud firming treatment entourage by now you know they have the classic silver we actually reviewed the blue one with mani yes like a year ago yeah which sold out everywhere in Sephora and now they have the Power Rangers version and now here is the highly anticipated glitter version which I can't wait to put on my face and see what it looks like it's I'm ready to see what's going on I'm excited besides all that we have the family collection coming out on the 21st BAM of October yeah it's like really close it's go away you guys I'm fucking shook to the ground so me and Nathan of course have a collection out if you have been sleeping or we haven't been online check back on my channel a few videos back we revealed the whole thing we did swatches yes we can and we are really really excited for this collection alright let's dive into this review alright so me and Nathan really love the glam glow gravity firming treatment I know most of you have seen this it literally has 40,000 hearts on Sephora calm I was just clicking it for the information I was like oh this glitter one let's open her up so here is the beautiful unit carton it is shiny and vallini now this will be launching I think the second week of December around December 13th and it will be on Sephora calm and I think the app and of course also on Glenn official website so this is gonna be fun for the holidays now this mask is allegedly going to firm lift tight tone and give us sexy contours for our skin okay I'm down for $69 which is what this retails for you get the full size of 1.7 ounces which that's pretty good and that size it is the same size so let's open her up you get of course the brush BAM which I love because if you don't have a face master brush you always get a brand new one with the brand and then here is the jar so let's pull her out so and it's silver it's gonna matte finish that's sick I like the blackened look so very nice there is that okay so the glitter used in this mask is cosmetic face grade makeup meaning the glitter that you would put on your eyes or anything like that so it is very safe for the skin a lot of people thought from seeing the ad because they did glitter on the models shoulder people thought that there was actual glitter going to fall out of the mask onto your body but I mean I guess if you've never played or seen like that yeah you would maybe assume that so of course we're gonna zoom in and show you guys and even right here you can see that this is encapsulated so the glitter is not coming out anywhere is literally in a gel encapsulated you are not gonna feel it you're not gonna really have any moments with the glitter it's just gonna look really cool for selfies and Instagram so other key things that I think are very important to know about this is that the glitter is not gonna clog your pores there is no really leave behind with these masks of course you'll get a few spots here and there but once you put it on this is a dry down mask dries just like the other ones they are going to peel off completely so a lot of questions I saw on Twitter today were is the glitter going to ruin the environment okay let's talk about that for a minute a lot of people were like well what if it goes down the drain and in the water this is a peel-off mask ellipsis so what are we gonna do after the mask is done you throw it away you know in the trap down yes you don't flush it down the toilet you don't throw it down the sink you literally peel it off wave it around right and throw in the garbage bin exact so there's that question it is not going to scratch your face and a lot of people were like why do they put glitter with the skincare girl its 2017 all right somebody I'm buying exactly that's exactly what they're trying to do here yeah I'm just trying to have fun with everything it's like a sparkle trend right now I feel like so yeah I think that everyone has a different type of brand and if you want really serious skincare then there's definitely Yan for you but if you're more into fun and fun miss we keep saying fun then this brand is for you so I think obviously you guys are waiting for us to shut our mouths and apply it and see what happens all right I do want to read what we're supposed to do with this okay so stir before use if required apply a generous even layer to clean skin where are our faces are clean we're going to avoid our eyebrows under eye area and hairline we're gonna leave on for about 30 minutes and of course we're gonna gently peel up and rinse excess off or I just take a makeup wipe if there's any little residue yeah so I'm about 15 minutes more than the normal mud mask exactly so yeah besides that you guys I think we should dive into it let's do this let's apply oh right let's get physical' they're on our faces alright so we're into a quick little stir and of course you guys can see on the zoom in everything is encapsulated cuz I have that same question too I'm like is that what's gonna happen with the glitter so let's take one scoop and just spread it on one side and let's see what happens and let's dive in baby let's do this oh it's so cooling oh oh you know what happen I just got it on my finger oh my god look at my face this looks so cool with the light think oh okay we're doing more we're doing more there's so many stars in this like there's so many looks cool dad we're doing a thick layer me I'm trying to like spread it out but you want all the glitter to show yeah look at me now without doing my forehead looks like I'm wearing like a ninja mask like I'm in mortal combat nice that's what sucked oh it's a toe that's out there sotto sotto you get babe yeah let me see yeah looks cool I look like a superhero yeah yours looks crazy as hell the glitter looks Akon it really does look like you're just wearing a mask on your face that's like it's cool okay so I'm gonna take my iphone real quick and I'm gonna turn on the flashlight the depth is crazy because of all the glitter in it like I was like it's okay when you put a flashlight on it oh look at that you guys I am living for this let me tell you whoa like there's real hollow stars in here like holographic real this right now shine alright you guys so currently let's show the time so y'all know we ain't lyin it is 6 p.m. oops I forgot to turn the flashlight on hello and we will be back around 6:00 3500 we're all righty we just got some exercise in the yard at the dogs mm-hmm went did okay so it is now it's oops come on come back it is 6:38 it has been a minute baby yes it has little over 30 minutes yes so shall we peel I think so I appeal you off a little let me try let me try you ready for the close-up y'all oh let's see if I can do it accurately Oh your hairs in there hold on hold on oh that's gonna hurt a little bit you got and your baby hairs nay palm out oh okay I said

was taking off a condom all right here is my mask this way look um I know look at my nostrils Astral's that is so funny it's exactly what my nose would go that is okay hey y'all welcome back to my channel all right so of course our skin is gonna be a little red yeah the treatment is in full effect Nate's skin is red because he has sensitive skin yeah I was gonna put it out there as you guys see my skin is normal Nate will let go on the Sun for five minutes and he has like a new freckle yeah so oh and you're rubbing your skin with a wipe this is fine oh look he's like is that bad I was like shit I didn't know no but um yeah my skin is literally like no redness all right I'm gonna go give his face a little spray of chamomile and we'll be right back Nate is red you guys yeah it would be like that for like 30 minutes and I hope you buy him so first impressions what do you think I mean I think it's pretty dope I mean aesthetically yeah it's fucking sick and obviously you feel oh I felt tightened and refresh yeah always I mean always from these glam glow gravimon's they're always gonna I love the experience of just putting it on I love masks in general doesn't matter what the brand is I just love that feeling of like you're doing something to for yourself to yourself I love the glitter it's fun to stare at and it looks fuckin badass on snapchat bitch yeah so we love it I think it's definitely comparable to the gravity mud family the iconic silver mask so I definitely think it's fun if you love glitter and you love skincare duh you gotta graphic when it hits the market in December but besides that I want to have my sounds with the lambs moment oh yeah well I'm alright you guys we need Jesus had a lot of help thank you for watching and other first impressions we also forgot to say one thing the glam glow glitter mask is Geoffrey star approved BAM we'll see what the next video wha see you guys guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel hi how are ya today I am finally doing my full face using only foreign makeup now what the hell does that mean well a few months ago I took a trip to Europe where I was in the country of Finland I was expanding jeffree star cosmetics and I am now in a retail store out there called Sol coast and we are in a bunch of stores we are about to be in over 300 so if you were out in Finland hi how are ya so basically we went to a makeup convention out there I had a huge booth I met a lot of fans subscribers and makeup lovers we're about to show some vlog footage from that trip in a minute but I thought I want to try makeup that you can't buy in America so know a lot of you at home are like foreign what do you mean by that now of course there's brands like YSL and your and Sicily this may be a little bit foreign but we're gonna go off the deep end so there's brands you guys that I'm about to show you that I have never heard about in my entire life until I went to that country so part of my trip was also to scout this place called so coast and see if I wanted my brand in there so I had no idea what I was gonna walk into so basically it is like a foreign Sephora they have everything from Maybelline to Urban Decay all the way to like natural makeup like they have everything there so I thought okay this place is legit and then one of the people they were like try out some of these brands that you can't buy in California or anywhere in America and I thought okay so I grabbed the big bag and I bought as much stuff as possible to do a full face so there may be a few items missing here besides that I do want to quickly thank everyone who entered my Gucci giveaway last week oh my god over half a million of you entered which is so crazy but shout out to the winners of course they were announced on my snapchat my twitter and they're also linked in the description of that Gucci video which is right before this one so shout out to the one arrows and of course I will be doing a lot more giveaways shortly maybe even in my next video so stay tuned besides that I'm gonna show you some footage from my trip it was so fun and thank you to everyone that came out to support their brand I really appreciate it it was like such a magical moment I love Finland and I would definitely be back in the spring for I mean great so here is the blog footage [Music] we can change anything and make it better together now we're strong don't question it the truth will break your cheese we have the key open your eyes and see [Music] [Music] [Music] inside one they can show anything will make it [Music] open your eyes [Music] [Music] everything you fighting for [Music] inside we'll find a place a we call home they can sure anything will make it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so it was such a magical trip like the turnout when I walked into that convention me and Nathan like our jaws dropped I was like wow so there is a brand in Finland called Lumina and I'm just gonna show you some of their packaging it looks like this so I tried to grab as much stuff as I could from the brand we have vase mist we have powder foundation we have normal foundation we have brushes we have CC cream we have lip balm ice shadow palettes mascara blush lipstick lip gloss lip liner we got it all so we're gonna try everything out today we're just gonna see what works what doesn't I'm so nervous alright so the first item that we're going to try is the lumen a Arctic spring water enriched facial mist ooh alright so this says that it is a pure hydration and a flash this refreshing mist made of ingredients such as Arctic Springs water and potent Nordic birch sap provoke Jesus provides skin with a hit of replenishment throughout the day okay so you can use this before moisturizer or over your makeup to freshen up oh it's like a fine mist okay mmm smells very skin carry all right so now this is kind of you know this is gonna make a little first impressions as well you guys obviously know I've never used any of this stuff before so as I go I'm just gonna give a little feedback and we'll see how I look at the end now other that I grabbed was the Nordic chic mattifying and pore smoothing primer this is more of my alley let's keep it real here so I guess we will try her out and then also I got CC color correcting primer which I mean I can't use all three so we're just gonna have to pick a few let's try this first woah it's like a silicone II almost reminds me of like benefit Porefessional let's just rub this all over and see how my pores look now looking in the mirror I will say this I notice a slight difference so from here to here I can tell I can see my pores a little bit more here seems a little bit more blurred but not like severely now we are going to dive in to foundation here's where it gets tricky I have like four formulas sitting here in front of me I could do a half face or I could just pick one I'm not sure what to do here but we have the sentence a flawless satin foundation now I will say there's this bottle I love the packaging it's stunning I love the ombre fade I love this weird shape I love a satin foundation and it's called flawless so let's pray it works great and it has SPF so you know what bitch hates the Sun you also want to show you guys that we got the where to go the sensei anti-aging foundation now this is more of a sure one so that's why I'm sure a lot of you were like its anti-aging put it on it's not the fullest coverage so I definitely probably gonna go with this one but I want to show you guys the weird packaging maybe not so weird but it's interesting it's cool it's definitely unique and sticks out and we also have the lumen a matte foundation it's looks like a Maybelline I kind of like component oh they're all sealed which we love so I guess let's just put you both on my hand this and this and see which one we like the best Oh bitch she is full coverage okay okay so that was this one now let me use a little bit of this one on my hand here oh wow that's darker than that one is that the shade girl okay well we're about to see okay you guys you know we're gonna do we're gonna take my finger we're gonna go like this okay that color match ain't you far off so there we have that one right here got that shear and then this one this is gonna be I'm scared of this color oh well let's just buff it into my skin this one is really yellow now I do have another shade though shade too let's shake her up now that looks like this shade whoa look at the it's getting like weird and sheer oh I like it cuz it's a little darker and it like matches my neck enough running my gums we're gonna try actually this one the aluminum matte foundation it's oil free this is shade 2 in soft honey alright I just cleaned out my hand and wipe that all off I actually had to uh remiss now I'm gonna reprime slightly because they did have to start over so where's gonna hit this spot one more time and we are going to put this on I'm just gonna do a little bit and see how full coverage this really goes well that's bounce alright so here is the foundation blend it out with just a few drops it actually covered a lot I like the coverage so far I would probably add a little more I think the color is good let's just pray it doesn't oxidize cuz then I might look a little crazy so far I think it looks really nice and let's just show you guys this side of the face which is fully done now and then the other side what you see online reverse is what you're getting real a right now I'm just going to finish up this foundation and see how it looks [Music] all right the foundation is on I like to just buff and buff until my wrists hurt but it actually looks really pretty whoa okay so I'm kind of shocked that I like the sound ation this much is settling nice it's not crazy or being weird it hasn't really oxidized yet praying next step if I were to do my makeup would be concealer here's the problem everyone let me show you this is the Nordic chic cover stick this is in zero one so this was the lightest shade which is kind of shocking I want to show you guys this is a literally darker than my actual skin tone so I don't know how I would conceal with this I think it's gonna look very weird I'm just gonna try this right here I was like a kind of a joke because look at that how am I supposed to brighten and conceal with this girl I'm gonna buff this out concealer the only thing I don't have so we're just gonna take a random concealer here because I'm over it random meaning one of my favorites the shape tape by Tarte mom we just need some concealer so I will be blending this out and I will be right back alright so moving on I definitely have to try there setting powder is Laura Mercier gonna be shook or what so what is this supposed to do is this translucent I guess we should probably read the box people okay directions apply all over face or in the t-zone for external use only thank God let's set the concealer of course it comes with this crazy little moment where we have to peel it back and let the powder shine we're gonna take our damp Beauty sponge and we're just going to dip once and let's see what happens [Music] all right we're just gonna let this bake for a second and let's see well what happens so luminate actually has a powder brush I am just going to sweep away this powder and let's see what it looks like okay I mean that definitely set my concealer didn't leave any crazy like lines to me or anything weird it blended in really nicely into the skin well I missed a spot also with this brush since we have it in my hand I want to try the long-wear blur powder so you guys know I love packing on the powder and this is a long way or powder foundation fast and easy makeup alright so we will see what this shade looks like this is shade number one again here we are okay let's put that on mmm okay and then we have shade two which I can't seem to open with this damn sticker so shade two looks like this and shade one looks like this so okay che - looks a little more pinky and I am definitely a cool tone so let's just dab this in here and see what happens [Music] now I'm gonna avoid my under eyes because I do not want them really cakey and I love them bright so we are just going to go around alright now I'm going to might as well just use this mirror let's see what this looks like okay she's definitely blurred she looks cute now that powder foundation was nice I will say that so of course next I would bronze or contour but guess what I somehow my dumbass did not get a contour or a bronzer shade I did grab of course a highlighting palette I have a cream blush palette but no contour I'm like mad at myself so I guess I'll just bronze up my cheeks really quickly and not do much of contour because I don't really need to today so I'm just gonna take my favorite Marc Jacobs coconut moment and we're just gonna take this huge brush and just kind of buff this into my skin very lightly its first dive into this little blush palette so this is the Lumina invisible illumination which is kind of a weird word because if it's invisible how are we supposed to illuminate girl but anywho this one has like a cream shimmer which looks something like that let's just do a little swatch on the hand it's alright it's kind of it's very doing glowy very sheer and then we have two blushes I would probably go with this one today and oh my god that's sheer let's put that right there okay wow this is for someone that probably doesn't want to wear a lot of makeup so we're to try it anyway let me take my damp Beauty Blender and just hit the apples of my cheeks girl what it's on the Beauty Blender I can see a little bit of peach but bitch where's the pigment hi the pigment can't come to the phone right now I do have more blush hi we got a powder blush here this is the lumen a Nordic nude light reflecting blush in shade - okay let's try this now I love the little design on the compact so we have to show that off very cute now let's pray that this one actually has pigment so I'm just gonna take a little NARS kabuki brush I'm just gonna dip in there a few times okay let's give it a whirl y'all let's give it a whirl whoo we have a little bit of pig man okay we were building on top of that cream that was already laid down so it definitely has something to stick to okay I'm not mad at it it's cute it's buildable I don't hate it but I grabbed for this every day probably not moving on we are going to try the aluminum Nordic nude the illuminating palette all right so this comes in the same type of component as the blushes but these are actually all powder and let's pray to God they work now I'm gonna take this little morphe rose gold highlighting brush let's try this one now what shade is this oh we usually I'm used to like okay no no okay so is this powder should we touch it first let's try she's full powder ooh [Music] let's just put okay enough running our gums let's try this out here whew okay we're getting somewhere is it the most blinding thing on earth no but on camera I'm looking into my monitor and girl this looks bright okay so you guys know what I like to do like take the highlight and kind of go all the way back I want to be so bright people look at us like alright now you know the drill we're gonna do our Cupid's bow BAM and if you're feeling it just a little tip of the nose if you will hmmm oh right my cheeks are looking glossy and pretty so high I actually do really like that palette just gives you a little moment of like mmm everything's on what's next feet ball so I'm looking down here and of course the next is eyes now a lot of you were gonna say Jeffrey where's the eyebrow pencil I didn't find anything new in the eyebrow realm that was acceptable to use this brand had like a pencil but no pomade no powder nothing so today we are gonna just serve a little extraterrestrial realness let's move on to eyes I do have the Nordic eyeshadow primer from Lumina now this is a smoothing eyeshadow primer for creased free vibrant and lasting color dab a small amount of eyeshadow primer onto your lids before applying eyeshadow the directions you guys I swear alright woah this is tiny okay let's just see what happens here now since I have no nails for the first time ever you guys are gonna see me apply this with my finger I know that is very shocking on this channel I'm sitting here shocked myself it feels a very like waitlist that should be enough I'm gonna dab a little bit under my eye now I shut up palette these brands did not really have a lot of like what you would call palettes like we're used palettes you open it up you're like holy these brands have more of like the drugstore realm of this type of palette so I got the Nordic in noir eyeshadow palette in style smokey it looks something like this the packaging is very cheap it feels a very like right ad where it's like okay yeah the qualities mm-hmm you know hey terminus you never know what you're gonna get right so we're gonna create a little look with just this palette you know mean we're gonna dive into here and just do a little base no I'm just gonna use brushes of course that I already owned there was not a lot of makeup brushes out there I'm like hitting this and it doesn't seem to be that much pigment on here but I could be full of let's try it oh and I'm full of yeah I'm just gonna pack that in there now this one definitely has pigment I'm gonna bring it up like it's a brow highlight and we're just gonna kind of buff up and out and keep it I see of course repeat on the other side all right we are alien out and we are feeling the fantasy so now we're going to take what are we gonna take here let's try I'm just gonna go bold and dip into this one and see what happens so this is like a smoky grey black it does have some fallout but hi it's an eye shadow it's supposed to not extreme though we're gonna dust that off I guess let's see if this one works Oh bitch and does she work look at that oh wow okay so luminaid playing with their shadows no I don't know what the hell I was gonna do I was just gonna do a little smoky moment so I'm just gonna drag this up into the shimmer and just to let it have a fade all right baby I have literally only used two shades and I've just flicked the brush up to create like a little a smoky moment and girl now only the only thing I have to say about this is that this shadow is so like it's very pigmented okay so it's kind of going into the white because the pans are so close so that's my only pet peeve but besides that I love how this is looking now we're going to go into this slate kind of what would you call this a bluish gray if you will and we're just going to lightly dab into that and now I'm going to place that right here and I tucked the brush off and I don't seem to be seeing any color on that shade one second there we go oh it is lighter okay well the other two shades look bomb I could honestly do a look with two eyeshadows and call it a day but maybe we'll try this one let's go back in with this brush and we'll just hit this guy what's the difference here I got a C that is so sheer why are these two bomb and these two not I'm just gonna take a little bit here and try to press this here not into it okay we tried so basically two of the shadows are great I love these two the other ones are kind of like yeah they're not the best but hey we tried didn't we to finish this up I'm actually gonna take this same brush and see if this color has any pigment right below my eye so let's just kind of brush that along my lash line and maybe smoke her out it's something it's very sheer actually don't mind it for this little kind of like under-eye thing but yeah that is just not that pigmented it's kind of bizarre how this shimmer shade is not as pigmented as the other ones but that happens with people sometimes or brands their is not consistent and now we know all right so I'm just gonna drag this out turn up the drama so lightly I'm like it's Jim no it's not dramatic I'm lying to myself okay so we're just gonna try to bump that up as much as we can and then I'm gonna actually take the same brush did all the shadow off go back into this very icy one here and just press that shadow right in the inner corner it's cute now it's time for some mascara now here's the problem with that they had a lot of mascaras we have the sensei mascara 38 degrees Celsius volumizing that's what that one is called very bizarre name okay the bottle is unique looks a little Lancome ewwww whoa that is a long on the end very bizarre hmm okay and then we have the illuminate or does this one deep impact mascara mmm okay oh I love these big ones okay and then we have the lumen a full on volume so we have full on volume and then this one let's see that what the brush looks like bitch okay okay and then this one has a seal on it it looks like the batch okay well I'm gonna go with the big boy you guys know I love big bulky things and let's see if this even works I like it a lot I'm like whoa I'm kind of scared a big one sometimes because he either makes your mascara look shitty or really bomb and look at the difference you guys I am not mad at this at all I didn't even curl the lashes just straight raw and they're Keela alright that mascara did the trick definitely love that one I'm shook about it okay so moving on now we have ellipse now here we go you guys we have lipsticks we have matte lips we have glosses we have liners but I think I'm just gonna pick a nude ish lip this one is called endless light and it is a matte lipstick let's see if it's really matte all right the packaging looks awake oh this is kind of basic nothing too exciting but hey it's a silver bullet right okay so we're just going to let's put it on directly and see what happens all right first impressions it's going on nice it's not like full matte it almost feels like a satin in a matte hybrid so far and let's keep applying I'll write the lipstick ooh this shade and look I'm kind of feeling this fantasy right now okay so this was good I'll give you my final thoughts in the outro in a second but I do want to put some gloss on it now sensei has this lip gloss no this is the silky oh it's all it's called silky lip gloss okay now this one just looks really pretty in the bottle it's like very shimmery and glittery let's see if it actually works I'm just gonna put directly on let's see if it works ooh y'all see that glitter okay [Music] oh it feels very slippery it's not sticky it feels very wet but in a good way I mean there's wet ever a bad thing Wow I am really liking this gloss already okay hmm all right you guys so I'm sitting here like wow my desk looks like a tornado we've tried out everything we possibly can here there's a few things I didn't get to try like lip balm do we need to try to lift balm on camera maybe in the future and some other lip glosses that we really didn't get to try from the brand that we can definitely implement implement implement we'll implement these in later videos if you guys want but that is the full face using only foreign makeup so I think it's time to give my final thoughts so first thought was there was no setting spray maybe I didn't see it in the store or get around to it but I didn't see one but when we go back to the very first product we use this one says that you can actually freshen up your makeup throughout the day well it's I've been filming for over an hour and let's just spray this on anyway maybe it'll give me a little extra something I like to spray in the beginning now that it's kind of like I've used it again it's very floral so it almost feels like you're spraying perfume on yourself if you don't mind that or weird fragrances then you don't you might like this one okay let's go through it primer and i beez better it was alright it was like a knockoff of benefit and i think benefits is kind of better so this was yeah it was alright foundation I love it I'm sitting here like I love the foundation this was very beautiful the powder foundation loved it as well the setting powder very much like RCM a colorless powder I really like this one so I think these are gonna be not staples but we're definitely gonna be keeping them any pile of stuff to use in the future now things that are popping out to me I love the mascara it was so pretty I'm loving this gloss even though I just applied it it's sexy it's stunning I love it the only thing I wasn't obsessed with was this guy now we all saw that these shadows did work I don't know what happened to these three the formula was not consistent and they just kind of flopped for me so maybe they're not the best with eyeshadow moving on I shadow primer and I mean it's on but my eyes always look like this so this didn't blow my mind and what else am I missing I think the highlight was cute definitely the blush though this invisible blush like I can't we're not using that again okay but the highlight was cute I did like it we talked about the mascara I'm kind of surprised so when I go back to this country definitely gonna have to grab some more stuff and also if you do want me to continue this series leave some feedback down below I have a lot of trips planned I will be in Italy in March I am going to Brazil and bonus Aires in Argentina in the spring where else am I going I'm going back to Finland of course and there is so many trips this year plan so if you want me to find other make up in other countries hit your girl up but thank you so much for watching today's video mwah I'll see you on the next one 
if you're happy and you know it highlight your face what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we're basically going to be diving into a battle of the highlighters we're going to test out the brand new Maybelline master chrome highlighter versus a luxury brand that is a forty two dollars for a highlighter Lord Jesus so today I thought you know what there are so many highlighters that have hit this summer Maybelline has definitely come out with a lot of products as well so I'm like you know what let's try out both they're both gold they both look cute they both look allegedly blinding we'll have to see in a second so if you guys are into blinding highlighters or you want to see if a luxury brand can finally be a drugstore brand on my channel then keep on watching look so I got this highlighter in the mail today okay I want to talk about the new Maybelline master chrome metallic highlighter okay so I did a little finger swatch on snapchat and I was a little like okay well shook so I kind of already know that this is good I'm just going to put it out there for you guys I know a lot of you have seen these on other people's channels you have them yourself this highlighter is pretty cool this is literally only $9.99 which is very good for a highlighter so today we are going to be battling it against the Charlotte Tilbury bar of gold now I'm going to just say this right here right off the bat we're going to try this one first but here is the kicker when I saw this online okay let me just show you what I saw on my phone when I saw this online I thought oh my god this is like a brick of gold it's going to be big like in my head I'm going to be so real with you guys nothing new but I thought it was going to be like this size like a brick that you open it's a big pan and it just looks stunning this is tiny I'm just going to put this up there this product is $42 like what the fuck Charlotte what's your tea girl because this is let me just let me just say it's a little over price I'm like girl so let's open her up now the design the the way it's put in there at the idea of like a gold brick is genius I think it's great I love the stamping I think it looks really cool I just wish it was bigger and for $42 this little dinky cardboard you guys this is cardboard it's not even plastic it's not glass I mean there's no glass highlighter was really but at least plastic Maybelline is like plastic and hard this one you guys literally like this is cardboard $42 for some cardboard and not that much products um I was a little angry I'll be honest when I saw this I was like when looking at how much product is in both of these the Charlotte Tilbury barbed gold has 0.15 ounces the Maybelline highlighter has zero point of 24 ounces in there so that's I mean almost I mean that's a lot more clearly but of course we are going to try out the formula that's what we're here to see does it blind as a glow is it amazing or not I think we should try this one out first now on the website you guys it says that this is a delicately fine gilded formula that will give you a instant glamour of a Bond girl okay luxurious pure gold pearls illuminate the skin and soft focus any imperfections for a lit from within glow so this is literally telling you guys that it's going to give me a soft focus appearance so you know we all know that sometimes we'll use highlighter than our pores will look really intense I guess this is going to minimize that and then also says that you can create a radiant glossy complexion in just five gentle strokes y'all know what I'm thinking right now across the cheekbones temples nose Cupid's bow and decolletage the light reflecting highlighter Slim's and sculpts as it transforms this is a big spiel for a tiny little highlighter I'm like what are they going to do pay my taxes and put gas in my car all right last but not least it is ideal for lifting dull skin hiding imperfections and adding that red carpet-ready finish to your look hiding imperfections I don't know about that okay well that's a lot of claims for a highlighter so I'm going to apply them with morphe little packer highlighting brushes this is what I personally use every day so we got the M 510 and then we're going to use the Y 14 on the other side so for the drug store 1 we will use this for Charlotte Tilbury we will use this so I just go in here and there's no obviously instructions of how to apply it's like you dip you put it on and let's see if it works let's figure out how the kickback is I'm going to take my cling brush and just go like this okay I see little brush little marks from it being in there so I'm just going to go back and forth and coat the brush cool I think that should be enough let's see what this looks like so for everyone out there watching we will do the luxury on the right side and then be maybelline on the other side here goes nothing ok I mean that's shockingly a more pigmented than I definitely thought ok but let me move it let me go in with one more little layer I want to go up here and I'm going to go up all the way into the hairline and then I'm going to do the temples on the side ok so I don't know about hiding imperfections now I do have this tiny little indent in my in my skin here from childhood but also you guys my pores which you can definitely see once the highlight hit it it didn't really hide imperfections but let's keep it real there's no denying that it does have pigment and as I move my face it looks pretty it does it looks kind of soft and like look as you see I'm moving my face it does give you that kind of like wet highlighting look which I personally do love I love when the skin looks a little like damp and golden what I like to do and I'll do it on both sides I'll just take like a brush and we'll just go in there I'm gonna put that right below the brow bone oh yeah I mean as you see you guys definitely has pigment and it looks really pretty alright you guys so this actually looks really really pretty so I want to try the Maybelline metallic highlighter now so let's go on their website and see what the hell this is allegedly going to do to me alright so this says that it's going to heat up my look with a warm metallic sheen featuring reflective pigments for an eye-catching chrome effect so this also says it's going to deliver a look of a melted metallic highlight in an easy to apply highlighting powder how do you apply it step 1 apply with brush or tips step to sweep on to targeted areas such as cheekbones brow bones bridge of the nose and then it says step 3 blend for a seamless metallic glow that's pretty standard I like that version a little more than the other one with its 10 statement I'm going to go in with this clean working brush only complaint I have about drugstore products would like to have this little sticker here and it's really annoying like I have to get like a little exacto knife or scissors and like slice it so it was a little bit annoying to get open when you have long nails but anyway it besides that let's see if it works let's swirl it all around ooh so when you hit oh hi definitely see it's on the brush when you dig in here it does leave a little imprint and it kind of like changes the pattern so you can see she's been a little bit used right in there shake off the excess let's see how this look bitch oh my god I like it barely dipped in there and I'm like holy shit girl get some fucking sunglasses bitch okay so I use this once on actually not even myself on a friend the other day because she was like I don't have any highlight I want to wear some so I put this on her and I was like okay I don't really like pay attention to it but on my own skin right now I'm like whoa that looks really pretty okay so let me take the same brush and do a little brow bone highlighting that looks really pretty girl whoa okay now let's take this and go in a little bit here and let's just do right here shun all right now this did say to put a little bit on the nose they keep it the bow so let's just do right here a little bit okay you know what's crazy now that these are both on my face let's just do a little head turn for a minute so of course this is the alleged Cherie side the bar of gold and this side is the Maybelline so let's do a little head turn and see what is going on okay so this is kind of crazy but I'm looking in the monitor and I almost feel like this is a dupe like literally it looks really similar but I'm not going to lie why do I feel like the Maybelline one soften my pores even more than the other one like this one's cute but I can definitely see that area and then you go over here and it looks more minimized I'm like hmmm alright so I'm going to go back in with this one and just try out a few more areas of my face let's just do the cube as well while we're at it that is cute it looks like I just drink some gold milk all right besides that area we can always do a little bit on the chin now let's just take this and do this side of my collarbones mm-hmm looks cute yeah the tones of these are really similar like this one is a little more like gold gold but this is really close it's like huh do we get a dew point our hands or what I'm just going to take my clean finger if you guys and actually go in with this okay and then I'm going to go into this oh my god is still so soft touch oh wow okay maybe it's my foundation but now that they're all my fingers they do not look identical at all as you can see this is the charlotte tilbury one it is definitely more of a pale yellow gold and then this one is straight-up like gold so you can see the difference on here on my face I don't see that big of a difference but I will say that the Maybelline one to me is more blinding it has more coverage it's definitely thicker I'm just going to put this on my hand so Charlotte Tilbury one BAM still really pretty I mean here is the Maybelline one BAM so there is the side-by-side comparison Wow my face it really looks more similar maybe it's my bronzer in the contour anyway I think I'm ready to give my final thoughts alright you guys so I'm going to give you my pros and cons and to me the Maybelline master chrome highlighter definitely won and why do I say that first of all it's 999 you can you see the state girl we're going to cheat now for $42 this has a lot of cons to me now the formula it did work I do want to put it out there you guys saw it first hand this is the bar of gold I think it's pretty I love the tone of the gold and the formula is beautiful I did not do as much as it said it was going to do my girl fuckin highlighter but at the end of the day I think the drugstore one is definitely more triumphant and it looks stunning now here's the Realty for $42 I just don't think that there's enough product in here and the fact that it is like kind of cheap cardboard there's no mirror it is literally miniature like can we hold them up next to each other I'm my girl what the Hale I mean I don't know now I do want to note that both formulas did work I definitely recommend the Maybelline one more I think it's more blinding it was more creamy add more coverage Maybelline you have a hit because this is a really stunning so if you guys are in the drugstore and you can grab this grab it it's crazy when I started my channel you guys like I was like only luxury and I'm still a luxury brand whore but the drugstore are like really coming for just everybody and I'm a little shook by it I'm a shaky aside about you guys I am just living in the moment with life and this highlighter is everything like I don't know I'm just like obsessed a bit I'm like oh my god this looks so pretty hmm yes it's like it's like a good setting powder actually like if you're just someone that loves the glow this is setting powder for your life I'm obsessed aren't you guys thank you so much for watching today's video if you are a highlighter addict like me I put up your right hand and say Amen sister thank you guys so much for watching this review and as always I'll see you on the next one

around we're gonna do the entire reveal and show you everything that I've been cooking up now I know the big elephant in the room no not my ass it's this mirror now this mirror is coming out in early December so this is like it's not a part of the exact launch with all the makeup but it is something coming before Christmas so these are in production I've been working on these for like six months I've been designing them and changing them the different weights I was like okay this can't be too heavy it can't be too light we gotta meet in the middle has to be a perfect star the local has to be amazing also little JSC logo right there and of course when you spin it around you do get a very big mirror that fits your face I mean hi now I'm tired compact and I just wanted my own mirror now there is hot pink there's baby pink and a few of my retailers will actually be getting other colors that will not be on my site but we'll talk about that later but I'm long story short these are $20 alright you guys let's get into what everyone wants to talk about these getting Frost pro pilots we are also going to be swatching every lip shade in the holiday collection BAM and yeah I think we should stop running our mouths and get to swatching so if you want to see everything revealed then keep on watching alright you guys so we all know and love these skin Frost they look like this well here's a limited edition one and I have had this product since last year so they have been around for like two years now and I always wanted something really big and just kind of like a showstopper so when I created this formula I was like okay the packaging has to be like a BAM so I did a very large pan of course most of you have seen and playing with these I thought to myself alright let's let's hear what the customers have to say and we have been getting a lot of feedback that's like Jeffrey I love your skin frost formula but I want to travel with like six or seven colors and the problem is they are so damn heavy if you put six in your luggage so here we are with a travel friendly palette so we have two versions of the of course skin frost Pro palettes now we have 24 karat gold and we have bam platinum ice now of course you see the unit cartons they look like brushed metal I love how this came out now of course a lot of you are gonna say what is the difference so let's dive into it 24 karat is focusing on all the gold tones it is perfect for medium to dark skin tones anyone on earth can wear this palette there is a shade for everyone now I do want to note that the pro palettes do have two existing shade plus four brand new ones so of course that is in the Platinum as well so we're gonna just open it up and see what the hell is going on so let's open her up this is what the palette looks like so when you open her up whoa you do get a cover that comes over the powder so they do not get ruined in transit and there's also a plastic piece that is over the mirror that you peel off like more you know like most normal palettes now let's get into the shades now you will note that King Tut and Dark Horse are both previous shades that I've already put out oh my god if you are someone with like a medium skin tone King Tut is going to be your best friend and if you were someone with a little bit of a darker skin tone or really dark dark horse and Giza are going to be flawless on your cheeks and you're going to blind everyone now I do want to note that of course you're gonna probably look at these two and be like whoa I promise they look a little scary but they are very wearable so first off we have a sarcophagus I'm just gonna touch these and ruin the pans because that's what we're here for so let's take some clean fingers and we're just going to go like this oh they're so creamy so sarcophagus is a blinding champagne ice color where it's gonna do a little swatch right here if you will and she is really like BAM it's like a lighthouse on your cheekbones next up we have King Tut if you've never seen it's watched before let's swatch and then of course we will do Dark Horse now Dark Horse I have been using as eyeshadow because it is such a stunning color it's that one right there so first let's do King Tut BAM and then we will do Dark Horse Dark Horse is such a pretty topaz like Oh of it now we are going to move on to the bottom row and now we are going to dive into legendary Giza and Liberace now legendary is a beautiful peach color really buttery and creamy so be careful a little goes a long way so let me just swatch this right on my hand oh girl I'm like hi and I've been putting this actually on like lipsticks as well I love playing highlighter on liquid lips now Giza let's dive into her this shade is so stunning Oh hmm here is Giza BAM oh I died the sixth and final shade in the 24 karat gold palette is called Liberace she is a stunning blinding yellow gold color I'm gonna take this finger and just do a little one too it's so pretty now this color is bull lining a lot of you saw me wear this on snapchat I put it all over my lid on set the other day and it just looks so cool look at that color oh very um now I know a lot of people are gonna say that looks a lot like fenty beauty trophy wife because I wore dove my lids and a lot of people thought it was that I'm definitely gonna do a swatch comparison right now so I have no questions they are definitely very different I'm actually gonna hold them up together no Fenty's is very sparkly full of glitter and it's very gold mine is more like a crazy hybrid of like yellow neon mixed with gold so they are very different so let me just swatch that and here is the comparison here is Liberace here is the Fenty trophy wife and I'm also gonna put it next to mine just so you can really see that how glittery and crazy theirs are and mine is just very icy so they are very different I just feel like I have to put that in there because I know so many people will ask for comparison so fenty I live for you but mama has the different highlights so this wraps up the 24 karat palette I am so happy with this I hope you guys loved the packaging the broquet on here with the gold on gold I live for it and I can't wait to see this in your guys's collection alright let's move on to the platinum ice now let's dive into the platinum ice palate now this one is very weird it's very icy it has some crazy colors so if you were someone that is a little more on the creative side this palette will definitely be for you so let's open her up and here is what you get inside platinum ice and of course the cover is full of diamond-cut pattern it is very blinding so once you open her up you of course take out the plastic and here is the other plastic I was showing you guys for the mirror there we go now the mirror is a very fresh here is what it looks like we have ice cold and lavender snow from the previous line and we have four new shades as you see Glacier alien ice pink chill and canary bling now I do want to note that five shades are the exact same formula that you guys love and know but one shade is kind of like a highlighter topper it is a different formula than I've ever put out before and that is pink chill so it was a little more on the sheer side I know a lot of you were like sheer jeffree star sheer not everyone wants a blinding highlight and I do understand that so besides the weird colors which you will see in a second this one has more of like a glitter moment where it's just kind of like you want to dust it on you just kind of want to do a little glow on the go and not be so in-your-face blinding this is gonna be for you let's dive into the swatches ice cold is a blinding icy color oh it's just so creamy I'm looking at it like mmm so here's ice cold it is a very icy and high blinding the second shade is called glacier this is like your Silver Surfer Marvel x-men moment oh I died for this color all right now glacier is very silver it is a little more intense and a very silver compared to ice cold alright now moving on in the top right we have lavender snow which is a very icy lavender moment it looks a little dark on the pan but on the finger it actually comes off as a more like icy lavender shea so let's watch her BAM there she is a very reflective mmm I think this might be my favorite color and the palette this one is called alien ice alien ice is of course you guys can tell has a green shift to it it is really pretty I've been wearing it secretly and a few of you have clocked me online but hey you know mama couldn't tell our secrets yet and here is what alien ice looks like you see how it has that really cool icy green type of feel to it I am pink chill is more of the of course highlighter topper vibes but I am going to a poor swatch it there it is right there on my finger let's swatch her right here so as you can see as you zoom in it does have really pretty pink reflex there's some glitter in there which my beauty lights are kind of not showing off the best but you guys can see it has a really cool shift to it's almost borderline duochrome but I live for it the last shade it is a really cool I see yellow color it is called canary bling and let's show you guys what she looks like mmm I die I'm like hi now this color is not for the faint of heart it is a very blinding and high I love this palette I think we should of course put a few colors on my cheeks and what are we gonna do today let's use the morphe Y 14 I love this brush and we're gonna go into the 24 karat palette and we are going to dip into sarcophagus just a little one two three and let's put her right on the cheekbones now I love this one because it gives you kind of like that wet cheek appearance so as you see all of a sudden my whole face has like a different type of light to it I am going to now take a little bit of sarcophagus and just do the tip of my nose Oh now let's dip into the platinum ice palette now let's do I'm gonna take the same brush and we are going to just do a little bit of pink chill we're right on top and just kind of pack her on know I'm not sure how well this is showing on camera but this is gonna give you a more blinding effect and just a little bit more dimension to your cheek so if you were someone that's not afraid to blind people there you go and now we are going to dip into what should we do a little bit of canary bling let's do it we're just going to do a little one two three now let's take the cheeks and let's see what happens BAM and there you have it oh all right got my gloss off and now we are ready to do some swatches so in the Holiday Collection here is what the unit cartons look like they are all crazy holographic and what is inside a lot of pure glitter madness now I don't mean glitter liquid lips I mean glitter packaging and I'm really excited to finally show you everything inside the component so in the Holiday Collection there are eight liquid lips and four lip ammo so we're gonna start swatching now remember these will retail for eighteen dollars as well as the regular lip ammo lip stick so both are 18 now there are a few metallics we got it like one nude but I really wanted to do something different because I have beginning so many requests to do a dark teal we got some Gray's we have some berries and some wine colors and just different colors that I've personally never created before it was time to go a little bit left and try something new so I think we should just dive right into it the first color that I showed online was mermaid blood and this color you guys oh my god one of my favorites I think I've ever created once you open up the box here's what the lipstick looks like we have full glitter I do want to tell you guys one thing that was a little crazy in production that getting glitter that does not feel gritty or like sandpaper was very difficult so I've been working on this for months and it's finally here it feels so smooth it's like glass and the plastic is a very of course sturdy you don't feel anything in his seamless and girl it was a chore but it came out so beautiful and I'm so proud of this so let's get to swatching ooh girl [Music] now this may be one of my favorite shades from the collection is just something very different for me and hi with this eye makeup alright let's watch the next color we are going to do let's do point sedia this one is a straight up holiday metallic red it is like mmm looks like foil on your mouth so let's see what she looks like Oh [Music] here's poinsettia yeah dry I think I'm like this is my favorite color no mermaid blood was this is such a fun holiday color if you're someone that just loves reds which who the fuck doesn't love a red lipstick it is a very vibrant and look so pretty when the light hits it it just gives us really cool like foil reflection and I'm living the next shade is called berries on ice and look at that shade this is a color that I have never made before I attempted to last year a little darker version of this and it just didn't work out so if you were newer to my brand my formula is vegan it is paraben free it is cruelty free and when you do a vegan formula you cannot use a lot of ingredients that make Reds easier right so if you are trying to perfect the formula it is so difficult when you are using just red pigments so this shade took a lot of work there is another one that I'm just gonna mention right now called Santa Baby and it looks like this it is a really dark like very red and this is a more magenta color now they are very different of course you can see it right there but these two were very hard to make because of the red pigment so they do apply a little bit more I hate the word streaky but you do or might need two layers I'm you know me I'm always a very upfront about everything so to get a full beautiful application well you'll see in a second you do need like a little bit of another layer to make the color fucking like BAM so let's swatch berries on ice [Applause] [Music] here's the color dried down now of course you sided but nested a little bit more than I normally would but the color is beautiful and I'm so happy that the shade finally it turned out good because sometimes when you were in the makeup lab when you were creating and you get frustrated you just kind of kind of put the idea to the side and move on so I'm glad that I came back and revisited this this color is stunning the next shade is a very dark nude it is kind of like androgyny stepsister and it is called human nature it is in the same family it may look a little similar in the bottle but on the mouth oh my god this one is perfect for the fall and winter season girl I think you guys are gonna really love this one [Music] all right here is human nature dried down mwah I love the shade it is giving me dark plum mauve nude vibes and I'm obsessed now the next shirt has been highly requested by you guys and it is literally a pure gold metallic lip now this shade is called first class and it is blinding and very metal looking I've been getting so many tweets for the last few months that please make a gold please make a gold girl I got you so let's swatch her down [Music] here is first class fully so watched I have been obsessed with gold everything lately so hopefully you guys will be too the next color is the perfect holiday nude and the shade is called Christmas cookie it is literally the color of fresh-baked cookies in the oven this color is in between a mannequin and celebrity skin yes it is a new nude it is not a repeat you know I repeat no damn colors it is a little similar but if you're someone that loves a nude lip pair this with a liner aware it by itself throw some gloss over and girl you are good to go [Music] now these seventh out of eight we are almost down to the finish line for liquid lips this color is a hybrid of a blue and a grey like if they had a baby and here she is the shade is called Medusa now definitely inspiration from watching all these crazy Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones shows and movies where there's just crazy creatures everywhere so I actually have a lip mo shade called gargoyle which we will dive into that in a second but gargoyle and Medusa are Grey's and this is my version of a gray but gargoyle is a very true grey which you'll see in a second but Medusa is a very unique color something in that this brand has not put out before so let's watch her whoa girl [Applause] [Music] here is Medusa dried down I think I'm gonna be living and breathing in this color all fucking holiday season all right you guys we have one more of a lower liquid lip to swatch final volu liquid lipstick shade is called scent of baby of course we mentioned this one earlier when we were talking about berries on ice now this color is the second shade where it might need another layer or a tiny bit of finessing here is Santa baby [Music] here's sent a baby dried down now we are about to dive into the lip ammunition but there was all eight velour liquid lipsticks of course sound off down below in the comment section and let me know what your favorite shade was from that so we're about to dive into the lip ammo now as I mentioned there are four shades now if you have been a fan of this brand for a while you will remember the first lip ammunition shade was called the beauty pageant which was a soft glitter that had a little bit of a shift to it it is more of like a something like a top where you would put on normal lipsticks right so that shade was of course it still isn't for sale but I thought hey let's make a different version so the first lip ammo shade is a glitter the other three are the normal satin formula now this shade is called champagne tears and it is a straight-up champagne glitter it is so pretty I'm gonna do a little swatch on my hands so you guys can see how it looks just by itself it is a very icy and it has this really crazy glitter to it so I'm just gonna use this as an example you can literally just take this and oh a even just right in the center it gives that really pretty look let's do a little bit up here mm-hmm now I'm gonna leave the side parts blank and just kind of blend it in mm-hmm so pretty so if you want to add a little bit of festivity to your lips or just a little bit of flare these are really good for that this formula but of course if you want to wear it by itself it will look really blinding all right you guys I am going to swatch the other three lip mo right here on my hand my mouth is like dying first of all I had a root canal the other day so I'm already having a little bit of pain over here from the procedure but my mouth you guys is raw so we are going to do quick little swatches over right here now I'm just gonna go ahead and say it I had to make the shade it has been a highly requested one of my top selling Reds ever in the liquid lip formula is Red Rum so I made a lip ammo version so of course most of you are very aware of the shade Red Rum but if you're not it is the perfect blue based classic red and here is what she looks like it is of course nothing crazy about it it is straight-up red and I am obsessed now remember these retail for $18 and these have a creamsicle yummy scent I'm hungry now the next shade we mentioned earlier when we were talking about Medusa is gargoyle now this is literally a slate straight-up gray something that has been highly requested as well that I have never made yet so we are going to just do a little soul watcher right there BAM now this formula is so creamy as you can see one swipe coverage I'll add a little bit more so the swatches look a little bit more there we go they can't erupt so that shade is literally just straight-up gray and I'm living for it the last lip ammunition shade in the holiday collection is a beautiful brown terra cotta and the shade is called allegedly I think this one is such a pretty nude for the holidays here is what she looks like it is so creamy I'm like oh that's so soft yummy that is what that shade looks like excuse my swatches you guys sorry I went a little ham on that last one it is a really cool little foursome so we got the glitter we got the gray we got the red and we got the terra cotta here are all of the lip munitions now the final products the V Holiday Collection are lip scrubs which are such a crazy product for my brand Ness like it's something I don't really promote heavily but they sell insane summer the blue raspberry and the watermelon gum flew off the shelves and sold out so I have also brought those back I'm just gonna sneak that and go in there those are actually available right now on my website they are finally back but moving along to a new flavors for the holiday season what the hell did I cook up you guys here are all three flavors now I just got to show you the component because oh my god the glitter looks so pretty and the lip scrub jar I am living for how this turned out so here is what the jar looks like full glitter now the first flavor is called lemon icebox cookies oh my god this this said this shade this flavor is so yummy all you got to do is take a little bit on your finger take some out rub it all over your mouth these are edible there is aloe vera in here it is infused with the vitamin E and it just leaves her skin so soft all over your mouth and I've even heard people have taken this and put it on their dry patches of their face remember laganja told me she used all over her face one day and she was like saying it was so spectacular so if you have any dry spots take a little bit out stand her down baby but lemon ice box cookies is so delicious I'm like yummy if the second flavor is a straight-up holiday classic which I've never done before and that is candy cane so if you're someone that loves mint anything you're gonna die for this one it literally tastes like a candy cane fresh from the wrapper like in your mouth oh hi I did like baby pink sugar for this one because I thought it would just be really pretty and not just to do like the same for all of them I love changing up the sugar colors so oh my god opens up my sinuses mmm yummy now last but not least the third and final flavor is marshmallow it literally is just straight-up marshmallows out of the bag and in your mouth this tastes so good I'm very into desserts and sugar I'm sure you guys are aware by now by watching this channel so yeah here all three you guys we got lemon ice box we got candy cane and we got marshmallow I really love these they're different than what we've done before and I hope you guys like them too wow I can't believe this reveal is over I'm

bitch she gonna whip her fuckin hair what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we are gonna dive into the crazy box of crayons eyes shadow palette now I know last week it was a little rough that Nickelodeon palette mm-hmm I had nightmares for two days after every morning I'd wake up screaming because there was no pigment so today we're gonna pray hope and cross our fingers has some pigment now this is another item that I found via the internet BAM it looks like this now I'm sure a lot of you have seen this because a lot of you guys have tagged me tweeted me sent me this photo it's been going viral on Facebook so I'm like okay let me pull up on this little palette and see what the T is so before we dive into this review I quickly want to let everyone know that literally we are one day away tomorrow the blood sugar palette and the love sick collection is finally out into the world and available I also have some really exciting news besides the blood sugar palette I also have of course new jeffree star cosmetics accessories we have the mirrors bags shirts but I do want to let you guys know for everyone wondering about the pink and the hot pink mirrors they will also be restocked the same time as the launch so get your engines ready bitch alright so first of all we haven't just the makeup so if you're done hearing me run my mouth and you want to see some eyeshadows and keep on watching so I got this from their website you can get this only on the cran case dot-com another brand you can see there's a big old logo right here so at first I was like is this a Crayola collab but it doesn't say anything like that on there I think it is that's the brand name it looks big like look at this I was like oh wow when I saw the pans on the internet I did not think that they were gonna be this big which is always nice when you see something and a picture and it's always bigger in person who doesn't love that when you open it it comes like this it is wrapped up very secure which I love so we're just gonna take off the bubble wrap BAM now this does say that they are cruelty free on the box and this box is recyclable recyclable is that a word recycle Reese okay now just for size comparison no I'm not going down on anyone I am going to show you a comparison of vinegar Lodi and pallet versus this pallet so you can see there will edge it up here this is how big the difference is so she's massive when you open her up bitch you see BAM all the colors and they are big like those pans honey I'm like oh so as you can see I'm actually swatch two colors on snapchat the other day I'm sure most of you already saw that but everything else is brand new and fresh I have never put anything on my lids of course I did buy this palette myself just for the record want to put that out there so I know that this palette is constantly in and out of stock it's gone viral all over the internet now as you can see the shape names are simple they are named after it actually says it right here they are named after obviously crayons in a box so you get a large variety there's a lot of metallic shades there is a lot of maths so I just can't wait to play with this baby so the quick T on this palette is that it retails for $30 now the box of crayons palette is a all new 18 color eyeshadow palette and they use I with the letter I now it says with bold and vibrant colors that are extremely pigmented okay and long-lasting the box of crayons palette were hand-picked by the CEO this palette is perfect for playing in multi colors alright it also says that they were named after school crayons which I'm sure is a given by now as you can see whoo all right so I think the only thing there is to do here is shut my mouth and start blending and let's see what we could do here people so we are going to prime my lids with the Mac painterly paint-pot of course I've been using this on my channel for a long time now remember the old days when there wasn't an eye primer girl I would just slap on some foundation and call it a day so I tweeted that I was going to review this and I snapchat and a lot of you told me to compare it to the jus vyas place palettes and I was like are they similar so here is a Julia's place palette I only have two arms open this one first these are very iconic now all over the internet because they have amazing pigment so this is what this one looks like here is what this one looks like okay bitch I mean literally they are the same pan size but a million brands use similar pattern sizing there's only so much you can do it circles and squares people ovals rectangles so yes is there a similarity definitely with formula who knows they are very different brands so I'm sure the formula has to be different which we are about to find out right now so besides that I don't think this palette looks like anything else of course they are very vibrant it looks crazy I'm gonna pray that these have pigment or mama is gonna come let's just dive into this review we are primed the lids are smashed what the hell are we gonna do I think I'm just gonna go bold here and go right in to yellow like high let's do some yellow all right we have barely any fallout I'm talking like none the brush is a very coated look at that yellow whew okay now of course this palette has a massive mirror so I don't even need to use a mirror today from anywhere else let's just see what happens [Music] I'm smiling cuz I'm like oh my god for this pigment it's blending I'm going to just create just a little moment in my crease you guys know I love to go into the brow bone right by my nose and just kind of blend up and we're just going to make this look very alien and very airbrushed so yellow is actually looking really pretty I'm like wow since there are so many colors in this palette I was thinking of doing different shades on different eyes just for fun haven't done that in years that was very my space like one I read one eye blue what are we gonna do you guys I really just want to kind of go bold over here obviously this palette bold but I'm talking like yellow red orange magenta over here and then over here maybe we do like purples and the darks and just see well we got deep plum with brown I'm inspired okay for an easy transition shade though for over here let's just go into the shade tan right here and I do have two of the same of a lot of brushes so you will see me dip back and forth don't think that I'm spraying or doing anything weird so we're gonna go in with the same brush and we're gonna dive in to shade tan she's on there I think let's see how she performs okay it's blending nice I literally just dipped in a few times and the shadow instead of dragging or looking weird as I blend up it's actually looking very airbrushed and pretty which I love bitch this is looking cute already okay cool so we have two colors on they blended nice alright so let's dive in this is the more vr38dett just Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Oh pink this one is really great for just placing in the crease and blending it's very soft and build the ball which I like for these rainbow looks oh girl yes this is giving me like starburst vibes when Nate eats all the Reds woo alright this blended out really pretty I'm like girl okay so I want to add some red in I'm living breathing and dying for some red shadow let's go in what is this this is the morphe blending brush and now we're just gonna go in with shade red and let's see if shade red wants to work alright so let's take this one we're just gonna place this actually right in here and I'm just doing some patting motions and some swiping in here so I took more on my brush and now I'm just patting it on my lid and then I'm gonna take it and just kind of blend up alright so the only thing I'm noticing with this one it's a little streaky as you can see as I'm zooming in here so so far this does look cute I'm not hating it at all it's just looking a little streaky alright so we're gonna go in with shade red a little bit more and this one does have a little bit more fallout than the other ones brush is looking a little crazy it's not fully opaque like I'm packing it on and it looks pretty it's just not living for when I try to blend it up it's a little patchy so now for over here I'm gonna take shade Brown which is right above tan and we're just gonna take this and place it kind of like where this one was where the pink kind of merges together and let's start smoking this eye out and then I'm gonna take that blending brush from earlier dip into shade tan and we're just gonna kind of buff and blend them together and make them look cohesive so now I'm gonna dip it to shade black whenever I see a black shadow in a palette I want to know girl is it rich and beautiful or is it patchy because black shadows can be tricky so I'm gonna go in with a little more fee for one one blending brush let's dip in to black right here ooh she has the more fallout than the other is she kicking back alright so let me just dive into there okay now let's see what happens [Music] so this black is very pigmented which I love I'm just blending it and buffing it in with the brown and the tan and it's looking seamless like the shadows are blending together it's not the best black I've ever used but it's definitely something that works now let's dive into the metallic formula we see the mattes we know that they're blending they're cute but what about the metallics this orange is calling my name this gold calling my name so let's use this little Tom Ford fresh and I will try it dry of course and then we will see what happens okay it's alright it's a little sheer going one more time so as you can see there definitely is some payoff I thought it was gonna be a little more blinding let me try to do some fix+ or setting spray whatever you will on the brush the brush is coated oh oh okay that picked up a lot more so let's see how this looks on the lid definitely adding some setting spray made that pop really cool so this is looking like a little fire now the red for some reason as we've blended and time has went on it's gotten a little muddy so I am just going to you know it's really funny I've actually never done this on myself I'm gonna take this so excuse me I'm doing a little bit of cheating I would never put this on with my finger but it's just not holding like the greatest coverage someone's gonna Pat this on my lid and see what happens oh wow okay hi but the fear is if you go to blend it in with the brush it's a little weird so let me take this one more time I'm just try to finesse it in there it's like a bobble head on my back alright so now we're back over here oh she needs some work so we are going to dip into gold bitch I have I'm also going to try my finger let's do a pinky and see if that goes on the lid nice pinch my finger it looks like I just fingered The Wizard of Oz honey she's fucking rolling looks like a leprechaun sucked on my toes anyone else did two foot fetishes I'm not I swear here we go BAM right on the lid Oh hold on I know I'm blocking the camera hold on y'all oh not the prettiest application because my finger is not that cute but I'm about to fix it we're gonna go on with this little Tom for a blending brush a little pencil brush if you will she actually does blend though so we're just gonna take this gold and just drag it a little bit over here y'all want to see what I used to in high school I just took it there fuck a setting spray bitch you know what we did in the early 2000s when there was no setting spray where you spit baby and look at that pig man because she went right in there and that looks so stunning oh my god alright I'm actually gonna take some of this gold cuz it looks so pretty and I'm just gonna tuck it right in here like on camera this is gonna photograph so pretty now the metallics do have a tiny bit of Fallout I'm not mad at it cuz look at the pig man I'm like oh and then take your brush that you used for the black of course with no extra product and just kind of go over that line I know what I do want to do is I do want to quickly take the yellow because we are gonna blend it in a second with another shade and just kind of buff it under alright now with the same brush I'm gonna take a little bit of pink right here I was gonna do magenta first of all I'm gonna swatch it for you guys cuz it looks crazy look at that oh baby you guys know I don't like finger swatches it's all about how it blends with a brush or on your lid but that um whoa whoa and then the blue I got to do the baby blue like I want to do a whole look of just blue Lord okay we're gonna do one more let's do the dark blue one okay and needs a little more finessing but the blue is like it's like actual glitter in there okay baby I'm done I'm gonna dip into shade pink with the same brush we're gonna go a little bamm-bamm and then I'm just gonna literally put it right over the yellow it's really simple just drag that right below the lash line not fully fully where the yellow is just a little bit now we are going to wet this brush a little bit we all know the metallics love a good little wedding over here we are going to dive in to shade white right here it is a metallic and we're just gonna go right in there okay now we are going to place that right in the inner corner let's see what happens I'm also gonna drag it down slightly just right here so it looks like we are oh wow oh oh okay I think she has some payoff right now wedding though this one it's like whoa was like a beam of light so I'm just finessing the yellow in there so it just softens it a little bit more I'm actually living for it though it's a very intense okay you guys so now that we were having this full sunset moment let's hop back over on this I over here girl okay we're just gonna be really extra I almost want to do purple down here like I know it might not even match but God I just would dip into that will you guys be mad at me let's find out all right so this may not match now this was a little bit of like on the shimmer to it but it appears to maybe be mad let's dive in and see now purple girl I know it may not be the color of the season oh it actually is the Pantone color of the year hmm [Music] she's buildable okay I will get at that yes you put a little bit more on and it's there that purple definitely was buildable and I'm just gonna take a little bit of the violet shade right here and I know it's a metallic and you probably shouldn't use this brush but I just like to add a little bit of like a little bit of depth very evenly you might barely see it I know it's there and my eye knows it's there whoa okay this is a very weird look none of this is cohesive I would never wear these two together but you know what I don't give a fuck I just want to try out as many colors as possible for you guys let me scootch my booty back into frame alright this is the weirdest I've ever looked well know eighth grade was pretty rough alright but I have a lot of thoughts okay so I'm quickly gonna go do some mascara and pop some lashes on and I will be right back let's give our final thoughts on the box of crayons eyes shadow palette okay I have something to say this palette was cute okay bitch it was enough to rip off my motherfucking hair because girl had pigment a minute the ambulance is outside okay the straitjackets downstairs okay so wallah so we are going to give our final thoughts on the matte formula first most of them were bomb the black the brown the tan the pink the yellow lived for it of course you guys saw the only one I had a little problems with was the red but it's lasting it's a little patchy but I'm not mad at it like it didn't underperform where I was like scared it looks great so I think overall yes it needed a little finessing and they could improve the formula on this one but bitch Reds are hard alright so moving on to metallics now girl you guys saw this whoa this orange and this gold BAM like they are stunning they're blinding the white one maybe I did a little too much to fix plus which that's on me I'm gonna clock myself but overall obviously this is very blinding I just felt like it was a little like a little harder to blend but my brush was very wet so I think that was my bad I definitely want to dive into some more colors in the future but the goal was the star of the show for me as well as the yellow y'all those are kind of hard to kill for other brands so what I have to say is for $30 you get a massive size palette the pans are big I think you get a lot for your money this is also an indie brand so of course I love supporting indie companies just like me voila all right so is the box of crayons palette jeffree star approved yes god this palette is great I think it blended out beautifully but yeah everything down from the mirror to the packaging I think it is very cool I love this idea and I love that this palette is getting so much attention online I love a good idea all right you guys thank you so much for watching me try out another eyeshadow palette I will be back shortly aka in a few days Olivia miss you mean it Wow bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we are going to highlight our whole bodies are assholes or cheeks our mouths our lips our eyes or a hairline we're going to highlight for the cause asshole where does it come from I mean I'm going to highlight it there is a new highlighter that has been out for a few months I have been dying to try it it has been referred to as the putty highlighter has a crazy texture and its really blinding allegedly do my friends have tried it out here in the YouTube realm and I'm like you know what it's time that I try it so today we're going to be talking about the Stila heavens hue highlighter comes in a gorgeous gold a unit carton you all know I love Stella I'm wearing it on my lids right now this glitter is the Magnificent metals glitter and glow eye shadow uh-huh come on QVC commercial no but these are unreal and I'm obsessed with them they've been in favorite videos you've seen them on my tutorials now Cielo is back with something new and I am dying to try it so let's open her app when you open it up it comes in this gorgeous a little compact and it has the shade name on the back I got two shades because there's only three and one of them was like a really topaz and the other two were more kind of iridescent so I got kitchen and transcendence can you open them up they come with a little protector like a little plastic thing so you can do away with that now this compact is really pretty I just wish it was like a little heavier I love like really heavy things this feels a little drugstore which is not bad by any means but it does still really liked when you open it up of course you do get a mirror with it which I love and the price for these retail is a $32 and if you go on the website it gives you a bunch of tips and tricks of how to use it so of course we're going to read those so let me show you guys the other shade so of course this is kitten it looks like a beautiful champagne color and then we have a trend send and it looks like this I did already touch it with my finger on accident so you're going to see a little fingerprint in there but this one looks to me more like a purpley light pink lavender type of thing we'll see in a second so for $32 you get this guy and you get 0.35 ounces which is basically 10 grams of products of pretty good for a highlighter now on the website it says that this is allegedly going to be a natural-looking radiance enhancing highlighter with a unique texture and a barely-there feel it is supposed to melt into the skin for a weightless feel ultra fine light diffusing particles help skin look lit from within with a soft luminous natural looking glow I'm like natural okay I'm still going to try it that word is a little weird now it does say shade descriptions which I find interesting so kitten the champagne one it says it's Steelers iconic shimmering nude pink which will brighten and illuminate and this one transcendence is an opulent pink for a bolder Easter roll glow okay cool so basically I'm like how the hell am I supposed to apply this I just want to touch it before we even apply that's kind of my goal so I'm just going to take clean fingers right here and I'm just going to press into it oh it's almost like oh look at my fingerprint you guys holy shit it does have that like weird type of like click clay or something okay so you guys could tell it is a crazy I'm gonna do two fingers like let's just push in there I'm like do I want to break it huh whoa look at that whoo okay I'm like how the hell are you even supposed to apply this so let's look on their website because I'm like I'm shook am I going to kind of cracked it a little bit okay so you guys can see you can push on it and move it and then like move it back whoa okay so a suggested usage how the hell are we supposed to use this it says apply with a sponge or a dent stippling brush okay got one of those or fingers blend onto cheeks eyes and can be a worn alone on bare skin or over foundation well mama is wearing a lot of foundation today no no shocker here so we're going to try it against every which way I kind of want to go in with my finger and just see what the hell happens okay so we have a clean finger here let's swirl it around whoa it just feels like really weird it almost reminds me of the Kylie cosmetics wet set but hers actually felt like hold on I got her right here y'all got it right here hers actually felt like almost cooling to the touch where this one is the more like Airy like it feels a lighter if that makes sense so let's just swirl it around I'm going to go in on my bare skin right now let's see what happens oh okay is anyone seeing what I'm seeing like oh okay let me just buff that into my skin it feels so weird to use my finger but the finger worked really well as you guys can see wow that's pretty let me slow it around a little more oh my god look at that you guys like a little mirror on my cheek it's just sitting there like hey whoa I'm like going in for the close-up like this is really pretty that definitely matches my lipstick girl look at that cheekbone it's like glowing for life if you didn't pay your electricity bill just open up the compact apply and bam problem solved okay obviously this applied very well with my fingers I do want to take a brush for fun and make sure the products on there and we clean or clean so this is a little Kevin of Kwan highlighting brush this can be used for powders for creams for really anything and I really love it so it said a dense little brush this is definitely a dense brush and I'm just going to swirl this around oh it coated it instantly so obviously I'm gonna have to cheekbones or what else could we try on my face you guys we can do a little bit of nose we can do the chin I'll just go on my chin like it's an alien fish craft and then we will take this and just do maybe the little bit of a nose oh my god so obviously if you want a more natural look you can take a damp Beauty Blender or even your finger and just kind of buff it out for those of you that do not love you really really crazy crazy glow you definitely can just use this and make it more subtle if you will I think subtlety is not we don't like subtlety on this channel I'm like a little shocked at how like quick that shit worked hmm let's try the other shade all right now let's try the champagne shade kitten I think it looks so pretty I'm already gonna guess that it's going to be a little even more blinding than this one because it's not like a straight-up like metallic feel to it so of course I'm going to touch it with my finger yeah it's like when you go to the police station and they ask for your fingerprint that's kind of what it looks like that's what I would know that let's try this cheek I'm just going to take a little hair clip and push her back as I can and then I'm going to I mean I guess we can do our fingers again this shit fucking work last time I'm not really about using fingers on your face depending on the context but let's give it a whirl so we have our clean fingers now we have our clean fingers and I'm just going to swirl this around Oh oh-ho okay Stila look at that blinding rose gold color I'm like a little shook right now okay so let's just go in whoa it like glides on to the skin so easy I don't know what it is but this applies like really easy I'm going to take the pigment off of your last color and then I'm going to go in on this brush again just for fun this is really pretty it gives you that kind of like sweaty extreme highlighter type of glow and I love it I think of course if you want to tone it down you could take it and tone it down but I could I'll live or how it looks now I do want to take this and maybe do a little bit on my Cupid's bow without getting lip gloss all over myself okay you're a little trickier ones you have gloss on in this mouth girl okay you guys the only place else I could think to put it is like maybe my body just for fun so I'll just take a little bit of my collarbone maybe okay it says put on the body so let's do that oh wow okay I don't know how it's really showing up on camera but in person when I'm looking at this I'm like oh okay so like bling bling alright you guys I'm a little shocked at how easy like they apply it it was very like oh and then looking back right now on this side it was definitely really really blinding like watch this one Mord on my finger it is like really blinding but I think because it's really close to my actual skin tone it's not I mean though that's pretty bright its blinding it may not look as wild as this one because this in this course is lighter than my natural skin tone and this one kind of like blends and I'm like okay I know the answer that everyone is already going to be waiting for and you guys already know you guys just watch this I am a pleasantly surprised and shocked at how well these applied I am going to beg Stila make more colors the formula is really pretty it glided on really nice it was soft I mean it has pigment I love how it looks it's very Airy almost live like nothing's on my skin which I love because momma already has a lot of full coverage foundation powder concealer contour so adding on something else it just kind of weighs you down it's always kind of like but I am really happy I am pleasantly shocked at how well it just worked I'm like oh okay alright I think you guys are already going to know the answer to this but the Stila heavens hue highlighter is Geoffrey star approved these are really great I think they're fun $32 not too bad now I think that Stila is like one of those top tiers so for brands that can definitely price their makeup a little more pricey than others and the formula really worked I'm like wow I love brands that just try new things and new formulas and just new innovation I'm here for and I love it so Congrats do it I love your highlighter all right you guys thank you is so much for watching another highlighter review now there are so many products coming out all summer long so sound off below let me know if you guys have anything in mind that you want me to try or of course tweet me that will always be a little easier for me to see it sometime so if there are any crazy products you want me to review or try out let a bitch know alright you guys thank you so much for watching as always and I'll see you on the next one bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I'm wearing Nathan's clothing and no one to wear but today we are going to dive into my July holy grails and fails and girl the tea is fucking hot in today's video we got some good products that talked about Sebastian some shoes and dildos so before we dive into the video I just wanted to say hi to everyone out there and just chitchat for a second July was really epic like I cannot believe how quickly the summer has just flown by I think whenever I do favorites videos I like to think to myself like okay what were like some big monumental moments I had and in July I mean the biggest one was me and Nathan bought a house in Grand Rapids Michigan hey shout out to all my Michigan is out there I'm a resident so hold on to your seats me and Nathan had been wanting to get an investment property for a while now I'm really really excited for the next chapter for me and Nathan I know everyone keeps being like when's their wedding anyway my wedding ring this is just jewelry that I like wearing we don't have promised rings we don't have celebratory rings we don't have chastity belts and we definitely do not have engagement rings we are perfectly happy just how we are for now what will the future hold you never know but besides that you guys I'm really excited to be in Michigan a lot spend some more time there I love it out there it is so peaceful so this is literally a spot for us to go to of course as parents are going to be living there they are going to be taking care of the house it's obviously theirs as well and I am just ready to read a Stephen King book and hibernate in the woods for a week every month besides that you guys I'm really really excited because we are about a month out from RuPaul's Drag Con so my brand jeffree star cosmetics case you forgot my brand and myself will be in New York City September 9th and September 10th and we will have a booth I am also one of the main cosmetics sponsors for the entire event there's supposed to be like 20 30 40 thousand people there I'm like oh my god I'm also really excited because I am many MUA and laura-leigh they will be at my booth we will all be doing signings and their merch as well as my entire brand will be available if you guys want any info or a code to get a little bit of a discount on some tickets that will be linked down below alright if you're done hearing me run my mouth and you want to get into the damn favorites video I'm sorry keep on watching let's dive into some makeup so I think something that I covered my entire body with the last month was the master chrome metallic eyeliner from maybelline if you missed this review last month I coated my entire face in it it is that good but all jokes aside this formula is bomb for a drugstore brand to come hard like this is better than Mac I was like oh okay hunty so in case you did not see my video I'm just going to take a clean finger right here and just do a once-over good morning this shit is so blinding you guys I was a little shook when I first tried it like look at that powder I'm like oh wow bling bling bling it is just so stunning and I just want to rub it all over my body it's blinding affordable and amazing so really what more can you ask I think that Maybelline is really killing it with their formulas and they better expand the shade range so I'm someone that's very particular with their concealers I've been using the same a few for a long time now and I really don't like to change because every time I try a new concealer some horrible happens or is just not for me it's hard to get a flawless finish that does not crease and fine lines or look weird or cakey and I think I kind of found something that I'm in love with and it's not like the full of coverage on earth which you might shock you all but it is in that medium like stunning I don't know why this is so good type of range and this is the benefit boying airbrush concealer I love that name now this packaging is really cute this is new for the brand and they put out a range of concealers recently and this was the one that stuck out to me now it is in this turn like thing and as you see in the pan it looks kind of mashed because I like to take Beautyblender I love to take the Beautyblender dam and I'll literally just go in there and then apply it directly from the sponge and it looks like I don't know I like fate which I love I'm down to look fake if you don't if you want to look really real well you shouldn't wear makeup at all but anyway I just love how this makes my skin look it is really beautiful and has a really good coverage so if you want to try a new concealer try her out okay you guys now this is a new primer that I discovered on Sephora calm it is from the brand touch insole now I discovered them a while ago because they had these crazy metallic I type of like liquid eye paint things that I fell in love with when I saw everyone using them but this guy now I'm all down for new primers I love testing stuff out on my skin I click the link and it said smooth and pore covering top secret for perfect makeup so I'm like girl let me try this out so I word on on the website it got to my house I tried it with my like one of my favorite foundation so that's something I like to do you guys if you have a favorite foundation and you want to try a new primer stick to the foundation because a lot of the times I review so many things I like do a primer and then all of a sudden I'm like using a new foundation because I'm Michael I just want to try this if you really want to know if it works try it with something that you already know what it's going to look like so I've been I mean you can see in the bottle I've been going in on this one I'm wearing it today it just makes the skin so like oh I don't even know it's like you put it on your pores are very minimal like they kind of vanish which a lot of primers claim matte and then as you see on this channel they don't and the name though is a little I don't know why the name and annoys me it's called no pore bloom like no problem but no pore bloom so it's kind of a tongue twister but besides the name the formula is so good alright now I didn't think this day was going to be here but I caved in and Jacqueline Hill got me to buy the Dior forever foundation and I was like okay everyone says this is great but with someone like not someone when a bunch of people say something is great I don't know why I'm like that rebellious little like 12 year old comes out when you and you're like don't want it oh everyone thinks is a great girl I'm done with the hype I'm good so I do kind of get that attitude sometimes so I was like no not doing it then I saw Jacqueline use it for like the fifth time in our video and I'm like bitch does have good skin and it looks so sickening when that foundation is on earth so I'm like you know what mama by n let me see what's going on now if you've been watching these since I started my channel you know that the Dior air flash is literally my favorite foundation on this planet I've been using this for years and I recommend it to everyone the formula is just Oh insane if you go all the way back to my channel in the very first video I know I'm using this and I think I'm in the second and the third video so I'm always like you know what how can I even make a better within this right this is my eighth time wearing the Dior forever foundation and I will say that it is a top runner for the air flash and my lemare I don't know what is in this the formula it's amazing like of course I'm wearing it today and I just love how it it makes your skin still have that kind of natural look but it still looks a little plastic I know that's kind of like hypocritical or doesn't really make sense but like you look like you but just a little more like a version of yourself and this does last all day I got know a lot of times I'm doing foundation tests and by the end of the night oh not so much but for some reason this does last a long time and it has sunscreen in it which you know anti-aging bitch right here I'm all about so if you do want to splurge on a high-end foundation I would definitely recommend getting a sample of this or just buying it if you don't like it return it but I highly recommend it the next item on the Holy Grails is a watermelon glow sleeping mask listen the name first of all reeled me in okay the baby pink packaging I'm done for I like that it's simple it's glass it feels heavy the pink cap I'm like obsessed with and now I feel like I'm a little girl again so check this out it's hard for me to really fall in love with like a skincare brand that's new but a lot of you were tweeting me this and you're like okay bitch we know you love watermelon I know have a watermelon lip scrub I just love a fruit so people kept tweeting me this thing and I'm like okay where do you buy this so I type it in it's on Sephora of course and I buy it and we are now three weeks in and I'm obsessed with it you put this on before you go to bed if you want or you can use it as a mask and wash it away in like 20 minutes but I love to put it on right before bed sit there let it soak in for however long roll over you wake up and I don't know what is in it that makes your skin feel so a little baby like it's just so nice so it's hard for me to really tell the difference when you use all this shit all the time like I try a lot of stuff so when you see a lasting effect it's kind of nice so this is a little on the pricier side but skincare and if it's good you got to pay for it in July I reviewed this mask with Nathan on my channel if you haven't seen it check it out but this is the talkshow violet C radiance mask now I've used about 747 times now throughout the last few weeks and I really love how it makes my skin feel during the day I wake up I cleanse I put this on 20 minutes wipe it away and I'm like oh she's feeling a little younger so this is that purple mask if you didn't see me review it check it out now I haven't used a lot of this and I've only done it on myself me get your oh no no I'm just kidding but I really really love tatcha I don't know why but their brand is like consistently just amazing and I'm falling more and more in love with them I know they are a little bit on the pricey side but if you want something that works but you got to pay for it alright now let's dive into some fashion now I am a high heel lover I know I was born of the penis and I'm obsessed with high heels so what is wrong with me someone pray for me tonight please but I am obsessed with Christian Louboutin I have a separate closet just for my red bottoms and this season jesus take the wheel I had probably worn these a 4 or 5 times now and these are is really cool like a ballerina high heels they've been worn girl than bread bottoms on say bread forever and this wraps around your ankle and it just looks so stunning and sexy and elegant I love having sex in these I love going out in these and they just look really pretty and give you kind of a dainty vibe if you are a dude but still have shoes in generally they also come in pink black and blue and I think I have them all so if you love a sexy heel or you want to wear something to a party and fucking turn it up girl what are you waiting for all right now my bitch ass is going to start having a section in these favorites videos that is just like okay here's the most extra item I got this month okay so me and Nate love don't laugh at me exercising with like basketball tennis air hockey video games I'm down for anything you guys take me to the shooting range and I'll fucking I'll impress you but we found that Chanel made like tennis racket with balls of course of course Chanel made balls and I about died when I saw this so get a set of two and they come in this of course the Chanel logo is right here it looks so cute it opens the zipper and then the best thing on earth besides my ass is this racket okay maybe not the best thing on earth but it is pretty stunning to me because you know my fashion whore I love a good Chanel and this rakia girl this grip is strong and get the low CC right here but of course the star of the show is the actual racket itself we took this out the other day and of course you get a cute little pouch full of balls who doesn't want balls and you get four balls they look like this I mean come on Chanel tennis balls is like bitch I'm down so if you want to come to Calabasas and play around with us call me all right now we are going to get to my fails of July stuff that just didn't really work out for me the first on the list is going to be something that you guys are probably like bitch how about did you even find that well I love Chanel makeup and a lot of a time they got a hit their highlighters are bomb we've had a few misses on my channel but overall I love them actually I'm obsessed with their powder I'm actually wearing it right now I wear this all the time bitch I'm about to hit pan up in here but besides the powder it has really good lip glosses actually this is so fucking sad for the branch only because they're melted honey lip gloss was in my may holy grails but a lip gloss that they recently put out look at this guy's black lip gloss I I expected something fucking amazing let me show you what I got when I when I got when I got home girl I don't know what this is supposed to just for me when I put this on my lips and I blend it out I was like I've been sucking off a volcano it was not cute it I don't I don't get the point of it like girl and then for 30 plus dollars I'm like I really needed something to like have some coverage show up like I don't know I was definitely gonna have a gothic moment again like high school but nothing happened so I don't know what this for maybe it's looks like dark another lip colors or add some sorta like Halloween feel I don't know but this lip gloss flopped for me girl subculture I know it just came out in retail in August but this came out really late July you know your girl trying it out and I'm like I think this palette has been through the wringer on YouTube most of us by now have seen it experienced it been shocked by it and overall this palette just did not work for me the formula was kind of off and I wasn't living for it was extremely powdery in which is fine and a lot of you out there we're kind of like well if it's powdery you know who cares so we're a lot of palettes I get it this one was just like extremely powdery and the problem that most people had is it just didn't blend amazing like their previous shadows but you know I've said it before overall the brand is amazing this palette was just a big flop for me and it's crazy how something like this has turned into such big makeup news and it is such a search thing online thank you for everyone out there that watched my review I love that you guys watch a bunch of people's reviews but then you're like we really need the Geoffrey approved stamps so that really means a lot to me thank you guys for watching that but overall this palette girl I'm ready for their next palette that's what I that's all guys all right you guys I want to go downstairs and play with these balls and a two balls and my own balls I love you guys thank you for watching today's video and I'll see you on the next one what 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel and today we are going to be diving into my June Holy Grails and through the month of June I always stay here when I do favorites videos and disappointment and I'm like what the hell happened this month well I guess I think the biggest change of all is obviously I'm blonde I still have blonde hair it's been like three weeks and I'm kind of loving it it feels like a limb is missing or like it feels like a part of my soul is just not really present without the pink hair because I've had it for literally ten years but um it's cool it's a different change I'm starting to like it definitely going to do hot neon peach or pink in a few months because I don't know how I don't know how long or less but we'll see besides that in the makeup world there were so many launches this month we had the Jacqueline Hill morphe palette we had my chrome collection we had Kylie's vacation summer launched we had Kim K's infamous contour sticks which has caused such a ruckus online and there was just a lot of launches this month I don't know if you guys support all four of us but there's just so many people supporting all of the different launches and it's cool to see everyone just sharing their love and obsession for makeup and that's why we're here so it's just really cool to see everyone be excited about products now I know a lot of you were skeptical about my Kim K contour stick review because I did make a one small mistake and you guys know I'm always down to clock myself and call myself out I did not show how much product was in there and a lot of you were like Geoffrey you always talk about the weight whatever honestly I don't review sticks ever so I did not think to twist this stick out all the way and there was really not a lot of product and as so many people were mad about this brush girl I even said in my video the sponge sucked I did not like it this blended it out was it the best thing on earth and no girl you know I'm a Beautyblender whore but I'm at the end of the day there are so many other youtubers that have reviewed the product of some love it mani hates it Laura loves it talk to you thought it was cool and the cool thing about making these videos we're all going to have different experiences there's primers using my friends on a girl this make my pores look disgusting I'm going to say it right here now if you ever leave a comment hinting or even joking like oh girl you're on this person's payroll so you're going to say it's great bitch I'm the one that threw Kylie's lip gloss swans in the trash last year and ended up on CNN so don't try to act like I'm on someone payroll but anyway besides that you guys let's dive into my favorite products first and then we're all talking about a few that kind of sailed for me so besides that I'm just going to talk about my first favorite product I guess right now because it definitely has to do with drama this is the Jaclyn hill of morphe palette I'm sure most of you if you have a computer have seen this amazing palette let me open her up you guys I'm going to be really real I mean I I'm a fan of morphe I like their products in general I know there's always controversy about people pushing them and no one else we would trust and are they good are they bad morphe is such a solid company and this is the problem a bitch that drips in Chanel makeup and Tom Ford and I love I mean I like brands at work and morphe is always consistent okay so when I heard that Jacqueline was going to be making this palette I was really excited because she always has great ideas and we high champagne pop and what so when I saw the colors I was like okay this is really cool because not everyone can buy a hundred palettes a year there are so many launches all the time it's like I don't know how the you guys keep up I can barely even hold on to my seat so when I saw the color like story and everything I put together I was like oh my god this is genius because you can literally create so many looks from its palette so let's zoom in because these pans are definitely being a used I think this top row is just really easy and everyday so what I'm wearing on my eyes you guys is actually this is the highlight this guy right here it looks almost like a matte in the pan okay clean finger let me just go like this it is really blinding so I put that in the inner corner right here and I'm using this one this one this one and this one in the all over and it's a really just nice easy palette they're definitely pigmented I know a few shady youtubers tried to swatch them and say that they weren't pigmented y'all are shady and you try to do jacqueline dirty and you're wrong for that this palette is amazing it is definitely pigmented it blends like a butter anyway besides that I'm just going to talk about one more morphe product you guys know I hardly ever put more few products in my favorites but I don't want to sound like one of those bitches but I will say this you guys a month or two ago they put out the prep and set makeup setting spray girl listen I've tried a lot of thinning sprays in my day I love being doused whether it's in the morning or in the afternoon or at night I love being doused and my face ellipse for it so this is really good for when I'm done with my foundation my concealer my contour I powdered my entire mug I love just spraying this on and just letting it all like mmm like blend together and just I don't know which six tool is really refreshing and look at that the aerosol it's like it's not like a spray it's literally just like oh it is just so refreshing and I love like touching up my makeup throughout the day and like literally I'll put this in my purse because that's what I do and I love taking a Beauty Blender it is kind of like patting it all in and literally my foundation stays longer than normal so definitely a big fan of it and morphe is very affordable so if you're like on the fence about some of these setting sprays because I know when I try to load of this one is 14 and 99 I think it is a really good deal and it's a lot of product in here alright next alright next up on my favorite is the Kylie cosmetics wet set highlighters oh my god okay first of all shout out to everyone who watched my review and thank you guys for always trusting and believing in my opinions and what I have to say it's unreal how many of you watched this like over 4 million already in just under two weeks I'm like this was the star of the show in the collection for me I know I talked about in that video but privacy please this top highlighter it's just unreal the texture is very just weird and cooling and soft it's just so silky I mean literally a blinding mirror I just love the formula it goes on the skin just beautiful it's just I don't know I know I mean everyone else a stunning so much but girl like look at that I really hope that they make more shade in this formula because I really love it I know a lot of you were like okay Jeffrey does it feel like the color pop eyeliner it does kind of have that gel like texture but this one is even more intense and it almost feels cooling in a weird way I just really love the formula and I know I think the sold out in like two minutes so we're crazy and I'm sure whoever has this out there agrees with me it's next up on the list I got to do a little shameless plug for myself because I had a really crazy launch for my own brand so jst of course had the chrome summer launch with a bunch of stuff from the lift ammunition guys skin tight which is what I'm wearing on my mouth right now it's just an easy classic nude you can use it with a lip pencil if it's too light but I just loved I'm sorry I'm like and from the liquid lip collection I know I am a matte lip whore but I love the metallics that I've been making and this one is called a candy ass it has been such a hot seller you guys are coming really hard for this pink rose gold moment and I really love this I've been wearing this a lot lately as well I just want to give a quick little thank you to everyone that has supported the collection is thus far it has been like we like we look back at last summer and it's literally quadrupled in sales and the growth of the brand you know my little baby that I started only two and a half years ago has just grown astronomically and of course it would not be where it is without you guys so thank you so much for believing in my formulas and my brand all right next up for makeup this is the last makeup item in the video we have the brand new maybelline superstay matte ink basically like liquid lip heaven I really love these first of all let's talk about the packaging for a liquid lip I think it is really cool I love how of course the colors coincide with the component on the outside so you know what you're getting and you know every liquid lip has like a window where you can see the shade this one doesn't it has the color and I kind of like it it's different it looks kind of futuristic I know everyone has their opinions about packaging I like it now the color that I've released I got to me that I've been wearing lately this one is called loyalist I'm just going to swatch it for you guys because I love it and I love that doe foot it's like that little shaped moment this shade is so pretty nude you guys I live for it and the other one that really stuck out to me is this shade dreamer it's a beautiful like mauve nude if you know me my hand swatches oh that shade is so pretty I really love those too they also have this really really bright one called a heroin it is I mean you guys to the plastic it's wild but let's just swatch a little bit right here oh if you're someone that really loves the bold bright summer-like colors you're going to love this and I love the formula it feels really lightweight and these stay on for a long I want to note that in between takes of likes watching stuff I like to wipe them off because I am notorious for getting stuff on my clothes that liquid lip did not want to come off and I've barely had on my hand for like a minute so I imagine on your mouth they stay on all day and you can definitely do some activities that I'm like we're talking about right now alright so besides makeup you guys know I'm a fashion whore and if you didn't know now you know so I love to talk about my favorite sunglasses of the month I always share with you guys what I've been seeing very screenshot on snapchat and these ones you guys girl let me just put these along these babies on so these are like coffee glasses these are from Versace and another bougie I'm just obsessed with how they look girl nothing like turning your head and seeing a highlight and then sunglasses like why does that get me off I'm just like now I love this because it has a little V detail right here and when me and talk to you were in in Vegas recently which of the Versace store and at the crystals mall and I got these there I love it I love this metal thing it's like I don't know so if you're a sunglass whore like me check these out before they're gone alright last but not least in this fashion realm Louie Vuitton recently put out these amazing bags where they teamed up with an artist named Jeff Koons and they let him take like really famous paintings like the Mona Lisa and then go and put them on handbags oh my god listen from from a bag whore like myself I about gagged when I saw this look at this beautiful DaVinci bag of course Leonardo DaVinci created and painted the Mona Lisa who I actually have tattooed on my body and I love it because she has no eyebrows and he knew July by the way what is Mona Lisa with a man they don't ever think about that ever maybe I don't know so this bag you guys is so what stunning when you open it you can actually read about the painting in here it gives facts that literally says the era that it was done the Year 1503 I think I was like four it has is beautiful like a peachy color in here the bag is so stunning with all the hardware like involved in it it like you can feel it but it's like in the leather it's so stunning there is a just signature and I am just obsessed with this I think it is so cool they have a whole collection of bags and wallets and I'm just a huge fan so if you are a Louie collector out there anyone watching or if you just love a handbag try to snag something like this because it is so good to have for your collection and if you're someone that just like the stare at like I'm obsessed I like put this out in front of my bed and I was just like looking at it for a minute like alright you guys now it's time to get into a few disappointments and when I say disappointments I always kind of want to put it out there these are not things that I hate this is just something that did not work out personally for me or a product that I have an issue with so I do want to always say something like that because you don't see we're trying to try it and they try to make it twist it around and make it seem like a Samba today okay I hate to put Milania in here because I love the brand and I wanted to a full-face Milani soon let me know if you guys are interested in that so this is the retouch in a race light lifting concealer and here's the real tea I actually like the formula here's the problem there are no shades a light enough for me literally it's like identical to my skin tone or darker and I'm girl like every shade is literally darker on me and I'm like what the I cannot conceal and highlight with the same color of my face this is like the lightest one you guys it's almost like yellow on me like it's just not good but let me tell you this the formula is really good okay cling finger test it's really thick it's almost like I mean it covers you guys through the tattoo in my hand right covering the lipstick it is beautiful I love the finish I tried it even though it was a little dark for me just to see what it would look like on my skin and it blended amazing for a drugstore concealer I mean look at that tattoo gone so the formula is great but Milani if you're watching this bitch make some lighter shade thank you alright last but not least something that kind of flopped for me is from the brand and NARS now normally I like their stuff I love their blushes but this one is the highlighting palette okay first of all when I when I try to wear highlight you know I expect the lining I expect metallic and I know not every brand is into that but NARS I'm like okay NARS is going to bring the heat you open it up right and I'm like oh those look metallic those look shimmery those look stunning then you go to touch it girl first of all the formula is not that bad it is silky it's a little like powder it just feels a little tacky to me and you look on your finger and you're like oh damn and then you swatch it on your hand and it's like okay and I know I'm putting it over the stain but once you blend it out it's like kind of shimmery and I know I have like Kylie stuff on my hands so I'm gonna try to clean off my hand it's just not blinding and it did not go on my skin amazing it kind of fell flat like here I'm still really going to take a brush and when I was putting it on I mean look this is the end of the video guys so we're going to douse my face in highlighter let's just put on my chin right it has like this white cast of like baby powder or like I don't know look at that oh I just did not like how it looked on my skin I hated it I was like girl it's like white chalk like it's literally I'm going to take this and try to blend it out that looks rific I just not like the formula and I really was expecting like the line and it kind of sailed for me so NARTH not this time baby definitely not for me but of course if you're someone that likes a more subtle gloww you may like this but for me it was like it's like it was a mess all right you guys thank you so much for watching my June holy grails and fails I hope you guys maybe try out some of the products in today's a video let me know what your favorite item was

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel oh my god okay so I do this thing where I search late at night for new makeup products to try out for you guys and of course you guys highly request a lot of stuff as well so I really appreciate when you guys show me some crazy ass shit the other day I was scrolling on neimanmarcus.com now Neiman's always has some crazy luxury shit and I stumble across a brand that I tried out on my channel a few times they are called clay Depot and they put out a 250 dollar foundation I'm like oh my god so I was back on my channel and I'm like what is the most expensive foundation I've ever tried and about a year ago so if you've been following and subscribed for a minute you know about this already I reviewed the laferrari skin caviar foundation which is this guy right here I will link this down below if you want to watch it now this at the time was about like 200 to 225 dollars it was a foundation that also had a concealer on top so it's kind of like you get two products for one so I feel like okay this brand over here that I'm about to review just stole the show and came out with the world's most expensive foundation I'm like oh so of course you know my bougie ass has to try it I did order three shades a no shocker here because you know I'm not trying to match myself with one shade online with a little circle swatch that probably doesn't even look like the damn thing also I wanted to remind all of my East Coast subscribers that on September 9th and September 10th I will be the main makeup sponsor at RuPaul's Drag Con and is a huge convention if you haven't heard of it check it out and my brand will be there I will be there Mannie and Laura will also be at my booth we're all doing meet-and-greets and you can shop my entire collection so everything will be linked down below if you want to look at tickets and of course I do have a discount code for the event for you guys and so that will be everything will be linked down below as usual so I really can't wait to be back in New York alright let's jump into it okay so what are the world's most expensive foundation look like well the box looks something like this it is a nice gold kind of brush metal-looking feel it is very is big this is a big box to our foundation I will say that it feels like a break like it feels heavy which is great because the inside better be good now this is called the foundation all right I mean look what that parts pouring do you even need a catchy name I don't even think you do so this foundation does have an SPF of 21 in it which is great because mama don't like the Sun now let's open her up and see what the hell is going on in here now it does have the shade names on top so I did get three now I also reviewed I know you guys were but I also reviewed a clay Jo post on nation a while ago and added a foundation battle versus what in wild and I reviewed this guy right here and in a lot of you were making jokes because the foundation was so small now this one is from the same brand and this one was a hundred and twenty which I thought was insane I liked it I wasn't the biggest fan of it and it didn't even have an ounce of product it's like 0.87 ounces is in here and I'm like for that price point bitch are you out of your mind so when you open this up this is what you get now I have been saving this for on camera I have not even peeked inside yet oh wow okay I don't want to fall out so there is a looks like an instruction manual and then we have let's take that out oh my god this is stick you guys like a damn book okay so it comes with this and it comes with a spatula I'm going to assume to scoop out the product because it is in a jar and it you want to be sanitary of course and then it comes with this oh wow this is like a kerlick looking plate looks like really like a diamond cut it type of little moment and then after all of that to peel this back and wow here is the foundation okay so I'm just going to say it right now this is heavy it feels like a weight like this shit is heavy alright so you guys see it has this kind of like glass acrylic type of feel to it this is the lid and this part is kind of like a frosted moment you can see through it when you zoom in and it just says the foundation on it nothing much to say huh oh okay so I'm just looking down at my table so this is like a look your foundation gets its own little moment look it can sit and have its own little seat and then I'm going to assume this goes in here so let's just open this up while we while we're here so your foundation not only gets its own furniture it gets a spatula with a little holder look at oh it's right in there BAM all right you guys so I think it's time to read the instructions and try it on all right so here is the long list that it has to I guess put on the makeup what it's supposed to do oh my god this is like the longest list I have ever seen for a foundation before so let's dive into it I am not about to read this whole thing let me just skim through the highlights here so this foundation allegedly has a innovative formula that instantly fails at your complexion with moisture and promotes more beautiful skin over time so maybe this house luxury skincare in it that's kind of what it's saying here this foundation encourages a heightened sense of beauty today and beyond girl did someone that write books write this damned pamphlet so let's go over the highlights of what this is going to do this is going to work to reduce the appearance of damage caused by environmental stress we all got that hunting it is going to have a smooth texture it is going to there's a lot here you guys it is going to provide a finely textured finish without looking powdery it is going to promote the appearance of firmness and resilience a foundation is going to do that for me girl it is going to infuse my skin with moisture it is going to give it read texturing effects let's continue to use it is going to enhance my skin with softness and suppleness it is going to reduce visible signs of dryness it is formulated with rose essence that inspires a feeling of elegance and luxury hold on you guys mommy needs a break I'm like all right so before we read on how we're supposed to apply it lets go in with some primer so I'm going to use my Sicily double Atencio primer this is $120 so if we're going to be trying out of bougie ass foundation let's just go in for the kill with this one this is actually amazing I know a lot of people have tried it since I have used it I went to the store in Vegas a while back with Tati and our get ready in my private jet video and the people at the store in Vegas were like girl the sales on this have been up since you've been using it and I was like happy but no that's really cool that so many people have been trying it because of me the price point it's fucking stupid but fucking work [Music] all right so we're going to let that soak into the skin for a minute now let's get out our book again and to use apply the foundation following skincare or the application of a pre makeup base we just did using the spatula provided applied foundation to five points forehead nose chin and cheeks great to smooth the foundation over your cheeks with two or three circular motions working upward and outward until evenly blended that's kind of confusing am I only allowed to do one to three motions and it's supposed to be good or until evenly blended well obviously I'm going to probably do like a hundred brushes so it's a lot less complete the application by smoothing condition over your forehead and nose and around eyes and mouth girl I'm going to put the foundation over my whole damn face obviously my ears my ass my fucking teeth Synovus gang okay so the foundation I've tried from them before was in shade B 20 so I got B 20 in this one as well doesn't mean it's going to be the exact match but we are going to try it out alright so when you open this foundation you get this and I'm like oh my god what the hell it is actually sealed which is great for sanitary purposes but it looks like it's filled to the brim which I love so I forgot to mention that this foundation actually has one fluid out unlike their other one that not even a fluid ounce I'm like bitch okay woah it is filled to the brim so the foundation a lot of it is on the little thing this is probably like what $50 worth on here so it also looks like this inside and you know I got to do a smell test everyone clear my palate very floral but it has that like luxury skin care like scent under it which is nice it's not like overpowering where the floral makes you want to like throw up it's pretty nice so we'll just try a little bit on my face and see what happens I'm a little scared like is that too much I don't know I mean I guess I'm just going to take the brush I'm just going to use this little Lancome brush and let's see what the hell is about to happen [Music] okay and we're blending we're blending oh wow that is really sheer for how much I put on and it's glossy so as to be like matte esque but look at that it's like huh my skin looks like it has life though I'm not mad at it okay let me put some on my forehead and a little bit more on my face so let's see what happens okay there is the second layer on this part of my face there's a little bit on my forehead I think it's only fair that I put a little bit more on my forehead just like I did on the face so we'll do that it's not like looking cakey at all even with a second layer it's looking very lifelike all right now while that dries let me just hit my neck a little bit all right so now let's take the little mirror oh I'm looking the monitor and like yeah you see a little discoloration in here and then you turn here it's like oh this is like a very like it almost looks dewy like not almost it does look dewy it is a WoW I'm like kind of shocked right now I'm like my face looks like really shiny does it not I like a more of a full coverage matte look so I'm not sure how to feel about this yet it is like very sheer something medium to full on the website but I don't know I'm like doing a lot of it or hate I can't figure it out yet okay let's take a damp Beauty Blender sponge and apply it to this side of my face alright so there is the first layer with the Beauty Blender and my face looks like the whole thing is glowing now definitely I don't even think it's medium light coverage to me because I have a little pimple here and you can definitely really see it so I'm going to do a second layer and see what happens all right so now that I'm zoomed in on myself with the mirror I am pleasantly surprised at how like shiny this looks when I'm looking at the monitor I don't necessarily mind it but up close it is really shiny and I'm going to take like a dry clean hand and when you touch it it feels a little tacky like it almost feels like the primer which is weird because normally foundation when it dries does not really feel that tacky so yeah you can feel it on your face when you touch with your hand but right now it feels very like lightweight like I really don't think there's anything on my face right now which is nice we are going to do check-ins later in this video I have an event I'm going to later so I will be bringing my vlog camera again so many of you really liked it when I did it a week or two ago in the laura mercier video so much you know why let me try to do it again so I am going to do some concealer contour foundation I'm going to actually do my entire makeup because I do have to go out tonight and then we will really see how this looks but right now before I do anything else it's very share like I like a full mask and one that when they said medium on the website I expected medium and I don't know this is teetering on the verge of sheer and medium I'm not mad at it it did have to put two layers ok I'm not living and I'm not hating either I'm just kind of like maybe not used to this type of finish but like on me I'm just telling ok now that this have a lot of anti-aging and crazy stuff in it is allegedly supposed to do so I think it's only fair that we do some concealing and some light powder just to really see how this wear is so let's get into it so I'm going to go in with the new Dior skin forever concealer this is a I think this just actually just came out I think oh yeah if you just once I'm like do I think you know I do when you review a lot of products you guys sometimes you forget I'm like try this I think this one drives quick so I'm just going to do my under eyes and then do the rest in a second look just use this and see what happens all right so that actually blended really nice over my foundation now we all know sometimes when you put products on top of another product they just don't mix well together but overall this concealer is great but I almost wish it was a lot almost I do wish it was lighter so if an some Dior's watching make a lighter concealer please okay so I'm going to take this and do a little bit here we are going to just do a little under my contour today we're going to brighten the stand face up honey all right this is a blended to perfection now I am going to set it with a little bit of my bougie-ass setting powder from Allah Mayor of course this is the powder one of my favorites of the year so far and let's send this concealer of course you guys know we're going to use a damp Beauty Blender dip into that powder and have it melt into our skin now if you guys have been following along we are we have now used the foundation and now the powder so if you can't remember these product names that I put down the pipe all right so I am going to go finish the rest of my face I'm going to do literally everything full glam tonight and then I will check in and let's see how the hell the foundation is wearing all right guys it has been about two hours since I have put on the foundation of course I finished my entire face and I've been outside for a minute and look at my phone so if it is 88 degrees Farenheit here it was like 90 95 degrees like it a few hours ago but the Sun is finally setting it is now 6:35 p.m. so I'm actually about to go upstairs and put on some clothes and then head on over to Manny's house we are going to the wet and wild midnight mermaid makeup lunch party tonight so you guys will go with me tonight I'm going to take you on a little ride and we're going to see how long the foundation last it's gaining really well so far

Brendan look normal yeah look any different it's good it looks really good this like nice full coverage I mean sonic full coverage in two more like it's like a medium i hands like a more of a satin

all and I did not touch up my makeup like a normally open my compact throughout the night I would touch up my nose in my forehead but I really didn't not really I didn't at all tonight so I think for

love makeup I don't care what you say just sound off below alright let's dive into the video how are you guys first of all how are you it's been a crazy day it's been a crazy week it's been a crazy January is January over yet thank God it is okay let's just plan some makeup now here's the kicker you guys I got a lot of shit on my desk here I have three primers I wish you all were in front of me to pick and do a poll but we can't do that today we have this new primer I found on Sephora called the beauty filter creme glow I mean the name itself makes me want to try it and then we have a pore perfecting primer from Lancer we have a guerrilla blurring active base soothing and blurring effect you guys know I love the soothing but this one caught my eye because it says that it also provides coverage and brightening to the skin tone I don't know what the fuck that's supposed to mean but I kind of want to find out so this is from brand called Sun and I've actually never heard of this brand before so this is kind of cool and interesting so the packaging looks like this it comes in a little jar it actually feels heavy it appears to be glass it feels expensive which is nice and when you open it it comes with this little guy which I'm sure is the spatula of course to remove the product now I don't really care about these I'm just gonna use my finger cuz girl my hands are clean mm-hmm this reminds me of like an ocean vacation let's try the skin and see what the hell happens this feels a little tacky which is great because we all know the foundation is gonna stick um nice now I'm a little confused by the box you all know this is about to be a real first impressions it says that is once it's absorbed into the skin providing coverage and brightening I mean I guess it's a little glowy it also says caution if skin develops abnormal symptoms and side effects such as red spots swelling and itching while using this product please discontinue use I hope that doesn't happen to me so let's dive into some foundation now there's a lot of foundations that just draw and drop recently first of all we're gonna use the new Beauty Blender teal color of course I mean if there's even a new Beauty sponge it's going in today's video oh my god you guys I forgot there's so much thick this is so many products hitting here I'm kind of shook so hourglass recently put out the V vanish flash highlighting sticks okay girl the packaging is so cute you guys know I love the foundation so I've seen people put this on before their foundation and I'm always kind of like does that really work I mean you're literally covering it but it may give us a little glow and you never know so you can use this of course as a highlighter we're gonna put on our face buff for the foundation and let's see what happens [Music] I'm gonna take this actually let's just blend it in a little bit I've seen people do this with the foundation I'm just gonna do this for fun I know a lot of your guy girl what the hell are you even thinking today moving on what shade is I because I don't want you guys to hurt me okay this is gold flash like that name foundation there's a new formula from Dior of course and it is called the Dior skin forever under cover 24-hour wear full coverage fresh weightless foundation high pigment and water-based okay let's do this so I bought four shades and I am going to be mixing ten and fourteen today I'm not sure how full coverage this is it says it is but you know I'm a full coverage bitch so let's just mix and match let's see how this goes on oh is it a lot I don't know we'll see in a minute [Music] I'm a little shocked this foundation looks really nice it's like kind of luminous maybe it's the primer maybe it's the highlighting stick but whatever this combo is I'm definitely liking it this foundation is really pretty for concealer I literally have nothing new I know there's the new makeup revolution concealers everyone's been talking about definitely have to order those but for now I'm like what do I have that's like the latest will go in with the all nighter or waterproof full coverage concealer BAM it looks like this and I've used this in a few videos really loving it it is a very full coverage very brightening and you don't need a lot of product this is one of those formulas where you can like dot it on like this you're all good you don't need to put on like 50 layers now this is a little bit of a quick drying foundation so sometimes I like to take a little artiste brush and just really go in quickly before it dries or you could do Beauty Blender it doesn't matter but this really lays it down quick I am doing a Beautyblender on this side because see it was already like quick-dry so literally you can do like one side blend one side blend because this formula likes to set very quickly which I don't mind because once it sets bitch it ain't moving and now we're gonna finish brightening this face girl so now we are blended to perfection we definitely gotta set this damn full coverage concealer I don't have any new setting powders either I really have been sticking to like what I stick to so for the hundredth time on this channel I'm gonna go in with my lemare the powder one of the best setting powders on the planet and it's just my go-to I can't stop you guys know the drill we're gonna take our damp Beauty Blender and go right in and just press this in to the skin [Music] so I'm gonna dust this off I'm also gonna even set it again for the tenth time with this lemare soft powder I love this it's a literally like probably that in a compact form but its sheer and it just feels so nice all right now I am so excited to dive into the next few items so we are going to use the new natasha de Nona diamond and blush palette look at the packaging so cute now when you open this up you see that there are three creams up top and then three powders so the creams up top are covered by a window so debris and stuff won't really get in there and then the powders are here so instead of doing severe contour I'm gonna do what I used to do in the myspace days and do blush for contour and just really take it there and see how good this formula is now this blush cream I think we should try it with the Beauty Blender of course I love doing cream products with sponges so we're just gonna go in there is pigment on that sponge let's see what happens we're just gonna oh oh oh I'm like excited no I'm not really into cream blushes you guys know I barely use these on my channel now this will probably help the highlighter stick more as well because you know powders and shimmers glimmers glitters love a base like this so I am down know what we're gonna go into the glow cream base I'm literally gonna take the same sponge and let's put this on this is more on the sheer side but I think when the powder goes over this it's gonna be like amazing I'm hoping okay so we actually just got the Anastacio Beverly Hills amber easy brand-new highlighter that drops soon so I think we got to do one side highlighter with Natasha and one side with this one look how pretty this is the packaging is so cute you open it up and look at that glowy wave this packaging is so pretty now I guess this is allegedly a new gel like powder formula that has zero fallout this shade is called highlighter no I think there's really only one shade for their collab it says an illuminating powder with an ultra smooth formula and radiant finish PS amra this is so sickening and we're gonna try it on this side of my face so let's do with this palette first and then we'll dip into that real quickly I want to go into this diamond powder here there's powder blush so maybe we can do that as well okay we got to do it so let's go in here and let's just press a little bit of blush into the skin oh girl I'm going heavy on that fucking blush fuck it so let's dive in on this side let's push the hair back and let's see how the glow is going to look now it says diamond powder and then glow extreme so I'm like okay let's dip into all of them let's do the diamond powder here let's see what this is going to look like okay okay okay Natasha I see you girl and then we're gonna dip into the glow extreme okay she is really cute very almost wet like and I am living let's move on to the amber easy on a stop see a Beverly Hills collaboration highlighter this is so pretty I'm looking at like oh I gotta touch this with my finger that's what I've been dying to do since I just got this like hi oh okay literally no ball out let's go on at the brush and yeah there's like no fall out weird okay let's see how this looks [Music] Wow girl the light is just like capturing that moment like I feel like I'm in the desert with armor right now I was smoking a blunt and bitch this shit is everything Natasha I love you girl this is sickening and then it's like I don't know this is just like smoother or the texture is just like very wet but like let's keep it moving and the next item that I want to do is oh my god okay I am so excited for this let's go directly to eyes girl we're highlighted we have a moment we're not contouring but we're gonna survive it now Oh first of all let's just take a look at this packaging we are going to dive in and play with the brand new Pat McGrath labs mothership for eyeshadow palette the packaging alone was like stunning this eyeshadow palette is very heavy it's luxurious it feels amazing even before opening it I'm like oh the packaging is a very innovative so I already ended it you guys obviously a lot of you so let me swatch this on snapchat and everyone was like where's the video play with it I'm sorry I'm here so when you open it you get this and it just looks like a piece of art it's like unreal now the shade names are in here with all the ingredients which is cool so there's that so here is the mother ship for palette the packaging is so heavy it's full-on like you feel like you bought like a little art piece I love this it's very minimalistic and stunning not when you open it up you do get ten eyes shadows and the pan sizes are very nice so we're just gonna go full on alien and create a really cool look with this palette I love the colors by the way that blue over here that gold right here I'm like don't play me right now of course I prime my lids with the Mac painterly paint-pot in every video so let's just slather this on my lid we're just gonna go ham here and try out some looks so let's go into that beast luxury this shade and if I'm saying this wrong I am so sorry you guys we're gonna gonna dive in with this little brush and we're just gonna go right in here now oh hi I'm just gonna pack this on my lid and see what happens cuz I'm feeling this blue fantasy so I'm just gonna pack this on the lid oh wow [Music] he's like smell good it's almost like I've been now Lauer like creme brulee hmm now we're going to dive into this shade up here called underworld and we're just going to take a little blending brush right here I'm just going to flick up and out a little bit and we're just gonna go like this I love this look I'm like mmm yummy now I think I'm going to dip and I don't know yet you guys are nervous Devine mink is speaking to me like this one is everything you guys I'm just gonna take this brush just a little bit oh yeah girl give me the pigment and I'm gonna just blend it in here and just give it kind of a little I'm literally just taking this and like smudging it up like oh girl alright now I just got to get the inner corner out of the way I've been dying to play with this gold standard shade so let's just hit this a few times because don't need any fix plus these literally need a brush which is shocking so I'm gonna just tuck this right in here and layer it over the blue and then drag it in the inner corner oh my god girl the gold is looking full of this now I'm gonna take my little Mac smolder eye pencil and quickly do some black liner in the waterline and now I'm gonna go in with a little pencil brush and dip into blue blood and we're just going to dab this along the lash line and then add a little bit of more drama to complete this eye look just to be really extra we're gonna dip into this beautiful shade or right here I mean look at that color I'm like hi and I'm literally just gonna barely touch it we're just gonna kind of use this to smoke out and cause some drama right under here and we're just gonna go like this I'm feeling a little avant-garde right now I'm feeling like I need to be on the runway oh I love the undertone I actually want to put this all over my whole lid and let's blend it together so what pretty don't you love me like get a palette and you're actually just like re-inspired to like play in your makeup like that's how I'm feeling right now now I think it's time for a little bit of lashes and some love now I do have this new Burberry mascara what is this called you all this is the jet-black number one Burberry Kat lashes now it looks like this of course and the wand when you pull it out it is looking like this let me show ya interesting now is this gonna work who the fuck knows what we're about to see let's coat our lashes first it feels a little weird but like it worked good I actually like easy peasy this mascara I'm like damn this shit is cute my bottom lashes look really nice and full I know we're about to cover the top with lashes but I'm actually really impressed I new Burberry is a little on the pricey side as well but bitch you know I'm a luxury ho and this was great now we need some lashes now I don't really have any new lashes that just hit the market but girl I got this House of lashes Pro Edition a last story book this is probably been sitting in my makeup room for months and when you open it up you get the glue which ones do we want to do today oh girl look at them Cecile's though like ooh what siren all right I'm just gonna pull out a random pair this siren looks really pretty right here and let's just see how they look actually that pair was not dramatic enough so we're gonna go in with this lash in its to seal and I think this will be a little more like uh I'm gonna go in with the House of lash glue which I really could use it a few times but it's been a minute so we're just gonna coat the entire lash band all right let's see how these ones look the lashes are on there pretty they're dramatic and I think they fit perfect with this look we're almost to the finish line now there's some things actually forgot to use which I'm kind of mad at myself I had this eye cream to use this is literally a banana bright eye cream with vitamin C with collagen hotha try this tomorrow morning um I'm looking at what else I had had a new moisturizer oh no man Nicole use a saw me Bobbi Brown okay sorry this is not an ad oh this new setting spray I have seen this everywhere Ulta this is the facial spray with aloe chamomile and lavender baby oh just like wakes you up all right now lip oh I'm excited about lip now if you guys thought Pat McGrath was gonna slay with the eye I know I ever viewed her lipsticks on my channel where she just released a whole new spring collection so I'm like we're gonna do more Pat no I do have some lip glosses from girl on maybe we'll throw on top but girl Pat McGrath made a lip balm and I first saw my girl okay like you better slow it down but the packaging wins me over every time so this lip balm looks like this and I kind of love the bullet form instead of a second or much chapstick this one is like ultra hydrating let's try it I'm like it smells so yummy okay now I thought it was gonna be kind of like waxy it's so smooth it's like oh it's so hydrating okay I'm like this is going

a lot of people are like what would Nichole do I'm like well let's ask her keep Matt use mostly matte colors which is great because there's a bunch of them in a lot of Matt's in this palette you're

it work do it right a lot of practice and what okay we're gonna add some pink to this eye shake a little bit cavity a the bright pink and the palette I love this it's like a purpley pink it's

huh bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we're going to talk about espionage and self sucking no we're actually going to dive it's just some crazy ass shit here girl I have been seeing everyone on YouTube talk about review try and attempt to work out the MAC Cosmetics roller wheel liquid liner now when I first saw this online I was like wow okay like of course my gut which a cutting pizza because I saw the applicator and I was like girl Pizza Hut stuffed crust with pepperoni cinnamon sticks with extra icing and boneless wings I don't know about anyone else so I got a whole pamphlet here y'all we're going to talk about this crazy liner MAC Cosmetics did send me this PR and I'm like okay I'm kind of not really excited by Mac lately I don't know about anyone else but this caught my attention because it is something that I've never really seen before I don't know Mac's been a little stagnant lately I think there was just so many releases from other brands and there's so many new companies coming up Mac you better step the fuck up we are going to attempt to try out this liner I got two shades here today we have on a roll black and roller Royale I already have my makeup done I was reviewing the Sephora mosquito collection and girl show was bombed so I'm like you know what let me just sit down here and Travis liners so if you want to see if they work or not keep on watching so this part says as 0.3 fluid ounces in here ok I don't even know if that's a lot for a liner I'm about to go look ok oh wow ok so when you pull out of the box it looks like this the applicator is very long but then as the grooves in it for your fingers I'm going to assume so you have a nice tight grip alright so let's open her up oh wow ok so it kind of just pops off like a lid and oh my god okay first of all in person this is so tiny let me hold up my hand so you guys can really see how tiny the wheel is holy shit I've watched one other person's review and it did not look this tiny like on camera I don't know how it looks to you guys and then look it is thin let me just do a little turn so you guys can see it that is razor thin Wow here's what the inside of the component looks like where the product is and I guess if you want to get more product on the wheel we'll call it you have to dunk it in again so let's just see what the hell this is supposed to do okay so the fact sheet says Mac reinvent the wheel with our roller wheel liquid liner a ground-breaking spinning disc applicator absorbs the perfect amount of product to provide a continuous smooth even stroke of color skinny lined and defined a wing effect or a bold geometric look let the rolling applicator do all the work for the perfect liquid line every time being high roller on hot wheels with a roller okay girl I get it these are going to retail for 21 dollars a piece of course I have two colors here but there are two more shades coming that is a oh okay there's a shiny black and a matte black which one do we have we have the matte black thank God and then there is the warm brown and of course we have the blue here oh yeah knowing you guys this is going to be online August 17 and in stores September 14 so literally almost a month later you'll be in stores that's kind of weird let's get into the damn review and see if he's higher obviously I don't have any false lashes on I just have on the benefit a roller lash mascara yeah we're just going to go in here and see if this works I'll just do like a line first and then maybe we'll have some fun so I guess let's take this wheel face thing alright so we're going to take this and [Music] let me tell my head you guys let's see if we can get a better look here [Music] okay that is what we have so far I mean that was quick okay I don't know about anyone else but when I'm doing a liner I hold my breath so I'm like so excuse me if I'm not talking while I am wheeling okay I think I need a little bit more product because it is getting a tiny bit streaky but when I did it that first time right away it definitely didn't skip so let me dunk it again and let's see what happens okay I mean that was not that bad all right I'm dunking in for a third time now let's try to flick this out [Music] she's looking a little fucked it I just fucked if his shit up okay definitely for trying it out the first time it is a little difficult because when you turn the thing a little bit it could get product like that where I thought that was the straight line but I turned it too much and it got like wonky so let me try to roll some more now I will say this it doesn't feel bad isn't hurt or feel like weird or anything the wheel is smooth the applicator feels a nice we're definitely taking it there with the wing when she says she's just doing a subtle wedding look this is what happened definitely something that you have to get a hang like get the hang of it's not like okay BAM this is easy but it's a little tricky now I did kind of straighten it out it is very dramatic but I can't look for it and just for fun I want to take the wheel and just see what happens if I go into my crease right here oh wow see yeah it's a little messy you guys if you don't if you're not careful doesn't like go completely straight you do have to kind of manipulate it I think it's like I'd rather just take a liner brush and just do it quickly because girl I just fucked up this makeup now that I sucked up this side look at that shit you guys what is going on this is shade roller Royale and oh my god it's hugging brightest blue so I figure do you know what let's see if this works your suit I mean it's skip and the pigment is really not there I'm just mapping out where my chicken plants are going to go don't mind me [Music] as you see you guys the wheel it can be fun when you have like 10 hits off the ball and you're just trying to live the wheel works when you're trying to really slay a liner I don't fucking know but it will tell you this okay the product feels thick like when this is dry right here in my eye my eye feels heavy this on my mouth feels thick like bizarre actually I'm like all right like Laura Lee would say I think this product might be a little gimmicky only thing I did not like about it well there's a few things I wish that the pigment was like embedded into the wheel so it had continuous non-stop coverage from it so you can have to continuously keep dunking because as you saw I mean all jokes aside obviously I just paint all over my face but as you go down it was just really hard to keep a straight line I think there has to be a lot of practice sometimes when you try something new you're not really going to love it I'll definitely have to try this out a few board times but the way the applicator just kind of didn't stay consistent and wouldn't mean by that when you're it's that close to your eye and you're trying to look at yourself right I'm just going to it on my hand it was hard to see like okay there was one right but it was hard to turn it or even try to make a line opaque it's just kind of a little hard to get a hold of so not my favorite thing in the world definitely love that Mac made something innovative and new I think that the makeup industry can be a little stale sometimes I mean what else can people make when there is so much else out there so props to them for coming up with something new if you want to try or give it a whirl obviously try yourself but this was my experience now let me call my doctor I have some fucking shit to fix yes hahaha how do I look you look pretty crazy looks like a surgeon just drawing your face okay Ted oh yeah I'm gonna get all this done and hopefully will be healed by the weekend all right you guys thank you for watching another review about to go what do we love to do I need to go I don't even know we need to go relax a long day that sure has all right you guys thank you for watching some makeup debauchery we'll see you next see you guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel I literally leave town for a few days I've been at Michigan for like three days over the weekend and the Internet has gone fucking crazy the beauty community is up in arms everyone is gossiping talking and I'm like girl this is this is all about I shadow I need to see what the hell is going on so of course today we are talking about the subculture eyeshadow palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills now consistently they have been a really great brand over the last few years they have turned into a small brand into a fucking empire with an entire range of products I was dawn I loved on yesterday the internet was going nuts people were just talking about all these crazy reviews on YouTube and there's so many mixed reviews on this some people are like oh my god it's the best thing ever some people think it's the worst thing ever and I'm like over some damn makeup so I'm like you know what let me take a dip into this palette and I really appreciate that so many of you are tweeting me and hitting me up on Instagram and snapchat and you're like Geoffrey review this subculture palette we want to know what the real T is so today we are going to play with this and create an eye look of course I already have my foundation down let's get into this damn review so if you want to see me test out the subculture palette to keep on watching this palette retails for $42 to think about the modern renaissance palette which is probably their top selling palette to date it is such a staple and a lot of people's you know make a collection and what they use day to day I did a review on this palette like a year ago when it first came out and it has just turned into a really like a staple and a lot of people's looks people love this damn palette so I pulled a baby out and I remembered the quality of it because so many people were like okay Jeffrey we want to know what you think is it the same as this or the same consistency and I'm like oh my god I haven't played with this and so long so I dipped into it today I went back and I watched my review and I'm like okay I'm educated on what the hell is going on let's try the other palette you do get 13 brand new shades in this palette one of them is they repeat so there are 14 shades but shade fudge is a I think it's a single shadow in the collection here is the color selection I'm just going to pop it this brush out now the brush did come with it so once I landed today I'm like why is everyone going so hard on this and being so extra or are they being extra I don't know we're about to find out so I did take the brush that came with it and I kind of went in on the color new wave this kind of like orange color here and I'm like okay what is going on people knew yes I did notice there was some fallout and we're going to do some zoom ins I'm going to show you everything I obviously haven't tested any other shade except that when I kind of hit it with this side and I'm like okay of course I do want to prime my eyes like I always do with every review I like to be consistent so of course you guys I do have a little bit of foundation on my lids now I'm going to go in with the Mac painterly paint-pot and I'm just going to take a little synthetic flat brush and just coat my lids with this just like I do with every tutorial normally before I review something I never watch anyone elses reviews because I don't want to ever be biased or like okay well maybe they liked it how come I don't ever like to watch anyone's reviews but girl the internet was going crazy this weekend so I literally sat and I watched like 10 reviews and I'm like okay girl some people had a really hard time some people it worked amazing for and I'm like girl what the fuck at the end of the day it's just eyeshadow and people are acting like it is literally World War 3 I get it you know people spend their hard-earned damn money on makeup and they want to make sure that it works so whenever there's like an inconsistency or anything crazy the internet goes nuts nowadays now some people do like to be overly dramatic I know you guys are all looking at me like I mean you know it's all about personal preference of what that really means I think some people try too hard to get a reaction from a brand or to get like attention online we've definitely seen that with the Jaqueline palette people be lying and shit but this one I saw some crazy shit online so I'm like you know what I need to try this for myself alright let's zoom into this palette I'm going to show you how much fallout there is if there's any and let's just do a little zoom in all right so I'm going to take the brush that came with the palette and we're just going to knock into Roxy so there is a one two three and that is what happened and here is what is on the brush now I'm going to knock this off a little bit and let's see if you can see it oh girl let's just glue all over my damn Gucci are they powdery this shade is so far let me go in with another clean brush we'll just do this little blending brush and let's hit shade NuWave now that is how I would normally dip into a palette so you see yes there is a lot of kickback the brush is completely coated now let's once again hit this off and let's see what happens okay let me show it one more time so we are going to dip into there and you see there is a lot on this brush the bristles are black and let's just do it one more time you see that they are powdery which you know a lot of eyeshadow palettes are powdery is it going to blend out that's really what's most important to me so now that we've gotten that out of the way tis a powdery clearly it is does it blend we're about to find out so let's take the shade NuWave right here that we already dipped into I'm just going to take the same brush this is a little Cosette blending brush I'm just going to SPI lightly dip into my pans and that's what you get so let's see how this looks on the eye of course because that is the real question I need a little mirror here here we go alright I'm taking shade and NuWave and I am just going to place this or right into my crease I mean that's pigmented Looch okay now I'm going to take a little witchy brush I love to take this with no shadow and just kind of go up and blend any like lines to make them really seamless in airbrush so let's do that right now alright we're going to go in one more time I'm going to go in with the brush I was a very light handed girl lord have mercy just going to tilt my head back a little bit and let's just pop that right in the crease all right now we're going to go in with this really cool mustard a yellow shade called edge so I'm going to take this and just dip into here and I'm being very light and you can see she's powdery okay cool let's see what happens all right moving on we are going to take shade all-star it is this maroon color up top so let's go and I'm barely touching the brush and it gets coated like shake that off a little bit and let's see what happens I'm going to go in a little bit more now I'm going to take that just kind of move it up into my crease and I'm just going to buff this out for some inner Rama all right now obviously these lines are a little harsh so I'm going to go in with the blending brush that I used earlier as no product on it except a little residue from all-star and I am just going to now soften that line now I do want to go back in with this brush and we're going to hit new wave one more time so I'm going to go in you guys and just kind of go over the darkness and just try to soften that now I've seen so many people asked like we want to know how the hell these blend out I've seen a lot of people that are having problems blending them together there's like streakiness or patchiness so I am going to look closely and I will see this the shadows like they're not skipping but I feel like right here it's like really really dark and then there's kind of like almost like a little gap so I'm just going to take some more shadow from the brush tuck it in here okay it's kind of weird to me only because like tell me if I'm psychotic or not but like right here it almost appears like let me tell my head back darker and then it's a little lighter right in there or am I just losing my mind here see like look some a room like maroon e red there and then it like got darker I mean maybe because of the orange shadow it's like girl we do not want to play well together not really sure so I started to do this side of the eye and I'm kind of having the same problem where I actually love how the color looks down here but mixed with the orange it just got kind of really weird so I'm going to tilt my head all the way back you can see I know it's a little messy I am going to do a little concealer and cut out some of the color yeah I'm like not loving this like to me it seems like this almost turned like a blackish gray right here and then where the color was by itself it's fine which is so bizarre to me like let me try to load or on air I'm packing I'm packing yeah that looks like the color and then as soon as it mixed with the new wave and edge it got darker I'm a girl I did not put black and my mother's I'll be great so I M tripped out a little bit right now I really am dying to try like these metallic colors right here so I'm going to use a little bit of the tart shaped Cape concealer and we are going to do a little we're going to cut out some of that product and give my eye a little moment now the trick is to go in honey and do not worry about it so I'm going to take this and just put it right there all right so I'm going to take the color all-star one more time and I'm just going to kind of put it right where the concealer is and just kind of create a little bit of a blending now what in the mother fuck is going on look at my eye why does it turn so like it almost looks black like it does not look like the color I was just using I literally have used this the whole entire time we're going to go in again okay you see it now I'm going to go over here and let's just see if that happens over here see it like looks Burgundy Marone and then for some reason it's like I don't understa Saar I'm like trip out now I'm actually feeling like I'm in the twilight zone I'm like I'm like listen I'm like I'm sober I'm not even high aren't you guys we're just going to a keep it moving now my eye is all right I'm try to fix it add a little bit more I don't know why I'm like is the color oxidizing is that the brush is it the concealer I'm not really sure I've never really had to top in before but now that the concealer is on there I am dying to try this crazy I mean I'm wearing a whole especially hmm so electric looks to be like it's beautiful like almost like a shifty green yellow so I want to put that over where the concealer was now people always are weird about when you doing the review with the metallics I always will wet the brush with six plus or any setting spray go in the pan and then the eye but of course we are doing a little review today so let me go in with a dry brush just that we're all the same page this brush has no moisture I am going to dip in here so let's do that okay so there's really no fallout with that color yeah it's not really sticking onto my brush let's see what it looks like or right here the intensity for me is not really there let me go in one more time and do a second layer it's really subtle like obviously you guys can see okay where is my X plus now which is a morphic spray it's literally my favorite setting spray so we're just going to wet the brush so we're going to go in here now that's wet okay a lot more pigment on the brush let's go to the eye and let's put this bitch on it's pretty not really like obsessed with it I was hoping for like a like holy s metallic moment I'm going to go back in with this brush real quick and it's kind of blending these two together now I used this all-star color for all over the lid obviously you guys have been watching this I have not dipped into the dark shade or a V yet and for some reason it's like dark right here and then it goes back to being the color and when I put it in the crease it turned a really dark almost like a plum gray black color which I didn't do on my eye so I'm like I'm really tripping out right now alright so I'm going to take a little Tom Ford pencil brush and I'm going to dip it shade let's do untamed it is like a green color and I'm just going to dip into there okay you see it coated the brush completely let's see how this looks [Music] now I'm being really gentle with how I blend this out I'm being really like I'm like kind of barely touching the skin and I'm going to just a layer moving on I am going to take a little bit more bun tame we're just going to go today Q now a lot of times I love to take a brush we'll just use the one that came with the palette and I like to go in with a lighter shade like NuWave so I like to take the shade or something like this and just kind of barely touch under it just so it kind of gives it some kind of artsy weird depth to it and we're going to go into and tame barely like I'm just kind of barely in the pan and then we're going to just blend these together all right you guys the bottom is done and girl I feel like I look a fucking hot mess like I am a little shook to the ground right now I am not loving my eyes okay we are going to try one more color alright now when I first saw this palette I was really excited for this top shade cube up here it's like a white beard iridescent type of metallic shade but it has like a pink shift to it and when I first saw it reminded me of the pink heart highlighter and a moon child glow kit which is one of my favorite palettes I love this color it's going to take another little pointer brush from Cosette and I'm going to go right into this pan here let's see what happens okay okay so you see it's coating the brush now let's see what it looks like in the inner corner that's what I want to see okay so you do see some payoff now this brush is dry of course as you all saw I wish it was a little more intense I will wet it in a second I just want to do both sides equally okay running bad okay we're going to wet hair real quickly let's dip in here again and here we go with the wet brush oh wow that really coated that nicely so let's go in and let's see how it looks now okay it's a little more subtle than I thought like on camera I think with all the beauty lights is definitely reflecting it's just not as like varium as I thought it was going to be but it is pretty I do like the shift to it are you guys I think I've played with enough colors in this palette to give my final thoughts I do quickly want to throw on some mascara I am just going to go in with I just reviewed this - let's give it a whirl actually really like this the L'Oreal lash paradise it is cute not as good as that benefit one bitch but she ain't bad so let me just quickly put on some mascara and I'll be right back alright you guys I am ready to give you my final soft mascara is on and I'm looking in the monitor and I'm like girl even with all these Beauty lights I'm not feeling that I feel messy is that weird just past messy like no tea no shade there is pigment on my brushes there is fallout all over my makeup station my hands are a mess the shirt girl who's gonna pay for my dry-cleaning bill it's messy that's just a no-brainer as you can see also something I didn't like with modern renaissance is the cells I know a lot of you love this soft touch but for someone that travels a lot it just gets like kind of messy quickly I almost wish it was like a leather or like something else but there's like brush hairs there's eyeshadow on here and it's kind of hard to remove because it is like that felt kind of like pool table type of feel so let's open the palette let's see what it looks like after I have finished with it now I did blow off all the fallout you can see in the cracks in here and you can just see how it all looks alright so these are called bold metallics on the back and I feel like these two were not like bold they were not screaming in your face metallic it was a lot of work too these show up on my lids even with concealer lay down my eyes were not really having it of course the cube color did show up here kind of but I'm like girl not as great as I wanted it to sorry I keep licking the monitor on micro all-star that color I don't know why it definitely oxidized on my crease like in there and on it it definitely did like I'm sitting here looking and I'm like what is this like this is like a dark streak going up and then it turns back into the color and I'm like girl I told me you sad need index to the dark web so that is definitely weird to me it's tripping me out now maybe it's my fault is it the concealer did the colors not want to go together but normally when you blend colors together they don't turn a color like that or that extreme so that tripped me out the fallout of course we've mentioned a million times it has extreme fallout definitely I think more fallout than the modern renaissance palette I select this formula maybe is a little better I'm not sure if they change something I saw so many people look at the ingredients and compare them and they said that they were different I know a lot of you mentioned that mica was the first ingredient in this for all the shadows and then you flip this over and it says talc is the main ingredient and there is no mica right after it which a lot of brands usually it says mica talc or calc mica whatever the hell this one does not say mica after it obviously I'm not a chemist but I don't know if that has something to do with it untamed was probably one of the least fallout of shades it wasn't that bad it looks nice under my eyes it's a little not like my favorite thing in the world but it was a nice new wave oh my god girl it like it was a mess it was a little messy I will have to say that be honest Ostia Beverly Hills sub-culture eyeshadow palette is not Jeffrey star [Music] I just kind of too much trouble with it and I didn't love it I really didn't love it you know when you like go into something wanting to love it you're like girl all these people are crazy and for once I'm a little shocked that I'm kind of agreeing with everyone I do not like how this blended like I'm kind of mad at myself and I want to wipe it off and like do it again but girl I literally do the same routine every single time you guys know me by now it's the same song and dance and it's the same steps and this palette did not work for me of course I am seeing a lot of people online and on Instagram that are loving it obviously makeup is makeup and we all have our own experiences take away from this review whatever you want this was just my opinion my thoughts and my experience I definitely do not love it and I'm like girl I don't know what and the hell is going on over here but my eyes were not feeling it overall it was kind of a Miss for me so let me know your thoughts down below sound off what the hell do you think do you think I don't know what do you think of waiting about a damn tutorial so let me know in the comment section down below yeah that's it for today you guys thank you so much for watching this review and I will see you on the next one 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I have a pimple and I don't know if I want to live anymore alright so let's address the elephant in the room for the first time on my channel maybe the second time ever I have a pimple yes sometimes I am a human being I tried three foundations this past weekend and my skin said bitch what the hell let's not do that ever again so today we are going to be testing out some brushes inspired by the movie Mean Girls y'all know I've been a huge Mean Girls fan since at the beginning that is one of my favorite movies I used to sell hats for my clothing line a few years ago and it said of the plastics but I also have a Regina George highlighter from my brand so when I saw these brushes were coming out I was like whoa Lord Jesus I order them immediately and I think there are actually out of stock now we're gonna hop on the website in a second and check but we're going to test those out today so if you want to see if these crazy brushes at work they keep on watching so this brand is called a spectrum when I saw this float around on trend mood on Instagram shout-out to you hey girl and on the internet I was like I have never heard of this brand this is so crazy and at first I was like is this real because I'm like why would Mean Girls license out their brand to Indy brand not that's a bad thing I think it's really cool that they got the license but I pictured like a Mac or someone crazy doing a Mean Girls collab but here we are with this indie brand so as you see we have the little emblem on here we have the detailing and this is like V burn book we all know we've seen the movie if you haven't seen the movie you might want to pause this video go watch it and then come back and talk to me so when you buy the brush set there are several options this brand is giving you on their website right you can buy the burn book by itself which is of course then a just a brush holder you can buy the brush holder with all the brushes inside of it and that retails for a 94 99 so that is what I bought today it's a little pricey but then you are getting a full wou leather case with a strap by the way I do want to mention that this does have a strap with kiss marks on the back if you just want to buy the book by itself or the brush is so low without this that is both 64 and 99 so I think right now the brush that with the brushes and the case they're they're sold out right now you guys but I'm sure they're gonna restock because this is a hot item let's open her up and let's see what the hell you get here is the brushes I'm gonna hold them up like this so they hold its easel there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten look at me counting on camera all right so you get ten brushes I'm actually take this out this is a removable pouch I don't really like pouches in my stuff I don't mind just the brushes so here is what you get now of course these are synthetic brushes on the website it says that it is the highest quality synthetic which of course we're gonna try a few of these brushes out on the face today I can't wait to put on foundation let's go on the website and see what exactly you're supposed to get in this kit all right so I'm gonna take some of these brushes out I'm gonna assume what a lot of these are so I'm assuming this is a foundation brush of course to apply foundation each brush does have a quote on it this one says she doesn't even go here so if you've seen that movie of course you all know the famous quotes are very cute and very kitschy now just from looking on Spectrum's website they obviously make other brushes which I didn't know that so I think some of the brushes or the styles that they already sell are going to come in this so they're all numbered of course okay we got a fan brush you can do contour with this you can do a highlight I mean you can really go in on this one now the brushes do feel soft they feel a little plastic II of course synthetic is going to feel that way since it is not real hair but it doesn't feel bad like when I fill this it isn't like you know some of the drugstore brands y'all have felt some synthetic shit and you're like oh this one feels soft but a little plasticky not you not too bad it feels nice I'm just gonna pull out all of them where does this one say you can walk home bitches oh so I sat here you guys and I'm like overall I don't know why I feel like the brushes are giving me a little bit of a Lisa Frank vibe maybe it's the purple when I think of Mean Girls I think of like everything pink black white I don't really think of purple so it's I think it's a cute idea I thought to myself okay what can you really do with Mean Girls with brushes I mean there's not that much to do so I'm not mad at these I'm just not like obsessed with them they look a little like more childlike instead of like I don't know I just wish they looked a little more bitchy a little more princess a little more Kunti no see like that no purple huh I love others look we're moving on all right so I think I need some foundation on my skin you guys so I'm going to go in with some of my favorite no poor bloom primer from touch and soul so I'm just gonna put this on my skin and let's see what happens all right now we're gonna go in with one of my favorite foundations the new YSL all ours I have been using this for a few months now and this might be in my favorites coming up because a bitch is hooked so I like to mix two shades sometimes brands just don't make your exact facial color that's sometimes a lot of the times I'm gonna go in with a be 20 and then we're gonna go and be 40 and do a little mixing now a lot of the times you guys all just go like this I like the high pimple and by pimple huh what if it just doesn't cover you guys it's like oh let's take this brush of course this is a foundation brush this is the B is 0-1 and let's see how this handle is my skin [Music] first impressions while we blend it definitely like let's the product distribute thickly which I love because I am a full coverage Queen so so far so good let me buff out this forehead so I don't look crazy anymore sometimes a product will get eaten into the brush or it will blend a little weird you never know a synthetic quality of what you're gonna get but so far I'm actually pleasantly surprised because this is putting it on really nicely so I'm just going to buff this in and we will see how I look alright so let's take a little zoom in look this brush applied the foundation it very nicely now twice L it's a full coverage type of liquid so yeah the foundation that's were really really nice okay so we're gonna move on now and let's try out I had a lot of brushes here cuz I definitely want to try to do some concealer there's not really a concealer brush here it's so oh okay well we do have this so okay we're gonna take a little bit of some Tarte shape tape for a second let's put some on here alright now I'm just gonna use the same foundation brush and we're gonna see if this works for concealer now obviously you guys this is not a concealer brush but I know a lot of people who just use the same brush for foundation now you guys know I love a good beauty blender so I normally do not do this but look at her buffing out all pretty what's uh now to set the concealer we are going to use this brush right here this is the a 21 brush so we're gonna go into the little Laura Mercier powder I'm just gonna go directly in and put some of this all over now you guys see it is on the brush let's go directly under the eye [Music] something that I've also been doing lately is after I've set the concealer or whatever I want to do instead with my face I go in with the venti Beauty this is the Universal Bellotti powder a girl this makes your skin look like blurry I don't know why or what is in this but I'm obsessed with this so after I set the skin I'll go in with this powder and then I'll put it right on top just for like an extra little like hmm alright now we're gonna take this crazy fan brush which a lot of people use for contour you can you can use it for a lot of things highlighting foundation so we're gonna go in with some bronzer here and a little bit of contouring we're gonna go in with the KK beauty kit and let's open her up now I like to mix and match so I will go in like this and I'll just kind of go back and forth okay now that has a lot of product on there so we're gonna knock a little bit of it off and let's see if my cheekbones want to carve out today oh my god let's take off some of the product and let's try buffing this out okay now they weren't lying about these bristles because this put it that was a little shedding which is normal for synthetics I'm not mad at that this product applies really easy to the skin is it blending good on camera yeah it actually ain't too bad you guys I was a little scared I put too much but now that this is buffed out hmm I'm liking it okay so let's be a little more a light-handed for the other side jesus take the wheel now we're gonna take a little bit of Chanel powder and kind of set the rest of my face and go around the contour make sure it's really soft and we are going to go in with this guy va0 one and let's see how it works now the contour went on really nicely okay you can tell this has some product on there and I like to just kind of go around the contour and make sure it is flawless [Music] voila alright you guys so after oh wow after looking at clothes right now I'm like okay these brushes are actually killing it and I'm shook alright let's try the highlighting brushes well one of them is definitely a highlighting brush it is this guy right here I don't know why it looks like it's crying right here it kind of fell over but this is how it looked when I opened the box so we're gonna try out this little guy today and we're also going to use this one you're like really pretty so we are going to use this one for a cream highlighter and this one for a powder alright so first we're gonna take this guy which you could have used for contouring a really sharp line as well but we are going to use it for a little cream contour we're gonna go in with the Stila heavens hue highlighter and shade kitten it looks something like this it is a putty highlighter if you've never seen this before I reviewed this on my channel a few months ago so we're just going to take this and we're just gonna go right into this highlighter and let's see-oh somes on there okay now this is a blinding highlighter if we all remember from the review she worked this is a Jeffrey's or approved moment so let's see how blinding we're gonna get today we'll do some all over the brow since we have no eyebrows today this brush put this highlighter on really pretty now we're going to go in to the jeffree star cosmetics a Uranus highlighter my collab of course with mani MUA she looks something like this yes she's been swatched let's go in here and let's see what happens [Music] I don't really like fan brushes anymore for highlighters but I swear to lower Jesus this one is really cute not that this is a bad thing but like y'all spectrum really came through with these brushes I did not know what to expect there is a few brushes left I mean we tried most of them on the reel we've tried all of these now I think I can obviously y'all know what I'm gonna say you know I like these brushes already now there are a few eye shadow brushes and there is a lip brush course already have lipstick on and I know a lot of you're gonna be like what is it it is the pink print lipstick which is the clap from Nicki Minaj and Mac and of course just put some uranus on top I don't even know why I mean you touch this up it stayed on throughout this whole video already so we do have some eye shadow brushes I could take a dip real quick and see if they work but I'm gonna assume and that they work so let's pull out the androgyny palette and let's just put in a little bit of safe word and let's see what happens BAM like all these like brushes really blend out the product I am like a little shocked at that there hasn't been one that I'm like I mean it's alright it's like you don't want to blend some motherfucking eyeshadow here we are this blended out really pretty so I mean I don't even think we need to pause and say what are my final thoughts y'all know my final thoughts the spectrum mean girl collaboration brushes are amazing they blend it out like a dream and I can't believe it y'all know I do beauty blenders only for my foundation and this brush really like it satisfies my needs is it a little pricey yes but you do get the whole kit and caboodle you get this you can use this as a book bag or a chain or to hide your weed in it I don't know what the hell y'all want to do with this but it's definitely cute and the brushes worked like there's no other way to say except they worked they were great so if you want an entire set or you're on the fence and you maybe want some new brushes definitely check these out I think 10 brushes plus the kit wood that carries them all it's you know you're you are you are gonna pay for like kind of like a little collector's item in the makeup world so I think this is a cute idea the packaging was not my favorite on earth but it's still pink so anything pink I'm gonna buy alright you guys I will definitely use these in future videos and um yeah bitch I'm like Dan about highlight though what girl get your sunglasses ain't going anywhere thank you so much for watching another review these brushes are Jeffrey's are approved are you 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel you see this brush yes the day has finally came where I am about to do a full face using only NYX products holy shit I know a lot of you are out there looking at your watches like girl my hair is turning gray um I know it's been a while I did a Ulta I didn't all the whole video a few months ago and then I did a full face using only Maybelline products which I bought in Malta and then I also bought hundreds of NYX products and they've been sitting here for a month or two I played around with a few but then there's also new stuff that just dropped and I'm like oh my god so before I even shot this video I'm like I'm gonna have to get the new stuff or everyone at home it's gonna slap me so today we are going to do everything NYX - some of the brushes because I did get some but I didn't get a entire set or collection so we'll just have to pick and choose we have morphe brushes we have a bunch of stuff and that is that before we dive into the video let me just say a few things if you guys don't mind I am really really excited because September 9th is around the corner and finally me and Manny anyway are restocking our collaboration and not only are we restocking the infamous bundle but we are revamping the packaging here's a little sneak peek of the inside and we are bringing back the Eclipse skin frost highlighter but if you buy the bundle which this retails for only $50 you get a brand new highlighter and what is that highlighter it's called a Uranus and it is a very beautiful striking pale gold so if you get the bundle you get the brand new highlighter it will also be available individually so both skin Frost's are returning as well as daddy and I'm shocked liquid lipsticks so if you want to get the bundle or anything on part of this collection September 9th 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on jeffree star cosmetics calm I am really really stoked for everyone to see this and here's a little sneak peak of Uranus I know me and Manny have posted it all over Instagram by now it is so buttery my finger is just like bling-bling it's really pretty so I'm just gonna do a little swatch right here so you guys can see what Uranus looks like oh my god honey now of course I will not be using us in today's video we're doing full face NYX only but before we dive into the video I am really excited to announce that this video does have a crazy giveaway I am giving away not one not two not three but five separate Ulta gift cards and they all will have 500 bucks on them here are the rules you must leave a comment down below and be subscribed to my channel now this giveaway does end September 11th so be sure to check back in the description box to see the winners I will of course damn you on Instagram or hit you up on youtube if you win so besides that you guys let's dive in to the video so NYX has so many damn primers when I bought everything to do this video I stopped there and I'm like oh my god I don't know which one to use we have the honey do me up which everyone said was a kind of a dupe for the crazy expensive grill on gold primer it looks very similar in here now of course NYX is a very drugstore and affordable which is amazing so many of you have asked why I've never really used their products on my channel and I haven't really just played with the brand I know there's just so many brands out there you guys really push me to try it so thank you besides that we have the studio perfect photo loving primer then we have the classic og angel veil primer I know a lot of you have been using us for a while and then we have the hor filler it creates a satiny smooth finish minimizing the appearance of enlarged pores I'm like should I use this and the gold one maybe I think we should try them out I mean if we have all these sitting here we got to use a few of them so let's see if we can get some primer out oh it looks like a little like peach type of color so I don't know how this is going to work so I like to go kind of minimal on let's just put on my nose and my poor area so I'm just gonna Pat that in let me take this honey do me up and oh it's like a little spatula whoa this looks like I'm not gonna say it alright so I'm just gonna take this and we're gonna put it over all the areas where we did not put the pore filler all right our face is primed and now we're gonna move on to foundation I have been hearing so many mixed reviews about the total control drop foundation now these came out while ago I didn't get a chance to review them yet and well the day is here so here we are so we are just going to give this a shake of course this says that it can be sheer to full coverage I know most of you out there are like bitch I already tried this well I haven't so let's see what happens all right here we go everybody oh my god now I'm gonna do one side first because I'm not sure what the hell is going to happen and is that too much is that too little y'all know my full coverage so let's see here goes nothing okay well I definitely look like a Casper the Friendly Ghost mama I need some more drops all right we are blended into perfection now I do think that this foundation is not bad I had no idea what to think as I started to blend it out it was a little thin it felt like weird it was definitely a interesting texture that I hadn't really experienced before but looking closely it's not bad I almost feel like I had even more coverage and I know that you can add more and more drops but I like how my skin's looking I think the primer didn't do a bad job all right you guys let's move on now concealer are we ready to conceal I'm ready to fucking conceal there are two options I have this concealer corrector and contour little brick here and then I also have a this is the HD studio photogenic concealer I don't know which one is thicker I know everyone at home is probably already knowing the answers to this I'm gonna go on with this first and here we go is this light enough for me we shall see all right so this is blended out not bad it seems a little light from me which it almost like kind of blended in with the foundation you guys see a big like a big difference I don't really I almost want to try it a little bit in here girl what shade is gonna be light enough for me in here this is this is the lightest one we're gonna see about that let me just take this oh my god okay I think this one is maybe a little more hydrating on this side from the brick and then the one by itself it's kind of like not doing that much so I'm just gonna go back in and put a little bit more on this side bitch give me some damn cuff before we dive into contour I do want to use this HD finishing powder hopefully it does not give me any flashback I am going to use this with a what kind of brush we going you say what's a little kabuki brush and let's see what happened now I think you can use this to set your whole face I'm going to assume translucent finishing powder softens the appearance of fine lines and pores while reducing shine and mattifying all right let's chisel these damn cheeks now of course we have the iconic highlight and contour pro palette a lot of people said this is a good dupe last year for the anastacio powder contour kit as well so we have this to dive into if we want to we'll dip in here but also I just got this on ulta.com I was browsing for a new makeup and there is a new three steps to sculpt face sculpting palette not sure what the difference is this one says on here I mean you don't really say much this shade is not in here which I like but I think we're just gonna mix and match today people let's see what the hell's going on so we'll dip in here first and oh wow she's pigmented now I'm gonna take a little morphe brush and we're gonna dive into this one as well I did a little on my cheek bone area I like how soft and pretty it looks it's not too harsh did a little on the jaw line now I'm gonna take this and just do I'm scared let's try this shade we're just gonna do a little bit on the forehead area now to soften the contour we're gonna dip into this light shade right here we're just gonna go around and make sure it looks really blended and seamless all right we are contoured and now it's time to do a little blush before we highlight and I'm gonna go in with the sweet cheeks blush palette this looks really cute and I love how versatile all the colors are so I think for me I'm going to go in with this little peach color let me take this out of here I really want to do this top one because it has a little bit of shimmer in it as well but hmm kind of and with the blush I'm not gonna go too heavy I'm just gonna really focus it on the apples of my cheeks and just kind of blend it in to the front of the contour all right the cheeks are looking cute and flushed now this park was pretty cool it was very easy to build up and just make it really really nice so consistently the powder formulas are pretty good I love the contour powders they blended nice speaking of cheeks before we go away I also saw these brand new away.we glow illuminating powders that's me this looks like a shiny blush so I'm not sure what this is really supposed to do I'm just gonna take a little bit on this brush and just swirling around okay let's just put it right on top of here and see if anything happens oh girl not really and there really is no glow oh my god this has to be like the sheerest thing on earth okay definitely love the normal blush palette not a fan of this already it is too sheer for me girl mm-hmm so NYX recently put out this duo chromatic illuminating powder highlighter I have never tried this we're gonna have to give this a whirl today it looks like this in the pan hmm come on alien and also they put out something called strobe of genius it is a stick illuminating highlighter Wow okay I think we should go in right to our cheeks and let's see what happens let's just say how this goes on the skin oh holy okay so this is gonna be a good base I'm gonna take a dry Beauty Blender and just go into the edges right there now the trick is before it gets really dry let's take this with a brush now this shade is cold Twilight tint but almost a Twilight twink I'm a girl what is going on around here oh okay okay [Music] wowzers alright we are intergalactically highlighted this cheek is so intense I'm obsessed with it okay them two together that's a good combo alrighty now it's time to move on to brows I know the main event is definitely over sorry highlighting I love you I wanna highlight my old face again okay so for brows we do have some options I grabbed everything I could we have pencils we have this crazy three-in-one brow pencils we got the powder pencil and the three-in-one pencil and also we got some tented brow pomade so we don't create something out of those damn face I think I'm gonna use this crazy guy because look at this literally BAM like that is a blonde brow so what I like to do is sketch them out and then fill them in pomade so let's get to it [Music] alright so the outline is done and then I'll take this Taemin frame tinted brow pomade got this little angled brush right here we're just gonna go in to this damn pomade all right you guys the pomade isn't that bad I kind of prefer my dip brow from honest hacia a little better this one is very light and obviously a lot of brands do not make products for someone that has zero hair so I'm sure if you put this through hair it would be amazing now if it was bad just the consistency it was a little weird for me but hey this brow is on and the job is done now let me go do the other side and I'll be right back the brows are on girl okay now as I said earlier this was not my favorite brow product but definitely it worked took a little more finagling than normal but the brows are on so now it's time to move on to the eyes now of course y'all know how to grab an eye primer and we have the NYX proof it base basically it's an eyeshadow base and it supposed to be waterproof I'm like oh wow I guess we're just gonna put this on our lids and I have no idea what's about to happen here [Music] all right the base is on now I bought a bunch of these Avant pop eyeshadow palettes of course from NYX and then a few weeks ago more palettes came out and I'm my girl how the hell am I supposed to keep up these new multi finished shadow palettes just launched as well and I'm like okay this color like story here is giving me some life well let's give this palette a whirl so you all know what I like to do I'm gonna take a brush just going straight to this bone matte color and we're gonna coat our lids and under our brow we're just gonna prep out our brows even a little more of the shadow all right and I forgot to mention this is called the sugar high palette now I'm gonna go in with this peachy type of warm color I love this vibe I'm feeling right here and let's just see how she wants to blend [Music] all right the peach color is blended now the shadows did take a little bit more work blending out like I had to go back and back into the pan which is not like the worst thing ever they just kind of felt a little more on the cheap side so shadows for me for a drugstore it's either very hit-or-miss like they'll kill it with some things but not always everything is great which is okay because if this works for you it works for you I thought this is like a flop for me definitely not yet it just took a little bit more work so I think we are ready to move on one I'm dying to try this metallic shade right here but first I am going to darken in my crease area a little bit so let's just go in with this color and then we're just gonna really focus the brush right in here just to create the illusion of it even deeper crease [Music] all right I went in there with this dark color right here and then I'm also blending the peach color over it to just kind of go out and give it some more drama now I think it's time that I try this metallic shade I don't know whether it's gonna work dry or wet because I've never tested these formulas before so I'm gonna go in with a little synthetic brush right there and hmm it appears to have some pigment but does it look that metallic on the lid I guess we will find out right now huh it's literally all still on the brush what the actual fuck that doesn't go very well did it that is so disappointing okay I'm going to wet the brush with some setting spray and let's see if it changes let's go in with that one more time oh the bristles are damp we got a little bit more pigment thank you Jesus because I was a little worried is that my favorite in the world no definitely not I don't even know if I don't like it I'm like the setting spray helped a little bit it's still very flat and obviously the matte shades look gorgeous does the metallic kind of have a sloppy moment yeah kind of I'm gonna do one more time I almost want to dip into something even brighter like this crazy other one um let's just kind of mix and match yeah just go in the inner corner mm-hmm there we go the metallic is looking a little better now that it's wet definitely love the feeling here now we are going to go into I think this is like a metallic e color these ones are like foil to me this one is like kind of bronze II so I'm just gonna take this and gently sweep it below my lashline and let's see what happens but so far I'm actually liking how this look is turning out at first the shadows were a little rough but I think I'm liking them a little more now that I got to at least spend some more time with them so we're gonna take this and just sweep this right under the eye and just really blend it out pretty that is blended or really nicely now to really spice it up by I have this aligner I mean if we're just gonna go there let's fucking go there my highlight is so obnoxious already so this is a slide on glide on stone and definitely a turn-on waterproof extreme shine eyeliner Jesus Christ and then I love how it says after it this eyeliner is so good the name had to be this long okay well let's give it a whirl and let's see if it's true or not so here is this color and this one was called Azure I like it give us a weird type of look definitely need some mascara okay so mascara today I don't know what I'm gonna use we have these NYX one called stacked let's look at the wand here and let's see what stacked looks like woah it's like flat and has like piranha hairs on them let me hold my hand up real quick woah okay so we have that one and then we have this one which is the NYX XXL okay and what is oh my god girl how the hell is this gonna get on my eye this brush is enormous and y'all know I don't run from big things but let me try out the stacked one first and let's see what that one looks like if I don't like it we'll try the other one but that bristles those bristles were large [Music] [Music] okay definitely don't love this one kind of basic very basic mascara my lashes like uh-huh my lashes look tired alright let me try this big old brush oh okay we're gonna zoom in right here it is very clumpy like you see that like holy shit okay we're gonna put this away and then we're gonna take the bristles on the other one come back and help separate because this looks lumpy [Music] God okay so I don't like either of those mascaras I'm scared to do my bottom ones now definitely scared those were not for me the brush is just not what I'm looking for in a mascara let me try to do the bottoms with this I'm scared [Music] all right so mascara is on now I do want to say one thing that the waterproof eyeliner is not that waterproof my eyes literally never water up and if we zoom in right here I'm gonna pull my skin back it's already coming off right there which is a little bit of an annoyance to me okay the stacked mascara is a little better this brush was huge and a product was a little too crazy for me but um okay so I'm loving how the eyes are looking now I definitely think it's time for a lipstick oh my god now here's where it gets tricky there are so many lip products hell alright so I really don't know what to beg you guys I've been sitting here for a minute of course there are a lot of formulas this brand has of course the lingerie they have the liquid suede and now they have a brand new one which is the liquid suede metallic matte and I'm like okay we're in such a metallic era what about this one you guys hmm I don't know it's a little too red for this beautiful orange type of I of course this hot purple is not gonna fly and then the only other metallica have it like this dark dark like copper brown which i still don't think matches the eyes so I don't know I'm on the fence here let me swatch this one and just see how it looks because I don't even know what this formula is about oh wow that is a very metallic and very rose Pettus I feel like it's just not matching this look okay and then we have this what's slave I really can't pick I want to try a lingerie one I'm like feeling a nude lip I know you guys are like it was a really really light this one is called chickees let's try her out oh my god that literally looks like concealer this colors way she let you guys be right back alright even though I said I wasn't gonna do this color I'm just gonna try it and see what happens oh wow that just not match at all be right back alright so I have other nudes in here let me try this one called baby doll this one was so light I'm like let's pray this one looks a little better with this eye look okay I'm not mad at this one it's very easy [Music] okay this formula is weird y'all alright the nude lip is on not my favorite lip products I tried the liquid suede off-camera and I really liked it of course this is the metallic swatch on my hand damn girl that's pigmented or the lingerie not my favorite formula but it did blend out a little easier as it started to dry but look at this mess right here you guys what in the fuck okay now last but not least what else do we gotta do we gotta find some damn setting spray I had so many setting sprays we have the matte finish long-lasting and there's another long-lasting that says do we and I'm like hmm a lightweight water-based setting spray that keeps your makeup looking dewy and am AC ing through any kind of weather well let's give her a whirl there we go let's set this face smells like medical spray almost huh and how is my skin looking oh my god like I need to move buff in the setting spray that sprayed a lot thicker than I thought give me more all right let's zoom in and give our final thoughts alright guys so here is of course the final look and I'm gonna do a little run-through of my favorite products and the ones I did not love so I think what stood out the most for me was obviously the highlighter you guys see it it is blinding it's beautiful I love the stick mixed with the powder I think it looks behind in the sides that I thought the primer did really well I love mixing them both the gold one was definitely mm-hmm and the foundation overall now that it's been about an hour so I'm looking here and I'm not mad at it oh I think it looks really pretty a little you know not as full full coverage as I love it setting powder was alright a little chalky but the overall powder I put in my entire face looked great I'm looking the monitor like those eyes are not bad the eyeshadow palette was good I actually really liked it the ultimate multi finish it did me well and the eyeliner does look good it did come off a little bit in here so I went in and did again that second layer did beautiful now things that I did not like so well the shimmer shadows on here were a little rough until they were wet you know that I know I'm like I love the palette but I also kind of didn't love it at the same time I kind of want to use some of their other palettes in future videos to give them a whirl so that would definitely have to do a look after that now the eyeshadow primer it did pretty good I think it made it look great wait we're talking about things I don't like you guys look at me I'm like trying to find the good in everything right now things I did not love the damn mascara what in the hell these brushes are not good I'm definitely gonna have to try out different ones because these two kind of flopped for me and besides that just setting spray is that anything too bad I don't really look dewy though so I'm like girl dewy what I'm like I need more like bitch I don't feel Joey right you guys besides that thank you so much for waiting so patiently for this video or not so patiently I know a lot of you who have been anticipating my thoughts so overall I feel like all the products I use as a whole were good and consistent of course we had a few flops but hey if there is an entire makeup line that is going to happen so remember you guys do not forget to enter my giveaway if you skip through this video watch the intro and you'll find out the details all right but besides that I will see you guys on the next video thank you as always for watching muah love you guys 
Oh Lord jesus take the wheel alright y'all hi what's up everybody welcome back to my channel so you probably are asking yourselves what the hell are we doing here today so a youtuber named Thomas Halbert recently created a new we'll call it a challenge type of video where he follows a tutorial from another Beauty influencer or youtuber and he literally followed the entire tutorial from start to finish and recreated the look and followed all the steps now you may be asking yourselves wait a minute I think I heard you mention this before yes this is the video in question and yes he followed one of my tutorials now me and Thomas have not always been cool with each other but hey baby it's a new year we DM each other and we are all good so if anyone wants to start any drama there's not any sorry to break the news to you but I thought that his video idea was a really fucking funny and I'm like ok cool we got to do this and I just thought the gabbie show did one and I'm like ok baby I'm hopping on so I asked you guys yesterday on snapchat who should I follow like what influencer and I did a poll on Twitter which girl a lot of you guys voted so we ended it like a few hours ago right here so the people have spoken the votes are in and you guys picked 10 emoji for me to follow so baby I am here right now we are going to put one of her tutorials up here on the screen and we're just gonna follow along so let me type in YouTube here so one of the most popular ones looks like the how to cake your face like a pro the trilogy bitch has over 5 million views on this oh ok this makeup look looks cute alright now me and Tana have actually never met yet which girl when are we filming come over but we have DM each other we know each other we're cool with each other so I was really happy that you guys picked Anne and I James Charles would have been amazing as well and if you guys liked this one maybe I'll do another one but me and Tana we've never hung out yeah and I'm like bitch I look for your personality she's uh kind of always stoned like me so I'm down so before this video I got very lit we're about to dive in and see if Jeffrey star can KQ space lega pro seductive there's an STD ad for Durex condoms BC right before this video that about sums up Tana Moshe alright now that we've gotten through that ad hey we got to pay our rent baby now we are going to there's hair in my eye from this jacket I'm going blind oh this makeup look is cute really good turning myself into a reasonable unfuckable 5 to looking like a naked fucking moron that no one would put their genitals near even if you paid them um I can relate to that mole-rat check I've been called that a lot recently on the internet because I have no eyebrows so clearly we don't real we all see about that baby seeing you guys try out this makeup look or trial products but I love and this video was a lot of fun to make and I really hope you alright let's jump into the tutorial would you wash your hands when you could just like not okay so she wants to wash her hands before applying the makeup and she uses an incisor instead girl I am NOT even gonna wash my hands like I'm good my hands are clean and I'm ready to roll well that was a crazy noise and also you guys I tried to mimic her backdrop but none of the walls in my house had skid marks on them and my iPhone chords don't hang from my wall but I tried first base primer spray okay so we're gonna prime the skin I actually don't have that but it has the word base in it so I'm gonna go in with my favorite Bobbi Brown a vitamin enriched face base and this is my tried-and-true so I see her spring in which I love but we are just gonna use a damp Beauty sponge so we're just gonna coat our entire face and try to get some moisture and this dry skin it's really cool so I keep using it it might just see like water have you guys seen those bottles of Evian things on Sephora and it's literally just water spray that's like $10 like it's literally like the only ingredient is water and it's like refreshing face like like it's water but you can literally put water in like a spray bottle and then they sell for like $10 I don't know who is dumb enough to use that shit then you're gonna use a benefit Porefessional I really like this stuff cuz that really big pores because I constantly pop blackheads watch sick bitch would it be clean just look at that okay well um I pick my skin too honestly so I have that primer actually have the new one this is the pearl pore fessional version that just has a little bit of a sheen to it so let's okay you guys there's so much hair in my mouth which normally it's from like a ball sack so I'm just gonna take this jacket off because bitch alright so now we are going to take the primer Oh mine's not even oh it's not even open yet way too much of this on your hand like way too fucking much of this and you're gonna put it everywhere because there's not one part of my skin that doesn't have like giant pores my skin has gotten so much clearer since the first time I film these videos I must say and that's because I have a good skincare routine that I do like once a week because this literally is like primer that you can ever buy ever I'd like every other primer is so shitty compared to this primer so highly Carl this is actually an amazing primer so I'm down for this no let me get this all over my face and neck PDQ three foundations that I was obsessed with and I went on and on and on telling you guys how I would never ever ever use another and then I found this foundation sort of though do I have not one not oh she likes him Boca bridge loved it so much this is the know this video was like a year ago so that foundation is so full coverage my bottles from that we're actually leaking in my drawer so I sadly threw those away don't have them but I will use something that is very full coverage as well okay let's see how she applies it yes girl that's gonna cover your attitude it's gonna cover up your past just gonna cover up blasts STD you had baby I feel you I'll do you one that I used to use it's super thin consistency like a moisturizer but then it covers everything and it stays on for like 24 hours it's not drying like it does 24 hours can I swear to god you better be washing and that makeup off every night which what I have a sick feeling you don't okay so we're gonna use a lot of foundation that's what she loves and want so we are going to go in with the very full coverage hourglass all ours a foundation one of my favorites over the last few months it covers a lot to makes you look very plastic and fake which I live for so let's do it I'm suing Tana this foundation just squirted and got on one of my Perkins see that right there girl oh my god all right so uh oh end barely got on my hand I think it was stuck why it's so what's good let's try that again that was scary alright so I am going to take what shade what shades of my BR forty and BD twenty and we're just gonna do a little mixing and matching and she's putting it all over her face so let's see how she blends it out you just said never do your eyebrows I love that I kind of want to see her junior eyebrows off but no I don't I'm looking like why the fuck do people oh just fucked up her shirt it doesn't give a fuck and that's a boy I think I've lived for this bitch because you're a fake spigen bitch there's also a giant gash in my beauty blender because lumen tried to eat this one okay that gash in the beauty blender there could be bacteria hidden in there baby you need to throw that away and get yourself a new one oh girl into my skin you want to make sure that your beauty blender is damped and this looks so much better than any other brush cuz brushes cement a profound Shirley Street heat okay the fact that she's taking the Beauty Blender and just smearing it down instead of buffing it is giving me so much life okay Tana we're gonna take the Beauty Blender and we're gonna balance our foundation into her skin and we're gonna look flawless because the bat that streaky method girl uh-uh so I'm trying to rub it down like she did girl it's looking streaky I don't know about this technique girl I'm just gonna go right over grandma right there I don't know pulling down is good it might make you age a little quicker okay I mean I love that she does not want her makeup streaky but blinding it again I'm like I don't know if that's necessary this is a stuff for a brush and let's blend with her streaks or like anything like that I like it to look super look seamless what does foundation I don't need an under-eye concealer because it covers so well like it makes me yeah same thing god I thought she was about to say we're gonna skip concealer and I was gonna be like okay so let's see what her favorite concealer is well I definitely have the age rewind I literally did a full face maybelline video and I've used this a few times the reason why I don't use it a lot is because they don't have a shade light enough for me so we will use this and maybe a little bit of something else okay so we're gonna do a highlighted effect hi can this concealer come out hello oh there's some I remember I really liked the formula of this but I don't think I was living for the shade she wants to put everywhere where you're gonna highlight the face and she puts on acne I don't have any pimples today which is shocking so we're just gonna draw this on just like this all right so she is about to do setting powder so let me blend out this concealer and see how we're looking oh right we are buffed out this actually looks really creamy I kind of forgot that I liked his concealer so I think maybe but she is about to set her face with Laura Mercier I can already see it by her hands BAM of course I have that so let's see how she likes to apply it [Music] it was it definitely was she literally okay okay okay she literally took a huge powder brush just literally dips in and like oh my god that's a lot of product and she literally just went she went and y'all I tried to play me the contour actually used to use that palette it was one of the best formulas okay we're fast forwarding your contour but let me finish that my face it's me George Washington okay so we are going to do the three that she meant Anna said using the lemare bronzer I love this one and we're just going to go really hard in there what she is saying is we're just gonna take our brush and go with like the number three like that of course you want to buff and blend it into the skin I put in a lot so I'm about to diffuse it a little bit but girl that is what she is talking about so a lot of people do like the forehead the cheek all the way to the jaw of course but I'm just gonna take this brush and push it up and into the skin and if it looks muddy like that just to fuse it with a Beauty Blender or a brush but let's see how else does she uses this girl white and then I do my brows then I do like banana powder okay so she puts the banana powder on top of the concealer oh my god okay I am like too fair for banana powder but we will see here what happens so banana powder is way too yellow for my pale ass so we're going to skip that step and let's see what is next bitch when I was in high school there was no naked palettes ever but there was herb indications just gonna fill in her brows since she doesn't really pluck or give a fuck about her brows I'm just gonna leave mine how they are and let's go right - okay so I reviewed that palette like right around that time this came out like a year ago I don't know where it is but today we are going to pull out be brand new on a saucy Beverly Hills soft glam eyeshadow palette it looks like this and I think there is colors comparable to what she is about to do so let's see how she is gonna do her eyes today hopefully it looks good but I don't think I'm comfortably good enough at eyeshadow yet or I can explain to you guys like how to do it and like be confident in it like I feel like I'm gonna get a lot of heat like oh my god that shadow sucks about the fact that she thought this was like a tutorial like when I got Mitch so this is how so fucking real I don't give a fuck whatever you whatever your opinion on her is it's just so fucking real like myself I'm fucking living the orange in the middle oh she's just pulling that skin bag let's just grab a shadow brush and we will dip into so let's see let's do burnt orange and orange soda and she literally just fucking pop that right into her crease so let's see what happens [Music] now honestly I feel like a super beginner and I chat up and you want to just ease into it uh-huh totally just put a transition color like this in the crease blend it out really well and then just put like a white or like a shimmery color all over your lid and then put on like lashes and eyeliner and I still think that that looks really really pretty I'm like that purple how beauty girls I mean that's actually some real advice this white color and put this all in the inner corner oh okay so usually I would do a light base all over the lid and then go in with these shades cuz it would already make it I think blend extra crazy but hey if that's how she does a bitch that's how she does it so let me finish off of this transition shade and let's pop in that white alright so we are going to just go into the top shade up here the tempura and I think she's using a brush kind of like this and let's see how she applies it oh oh okay okay okay okay she's already going to the middle so we're just gonna take that shade and we're gonna put it all in there just like she did and she did it right there almost like a little halo moment cute alright now she's ready for the middle she just took like a shimmery basic ass shade and just plopped it right in the middle I couldn't even really see it Tanna what happened there okay so I'm just gonna put the shade bronze up here and she used the same brush so I'm gonna use the same brush and we're just gonna dip right in there and we'll just pack some right in the middle just a little BAM right in there okay so we'll take the shade rustic right here and then she's using the same brush so one two three BAM that's easy-peasy and she was doing it on the outer edges right about there I mean I'm not even mad about this look right now let me see how far she takes it down she took that color that's like on top of her I didn't see like what under her yes she's a innovative queen oh she's doing it on herself that is some Realty right there all right let me finish blending and this bitch is ready to go on liners slow it down yeah I must say before you guys do not share eyeliner with your sister mother or friends you never know what someone's I've been doing at home with their eyeballs okay I am using the Tom Ford eye defining pen [Music] we've all been there oh she's already on lashes fuck she's quick okay so we're just gonna do our liner real quickly and let's see how she's gonna look i aligner is done now it looks like she is ready for lashes so let's see what kind I'm fuckin deceased right now dry fucking clear it dries like clear mixing their foundation and then it looks like someone came in your eye if fuckin sucks and it burns okay so I don't even have a black duo I literally only have the clear so I'm gonna have calm eyes today which nothing new but okay let me trim down these lashes and let's apply them all right we're gonna coat the lash band lash band and I see Tanna right now so let's see what she's doing okay we're blowing on the lash and she just popped that right on and work yes you know maybe the fact that she didn't do mascara first I'm shocked all right we're popping this on and then we'll figure it out all right this feels so weird with having no mascara on this is very weird all right what is the next girl I'm scared just to blend your real eyelashes with your fake eyelashes I think that it looks a million time or before girl know that formula is so wet and clumpy it literally looks like you've got face fucked and your mascara is like do not recommend that we're gonna stick to our iconic benefit roller lash but let's see what she does Oh what about dick Oh what did she say about dick girl that's my specialty what do you got to say about some penis baby Oh same here baby but sucking since I was 12 oh okay you weren't so horny are you a Scorpio what's tinier you Tana I need to know okay so she literally just did off camera so let me I guess do this mascara and the other lash and I'll be right back all right lashes are on let's see what's next why what's oh she has a MAC lipstick oh my god I want to go to her house and clean her entire I can make a place Oh immaculate okay what is this one all right Nikki's dude we're just gonna put that on it's kind of a similar shade to what she's wearing and kind of all right let's see what all she says this is the only lipstick that I really wear it's only one that I think looks that good on me NYX matte finish setting spray and it's awesome I used to use like expensive ones like the makeup for everyone this is literally like six bucks all right so she does a setting spray thank God because I'm depressed you guys know highlight Tana what the fuck happened all right let me finish this blip stick and then go cry in the corner all right so I'm gonna go in with the Urban Decay all nighter setting spray and let's see how she applies hers all right so I'm gonna go in with the Urban Decay all nighter setting spray she did hers off-camera so let me just spray my face all right we are set bitch all right now what is next this is how to get fucked if you're like a 6 or 7 like me I also really

What’s up everybody?
Welcome back to my channel. Alright you guys, so today we’re going
to try out a crazy new foundation that just launched from Chanel Beauty. Now listen, you guys just saw a Chanel
lip-gloss in my March favorites video. I am obsessed with it. Tell me why I can’t stop wearing it,
even though I’m not wearing it right now. I was at the mall the other day
and the lady at SAX she goes, “Jeffree, there’s a new Chanel foundation,
have you tried it yet?” And I’m like, “No girl, I have not,
but I’m about to.” Before we even talk about that, I know you guys
are all gonna slap me if I don’t tell you about this. Today I am wearing Pink Pearl Gloss
which is from Bite Beauty, Love Bite. They are cruelty-free, they are vegan,
it fucking smells amazing, it's like candy. And they’re a brand from Canada,
if you guys don’t know who Bite is. They are also in Sephora, I love them. Now back to the foundation.
This foundation you guys is $135, I know most of you are like “girl bye!” Now this is called the Chanel
Sublimage LE Teint Foundation. Now it comes in this gold unit carton,
first we’re gonna do a little unboxing as well. This feels really heavy, I just wanna put that out there.
Chanel always feels very luxurious. If you have been watching my channel for a while,
you know I’m obsessed with their Lose Powder. Recently I’ve been using LaMer a lot,
but this is like… Hi, it’s almost empty. It’s amazing and I’ve also been using
their powder foundation a lot, which we’re gonna use later on in
the video after we apply everything. It’s this little guy right here and the mirror
is so dirty. I store this in my purse. So we’ll use that in a minute. Alright, so now onto the foundation you guys. This is crazy, I think $135 is fucking insane! But it’s Chanel,
so you guys know what do I say in every video? You know you’re paying for the name on top of the formula
and whatever else is going on here, so If you wanna see me test out this crazy
Chanel foundation, then keep on watching. Now I love their packaging,
it’s always looking expensive. So when you open it,
you see that right there? That is a spatula you take out
the foundation, which already tells me it’s gonna be in like
a glass or plastic component. So, this little spatula you basically
just scoop it out and it kind of allegedly is for of course sanitary reasons,
so you not dipping your fingers in there or your brush. It has a cute little Chanel symbol at the top,
which you guys know I’m obsessed with already. Now when you open it… Oh, smaller
than I thought. So there you have it. It actually comes with another product
with it, this is a brush, okay? I was gonna apply it with an Artis brush today,
but since it already has its own brush I think it’s only fair to do at least half the face
with this, we can see how this works with it. Now the bottle of course is a little smaller
than I thought. For $135 I’m like “girl”. But let’s open it up and see what happens.
So it has of course a little protector. Bam! This is what it looks like. Now tell me,
that’s a lot of product not gonna lie. I think from the price point I think
there should be a little bit more. But I guess we’ll have to see what
kind of coverage it’s giving us. Now you guys know I love to give you all the facts,
so this has 30 grams of product which is 1 ounce. Pretty standard for skincare and foundation
honestly. I mean, this has 1 ounce, I guess maybe cause it’s packaged differently
it looks a bit smaller, but same amount of product. Alright, so now I am on Chanel.com. Ad you guys
know I have to always spill the tea before I try it, cause I don’t wanna you know judge it
unless I know all the facts. Alright, so this is an exquisite
lightweight foundation, it’s creamy texture offers buildable light to medium
coverage for a glowy, healthy and luminous look. So this says that the formula enhances
the intense power of vanilla planifolia, okay. That’s the signature ingredient.
Along with the luminosity diamond powder and the comfort of plant based ingredients
to leave the complexion radiant, revitalized and optimally vitalized, okay? For some reason this is saying
that for the first time ever Chanel Foundation Formula is
enriched with “diamond powder”. Alright, so let’s dive into the review
and the application. Now of course we’re gonna prime
the skin like I always do and this is one of my favorites, I’m obsessed with it.
This is the Farsali Unicorn Essence. It’s just a really good primer for just minimizing
pores and keeping your skin really snatched. I’m crying baby. And I’m just gonna rub this all
out with my… rub this out, that sounds awful. I’m gonna rub this out with my hands.
I guess that’s all rubbed out. Alright, we are going to dip. I don’t know how
much to use, so let’s just start normal. I would never put that much on my forehead,
there we go. I’m just gonna kind of smooth this out. Now I do wanna say one thing, you guys know
I always talk about smell, texture, everything. This feels like literally like expensive
skincare with color to it. Alright I’m just gonna grab a mirror and let’s blend
this product right here. Let’s see what happens. This is really light, but like it’s
covering my discoloration areas. The brush is not bad, it already like shedded,
a piece of hair came off on my forehead girl. Okay, this isn’t the worst thing. I think it’s like a little
bit of an annoyance to me that it’s so short. Like I need a long brush
to like really go in I feel like. But this is still on the side. But you guys
can already see the difference, it does have luminosity like it said. It’s very light
which I’m not mad at for like an everyday moment. But I’m a full coverage bitch,
so I’m like ahhhh. Let’s let this dry for a second and I’m just
gonna give you guys first impressions already, just like right away from just trying it. Now, I did forget to mention what shade
I of course bought, sorry about that. Now I got three shades and I tried shade matching
after I did the primer, just like right here. I swear to God this one
is a really good match. This is shade 20 beige, for everyone
that has a similar skin tone to me. I tried some lighter ones and I’m
a pale ass bitch but the lighter ones were actually like ghastly like really pale.
And I was like oh my god hell no! Alright, now the only thing I’m having
a problem with is this shade range online,  there’s literally only ten shades. I’m like, girl,
and they’re all like pretty kind of light. Now I am 20 beige, it goes up
to a 60 beige but the color looks not as tan or dark as I would
of expected from Chanel. But maybe they’re darker in person, I don’t know.
Of course I did not buy them all. But let’s zoom in with my mirror
and let’s see what this looks like. Now, remember I only applied one layer,
I do wanna do a second one maybe to see if we can get it medium,
medium coverage. But looking like close-up I will say this,
it’s really pretty. Like I was shocked because you know,
a lot of the time with these expensive ass products they haven’t been working out lately
on my channel. But this one is really nice. Now, I will say this, of course I haven’t
done concealer or set the skin or the face and I haven’t done any powder. It feels a little… I don’t want to say tacky
with the primer but it just feels a little… mmm sticky is the wrong word
but it just feels a little… it just feels like somethings
on my face I guess. It’s definitely light, it is light coverage but
for some reason this could be an easy like hey I have 5 minutes to get ready, I’m just going
to the movies or I’m going to the grocery store, or I don’t know you’re about to go on your knees
and you don’t want to look fucking rough, girl we’ve all been there. Let me a bit of another layer to see how it would
look with a more medium type of moment. Alright, so we’re just gonna dab
a little bit more around the face. Come on forehead, my forehead is like bitch
move along. My nose has enough coverage. Okay, so we’re gonna go back in with
the brush and let’s see what this looks like. Okay cool, so now that we have the second
layer on let’s take a peek here. It’s crazy because it doesn’t really
look thick or cakey thank God. Cause a lot of the times if you
kind of let the first layer dry and you go in again it’s a little weird,
it’s a little funky I know we’ve all been there. So, putting the second layer on top of the first
one didn’t change the formula, it still looks really pretty. I’m pleasantly
surprised at the coverage actually. It is definitely a light medium, I’m not
gonna say this is a full medium. But that’s really pretty, I’m looking
in the mirror and I really like it. Like I’m not seeing any discoloration, of course I’m personally going with
concealer in a minute just to brighten. So I definitely want to do that
and see how it looks after. Oh my god! One thing I don’t love is
when I put that lid back on… girl messy. Alright, now I just put on some
Urban Decay concealer. We’re gonna use an Artis brush to buff this out and let’s see how it looks
on top of the Chanel foundation yes. Now this is an extreme highlighted look,
if you don’t want this look don’t do it. Alright concealer, holy shit! You see
the difference right here you guys? This is where I put my contour.
I know it looks a little extreme on camera. Alright now we’re gonna take this Laura Mercia Contour
Book, this is a crème contour palette, I love it. We’re just gonna take a little synthetic and we’re gonna go here to contour shade 1
and we’re just gonna go like that hehe. Alright now I’m gonna take a little bit of this and
go down the nose for some extreme contouring. Okay now this may look a little dark but once it’s blended,
it blends nicely with the skin. So no one freak out here. Alright now you can use
a Beautyblender, you can use an Artis brush again. I’m just gonna kind of wipe off if there’s
any concealer there really quick. And then I’m just gonna use the same
brush and buff and blend. Alright now I’m just gonna finish up with the face
real quickly with some setting powder. And I’m just gonna use a Chanel,
it’s gonna be a Chanel day. So, we’re gonna finish off the face with
the Chanel Undereye Setting Powder. And then we’re gonna cover
the entire face with the Double Perfection Lumineer Powder
and I’ll be right back. Alright you guys, we’re finishing
off the face right now. It’s looking pretty snash,
like very dull-like, very stunning. Now I’m being so extra I’m using
this Chanel powder brush. I kind of took the brush and
softened the contour. But I definitely think we’re
missing some highlight. So let’s just plump myself and use me and Manny's
new shade Eclipse, I think that’s kind of fitting. I’m just gonna pop that on the cheekbones
like it ain’t shit girl, don’t play me. Alright so now the concealer is on, the face is set.
I’ve got foundation powder, we have highlight. I’m looking like it is really,
really nice you guys. Like I really don’t have many complaints
and you know this bitch likes to complain and let you guys have it. But like it looks really,
really, really nice, that’s what I have to say. I have a dog hair on my mouth, excuse me. So I think it’s only fair if I go to the office,
run some errands, I have some shit to do today. I have some meetings, I’m gonna
go see Manny and Laura. And then I might come back in probably like six
hours and let’s just see how it all settles. So I will be back later today. Woo, alright everybody it’s been
a long day. It is what time is it? Okay It’s now 9 at night and I am leaving for
Las Vegas tomorrow morning and I’m exhausted. So by the time you watch
this I will be in Sin City on a business trip with Nikita
and let’s get back to the review. I have some notes Y’all, I have some notes.
So it’s been about 6 hours and 45 minutes to be exact. And I will say this, the foundation
overall held up amazing. But, one little flaw I did notice
is let me push this hair back. It did cake up a little bit under my eyes,
but remember I did do heavy concealer. And then we did the Chanel
lose powder under it, so maybe the concealer was a little
bit too heavy for the foundation. Remember the foundation was
very lightweight, very luminous. It had light to medium coverage.
Throughout the day it really lasted nicely. I really don’t have any complaints
except my under eyes look a little, uh I guess rough, they look
a little cakey to me personally. Maybe on camera you guys
aren't really seeing it.  But just right under there I’m having
a little bit of an issue. So normally I would take a Beautyblender
or sponge and just kind of touch it up. I didn’t touch up throughout the day like I normally would,
I wanted you guys to see it raw. But overall I really,
really like this foundation. I’m shocked because you know
I’m really a full coverage type of ho. But overall I think this
is an amazing foundation. But for $135… that’s where it gets tricky for me when
I start to do more and more of these reviews. Because to me, like Wet and Wild Photofocus
for 5.99 could do the exact same thing. But mmm… no buts, I was going to say
maybe there’s like skincare in this, but no we read all the ingredients
so it’s nothing spectacular. It’s not like an extremely anti-aging ingredient
in here that’s gonna change your mind. So here’s where it gets tricky. It’s Jeffree Star approved based on a working,
the formula work, it looks amazing. But I also wanna throw it out there
that just because I approve it… like yes it did exactly what it said,
it looks amazing. It’s been hours, I love it. it looks really pretty like
I didn’t really need makeup on. I threw on some sunglasses, I have a little
sunglass mark right here, excuse me. The price point… it’s too ridiculous honestly. I don’t love it enough where I’m probably
gonna use the entire thing down to the jar where it’s empty and rebuy it. Like you know me, I’m always
gonna be honest with you. I think it’s beautiful, I’m definitely
gonna try it out a few times. I think just for an everyday moment, it’s cute
if you wanna splurge on something. I think it blended out flawlessly,
but there’s a million dupes out there and it didn’t like blow my mind
where I’m like oh my god! This foundation… like no one else can make it,
like no one else could dupe this.  It can be duped. So you guys heard it here,
that’s exactly how I feel. I think I’m gonna be using it in
a few more videos just for fun and everyday use because I did love
how it really gave this nice look. I think I would love to wear it
without the heavy concealer. Maybe something light
and not so much powder. But I love the kind of like light foundation
with a highlight moment and some gloss. Not that that’s gonna be
how I look all the time. Don’t get it twisted cause I need
the full drag eye every other day. But alright guys I think
that is it for this review. This Chanel Sublimage LE Teint Foundation
is Jeffree Star approved. Alright you guys, until the next
time you see me, I miss you, I love you, mwah, and I’ll see you
on the next one. Bye, guys! 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to my channel. Now in today's video we are
going to do something that I've never really done
on my channel before and no I don't mean
a group gang bang. We're going to do a full
face first impressions, so basically I have a lot of products
laid out on my table and I'm going to be using things
that I've never tried before, so instead of doing all these individual videos
and all these things, and reviewing them, we're gonna review them live
on camera and god forbid, let's see what the hell happens. Now, everything that I'm going to be using today is brand new, except one thing I've tried it literally once. Well someone else did it on me. So I've technically never did it on myself. Now this is going to be a little interesting,
 if something doesn't go right, just pray for me. If you guys want to see me
try some new stuff and play with makeup,
then keep on watching. Before we get started, I actually put on a serum
before I did my makeup which I should have done on camera,
so you can slap me later. I discovered this crazy new thing
from the brand La Prairie, if you've never heard of them before, they are a very expensive skincare
and makeup brand, they mainly specialize in anti-ageing skin, moisturizers, serums, creams,
eyes, everything. They're such a good brand. But basically, this is the white caviar
illuminating pearl infusion. This is going to protect your
skin from pollutions and sun and all of the crazy
dangers of the world. It's also allegedly supposed
to take out sun spots and any discoloration so of course I'm going to use
this for probably a few months and see what happens. But, I did already lay it down. So today we're going to be trying
a brand new primer from one of my favorite
brands Armani Beauty. Now, this is the day long skin perfecter. So basically this is going to create
a nice blur effect on the skin, allegedly, that's what the packaging said and it is supposed to keep my skin
snatched all day long. Let's give it a whirl. I'm just going to take a little
 bit on my fingers. Oo. I don't want to put too much on. Oh it's like really ... Mm, it smells a little almost like
hairspray and perfume. Which is a little weird to me. Not horrible, it wasn't like overpowering but it was a little weird. Of course, I am going to do my neck, can never forget about that. It feels almost like the Sisley primer
that I reviewed months ago as well, it feels like really tacky which I love because that means the makeup
should be laid down amazing. But we will see shortly. Alright, bam. Now for foundation today,
speaking of Sisley, they have a brand-new foundation out. It might be a few months old,
I'm not sure, but I bought it like a month ago
and it's been sitting here. This is the all day long flawless
skincare foundation. So I love their stuff,
but it all has like really expensive skincare in the makeup, it's supposed to just really
be nice over time. We will see if that happens. Now this shade is 0+Vanilla. I tried to shade match myself
at the mall when I bought this, so let's see if I did it correctly. This is a very long lasting
and smoothing effect blended with the lightness and natural
finish of a second skin foundation. It's supposed to be soft and comfortable, oil free, it ensures a beautiful, hydrated, soft and comfortable skin-like look. Alright, now the bottle looks like this. I like it, it's very slim. Kind of reminds me of the DiorSkin
star foundation, like the bottle. Now normally you guys know
I love doing a beauty blender with my foundation so I'm going
to try it and if it starts to look weird, I'll use a brush but let’s give it a whirl. Oh this smells really fresh like nice skincare for sure. Let's just do a little, I'm just going to dot it around my face. I'm just going to start here and
then we'll work out way up so, did I put too much on?
We're about to find out. Okay, just a few bounces of this,
maybe because it's wet and maybe the foundation isn't supposed
to be with water, it's looking a little weird like watch, I'm just going to buff this part out. It's almost like, blotchy so I'm going to go in with the Oval 8
brush from Artis and I'm just going to brush this
all over my face before it dries, god forbid it dries and looks crazy. So far it blended it's like a little darker,
it's blending nice. I think the beauty blender
was like not having it. Maybe it's the formula, so I'm just going to take a little bit
more on this Artis brush. We'll go in with the neck. Alright the foundation is blended. I like it, I'm not loving it so far. A lot of the times, you guys,
primers and foundations, sometimes they do not mix. Now this one looks alright,
it's not like cakey or crazy, the foundation is I think beautiful but it's a little patchy from where
the beauty blender was. I've tried to smooth it out
but using it on this side and everywhere else with the brush, definitely was a lot nicer, I think the formula probably
doesn't like water or just, okay. Now for concealer,
what do we have today, where is she at? This is the new soft matte complete
concealer from the brand Nars. Now, I love Nars, I've been a huge fan of them for
about ten years. This is their brand new concealer, let's open it up. I think this is like a full coverage
one, I'm in shade light one chantille. I'm scared to apply this with a beauty blender
because what if it makes the foundation weird, but I guess that's the whole point
of this video is to try things out. So I'm just going to use my finger and see what happens.
Oh, okay. It's like, it's a thick formula which I like. I'm just going to try it out first with this,
before I do full on. Oh she's thick, which I like. Oh that was a nice little highlight.
Okay, okay. I see what's going on here, so let me dip in again and I'm just
going to press that under my eye. So I'm just going to kind of buff that in with my finger.
Now before I do this side, I am going to take the brush and just kind of test the waters. I'm scared, I'm scared.
Oh wow this blends so easy with this brush. That is really really nice. Like right away,
I'm judgmental with concealers. A lot of the time you can tell really quickly if it's going
to settle or get weird and this one is like butter. Now to set this concealer, I didn't have
any new setting powders around the house so I bought one from the same brand that
made that crazy serum I first showed you guys. La Prairie has something called the cellular treatment
loose powder, I know it's a fucking long word. This is supposed to be fucking amazing so let's open her up.
Comes with a spatula embedded into the back. Woah. That's crazy. Then it comes
with a little fluffy pad type thing. Whoo, never used this before so I'm like holy shit.
Oh, oh my god. Okay, so then this comes up. Oh my god and then it's sealed. There's another
barrier oh my god, so it says to pull this. There's the powder, holy shit. Now I always apply
setting powder with a damp beauty blender so we're just going to try this out. I'm going to use
this plastic actually and pour some in here. Press in there, oh that's a lot of fucking powder. Oh, lord.
Oh wow, it definitely has a little bit of color to it. I'm just going to put a lot on and we'll brush it off
in a second. If you guys hear any weird noises, my jacket it just sounds weird. I'm sorry about that.
Alright, so I've let that soak in for a minute, now I'm just going to take a blank Nars brush,
little kabuki and just kind of dust it off. Okay wow. That powder was kind of everything.
The concealer has like settled, unreal. It's not cakey, it's not clumpy, it's not weird. Huh, okay,
I'm waiting for a disaster to happen but it hasn't hit me yet. Next up, let's do some contour
before we set our entire mug. I have a few new products from Benefit that I have
been dying to use. I just recently did a trip with them where we went to an island and we got to play with
some of their new products. I was like oh my god, bitch, I cannot wait to film with this. So this is the Hula
quickly contour stick. This is a cream contour, now one of my makeup artists lipstick Nick used
this on me the other day for a photo shoot and I was like oh okay this formula though. So she used this on me wherever I would contour then
she set it with powder which of course is recommended. I was like really really impressed,
so of course you can go in with the stick and go in on your own face if you want.
I mean, hi honey, are those cheekbones or what? This is more of a sheer formula so don't be like
oh my god, Jeffree you just put on way too much, it definitely sheers out and it looks
beautiful. Let me just blend this out, now beauty blender of course can happen. Maybe a brush,
let me just show you how this sheers down you guys. Everyone at home is probably like, bitch you've lost
your damn mind. No this does sheer out, I promise, don't think I'm coo-koo. Yes, now I know
at first you were probably like oh my god bitch, you put on way too much product because I always
rip people to filth for doing that but see the difference? It sheers out really really pretty and just kind of
gives you that definitive what's up bitch, what it is, you got a problem? Now, another
trick that I love that lipstick Nick did on me is she took a synthetic brush and went back and
forth on the product and instead of drawing it on, she just took it like this and more so just kind of
painted it on which for my forehead and nose I love because sometimes I do go overboard,
but this is really easy to apply, so I'm just going to go all the way down
my nose and just kind of cut her in half. And then same thing for the forehead,
we're just going to cut my forehead in half and of course it's going to look a little intense at first
then we're going to sheer her out so do not worry. Alright, the nose is looking a little slender,
the forehead is a little dark but you know what? We're doing a severe highlight
and contour look today. Now normally I would take a powder
and coat my entire face with ti, but I don't have any new finishing
foundation powders. You guys know I always go to my Mac cosmetics
studio fix powder, sorry girl not today. So I was looking in all my new
packages that I bought recently, new makeup and YSL put out something that
is called the matte finish and blur, it's in French and you all know I'm not even
going to dare try. So basically this is blurring and finishing
the face without additional coverage. Now when I opened it right now I was like, oh my god,
it's like pure white, by the way the YSL symbol in there, I live for, I die for. So I'm just going to take
a brush and let's just see what happens. I'm just going to put this around the contour
incase it really does fuck this shit up. I'm scared. Okay now I've done my eyes, around my mouth,
underneath the contour, let me just grab this powder brush and dust off. Tell me why,
I don't know if you can tell in the camera or not but that shit made my skin like, woah. Okay, finished
my face. I am excited to try this out more. The face is set now I am going to go in with
this Morphe 527 brush for a little contour and I'm going to pull out the new Benefit cosmetics
cheek parade palette. Look how cute this is though. This comes with blushes, it comes with bronzers,
this has the infamous Hula of course and then there's a new shade Hula light. I'm going to
mix Hula light and Hula bronzer just for an added little, now they are already carved out but of course you want
to set that cream and just kind of gently go over them. Alright, the face is fucking bronzed girl, the jaw is cut,
the forehead is on fleek today. Next step before I do anything, I'm going
to do a little blush, a little highlight, yes. Now for blush today I am going to be using
the Kylie cosmetics pressed blush powder, it looks something like this,
kind of like the highlighters, not kind of really the packaging is identical of course.
This shade is called barely legal. So let's just put this on the apples of our cheeks.
I like this so far because it's buildable. I've of course dipped in twice now and it looks really natural.
I don't like blushes where they're so pigmented it looks like a clown right
away so this is pretty. Alright for highlighting today I'm going
to be dipping into the new Anastasia Beverly Hills Aurora glow kit. It looks
something like this. Now for this look today, I don't even know what kind of look I'm doing,
I don't know what I'm doing for my eyes so today I'm going to be dipping into Lyra and
then Helia. I hope I'm saying that correctly and of course I'm going to be using the Anastasia A23
highlighting brush. So let me just start out by... oh come on pigment. This is like a peachy toned
highlighter. It is really powdery I will say that. I mean it's there, it's subtle, you guys are seeing it,
but I'm using to like blinding. So that's cute, it has a little bit of a glow to it. I want a little more of
an intense effect so I'm going to try to dip into Helia, it's like a shapeshifting yellowish green type of color.
Let's put this on top and just see what happens right here. Okay that has a little bit more shine, I think we're getting
somewhere. Oh okay I'm liking how this is looking. Alright, the verdict on this one is that I'm
kind of loving the Nicole one a lot better, this one has a lot of fall out, the colors
were not blinding blinding like I'm used to. Maybe because there brand has always delivered such
intense ones, maybe this is a little bit more subdued but I will have to try putting this
over lipsticks and other things. I've seen a lot of you on Instagram like put
the pigment over lipsticks and stuff like that. So I'm not hating it, I'm just not obsessed with it yet.
The cheeks are cute. Alright. Let's move on. Alright I'm going to shock you guys for brows,
I don't have any new brow products, I’m so sorry. You guys know I'm obsessed with my Benefit
precisely my brow and the Anastasia dip brows but I have no new brow products but the cool
thing about me is I don't have any, so if I don't wanna draw them on,
I don't got to draw them on so, I'm just going to do a really cute
kind of alien soft glamour and I'm going to be using the Urban Decay
eyeshadow prime potion original. I do use some of them but the original... I don't know if
I've ever used this, have I? Maybe once on my channel. So I'm just going to take this
and do it all over my lid. I like to take an eyeshadow brush
and just paint it on before it dries. For eyes today I'm going to be dipping into
the new Jouer cosmetics eyeshadow palette, this is the springtime in Paris matte and shimmer
palette and it looks a little something like this. Now I'm going to start off with going into
this pale kind of ivory shade called petal and I'm going to coat my lids all the way to
the brow bone and just set it to filth. I mean this matte shit has some
pigment honey, thank you Jesus. Alright now I'm going to take a brush
that I normally highlight with, this is the rose gold R33 brush from Morphe.
I like to take this and just kind of bend it up, so it just really goes all into my what we call
the arch? My real brow? That is blended out now we are going to go into the
shade right below it called Camel and just take a little blending
brush and let’s dive in there. So I'm going to tuck this into my crease and
we're going to use this as our transition color. Now I'm going to go back to shade Petal with
the big blending brush and just kind of go over that and soften the edges so we like airbrush and
fucking snatched, damn hoe look at that crease. Now to deepen the crease a little bit, I will be going
into this darker shade right here, it is called Mauve. Now, I don't know if you guys can tell on camera
that this shadow have a lot of fall out. I mean a lot of palettes have fall out,
but the good thing about this one is the pigment isn't there which is amazing.
I'm looking at my eyes like, yes girl! If you're into like natural looks, this palette you can
create endless looks for this. For this for that, for him for her. So I'm just going to put this
right in my crease, now I don't do brow looks, I like to bring down the shadow
all the way down to my nose, just kind of creates a extraterrestrial
feel if you will. Alright now we're going to use the shade Aubergine
which is next to Mauve, it's a more darker color. I'm just going to use a little pencil brush
and just kind of go along my lash line really thinly just to create a little smoky effect
and we're going to be very subtle with this. Now for liner, I found, I know I used a different
shade before so it's kind of a first impression because I've only used one ever but the new Marc Jacob's liners.
These are the eyeliner matte gel eye crayons, these are I think amazing because the one shade
I used the other day, oh my god, was stunning. Now this shade is called Mist Me? Okay. Now, this
is almost like my liquid lip shade Blow Pony. Work Alright lets put this in the water line and
see what happens. Okay the liner is on. Okay, I'm going to take that brush that I just used on
the top and I'm going to go on the bottom. What can I say? So let's go into the Mauve shade here and I'm actually
going to dip a little bit into Amethist which is this purple shade and we're just going to mix and
see what happens. This makes the liner pop even more. This look is like so subdued for me but I'm kind of
living for it. Now 'm just going to kind of flick back. So with no new product, I'm just kind of going
back and giving it a little bit more smoke effect. Alright you guys now this look definitely
needs some mascara and lashes. I'm going to keep it simple
and just keep it like this. But I am going to be using something I've never used before,
which is the new The Shock mascara from YSL. Is that the real name of it? Yes it is. Mascara volume effect.
The Shock. Alright this is in shade, I'm sure black. This doesn't have a shade on here
by the way. 40N901. Great. Alright this is black mascara and looks something like this.
Oh wow. Let's look closely and see if this works. I'm looking at like the difference
of like one eye, that shit is crazy. Alright so I dunked in again
and let's hit the bottoms. Alright now for lashes, today I'm going to be using
the new Kim Thai cake face beauty lashes. These are so stunning and there are called Lion Hearted.
So I'm going to be wearing these today, I'm going to go put them on and I'll be right back.
Alright, the lashes are on. They are massive, dramatic and amazing.
Kind of like Nathan's dick. I think the only thing that's missing is
maybe a little bit of shimmer right here. So I'm going to go back into the Aurora Glow Kit
and I'm just going to hit the shade called Luna. It's kind of like a silvery pretty moment. I'm just
going to dust this on top of the brow bone. Alright guys, I think the only thing left
is lips and some setting spray. I cannot believe this look is almost complete.
So for lips today you guys, I'm going to use a brand-new Jeffree Star Cosmetics
Velour Liquid Lips shade that is coming out for summer, now this summer there are eight
liquid lip shades coming and they of course will be in limited edition packaging.
What color is the packaging this summer? You will have to find out in a few weeks. But I'm
going to use a shade now this is a lab sample so it comes like this when it gets to me. It is one of
my shades you guys and I'm going to be using it today. This color is called Calabasas.
Are you kidding me? I can't. Alright so Calabasas is on the lips, it's dry, I'm living for it.
I cannot wait for you guys to play with this color but okay, before I finish the face, I was looking
at my eyes and I remembered I just got these... now you guys have seen me use the Stila magnificent
eye flitters before on my channel a million times. They've been in my favorites videos, but they
recently put out three dual-chrome colors and I've never tried them before and one of them
is speaking to my soul, it is called Sunset Cove and it looks like this and it does have
a dual-chrome shift effect with like like purple, green, mermaid type of moment. I'm going
to swipe this on my lid and see what happens you guys, Okay I'm just going to tuck that in there just
like that. Oh wow. Come on mermaid fantasy. These aren't as blinding as the pure
glitter ones but they're still really cute. Alright, now I think the only
thing left is setting spray. A lot of you have asked me to review the new
glam glow glow-setter finishing mist. I didn't want to do a whole video dedicated to
a setting spray but we're going to try it right now. Let's see how it mists first. Let's get her pumped up.
Oo, it's really fine, not crazy. So let's give this a whirl. Oh it has that classic cake like smell.
Yes I'm feeling drenched, are we set? We're not done here. How are we looking? Phew, alright you guys,
I think this makeup look is complete. Alright everybody, this completes my
full-face first impressions tutorial, if you guys want to see more of these videos on my channel,
let me know down below with some feedback, some comments, some love, some hate, some fucking
animosities, some spirituality, some heartfelt passion. I think today I've learned a good lesson
that try new things, right? Try new things, whether it's three guys at once, three girls at once,
six people at once, try new things people. Now I am going to say this. One of my favorite things
today, well I'm just going through all my favorites. I really loved the Jouer palette, now it did have
some extreme fall out on some of the shades but everything blended beautifully and I don't think
that the fall out was such a concern for me. It's eyeshadow, that happens with a lot of palettes.
So this has something for everybody. Moving on, I really love these lashes, they are
fucking massive. Imagine if I had brows on, they would like touch up to there. Touch up to there,
to my mother fucking brows girl. Kim Thai, these are amazing, congratulations on your
launch and I got to say you guys, that YSL powder, I know it's a little bit pricy and it might sound a little
absurd because you guys are probably like girl, there's $3 finishing powders. This one was amazing.
My skin still, I've been filming this for a while now, I took a break to go eat downstairs,
mama was getting low blood sugar and I came back up here and I was surprised
that I didn't need to touch up my skin. It wasn't a little greasy in the T-Zone like it normally is.
It was just flat matte amazing. So girl, I don't know what kind of voodoo
is in this shit, but I can't wait to use it. So besides that, I had a lot
of fun filming this. Let me know what products you liked
the best on me and if you forget, everything will be in the description box down
below that I used today. Alright you guys, thank you so much for watching this and
I'll see you on the next one. Bye guys. 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I have no eyebrows and I just had a c-section I need help I really need Jesus and a lot of help okay so my mom met a c-section because I was not ready for this world so I just randomly thought about it today I have hair in my mouth my hair is wet I just got back from the beach and I have no eyebrows and I thought what better time to try out these crazy things that I've seen floating all over the Internet these are brow wigs and they are basically handmade all real human hair that someone put on a very clear base and this is going to give me full eyebrows instantly I don't have to draw them on I don't have to paint them on with a pencil I don't have to do anything except literally pasties onto my skin and I will have beautiful chiseled eyebrows allegedly also I just want to quickly say I cannot believe that we are about to be in September we are literally only less than two weeks away from the RuPaul's Drag Con it is a crazy convention that will be in New York City September 9th and 10th I know a lot of you out there are going I cannot wait to meet you all I will have a huge booth for my brand and I'm also bringing Manny and Laura so come meet us and shop us alright you guys so we're gonna dive into this crazy shit I know that um I've never done brown wings before I've never tried something like this before so if you want to see what the hell is about to happen then keep on watching alright so earlier this year my makeup artist lipstick Nick did a photo shoot for the androgyny eyeshadow palette with me where she turned me into a boy well we'll just say that very androgynous creature and she flipped it and really toned down the makeup and she actually used something very similar to this but had hair on it and I had never done anything like that before and we went to a place that specializes in like special effects for movies and stuff and they weren't the best we had to trim them and it's like a whole mess when you buy the brow wigs they are from a company called a final touch brows and I bought a bunch they're all have different colors so there is like a kind of like light reddish brown there is a blonde and then there's even guy ones which are thick as hell look how big that brow is and then we have light-brown so I got a bunch of colors now these are fifty dollars a piece when I first saw the price tag I was like and then I read it on their website they are a hundred percent human hair they're handmade and they are attached to a skin like base which is virtually invisible when adhered to the skin which of course we're about to find out now the really cool thing about these is that the person that made this and who owns this company created these products specifically to help give confidence back to those who have lost their eyebrows due to illness medical treatment alopecia stress hormonal changes or any other reason for hair loss now we obviously you guys know I shape my brows been shaving them since 10th grade if you ever want to know just look way far back of my channel and talk about it but I've been drawing on my brows since high school I don't like my normal brow hair or I didn't back then I have no idea what they look like now so besides these being fun and to test out on me they're actually really beneficial for people who really do have hair loss or no brows so it's pretty cool on their website there is some really cool before-and-afters I saw if someone that had like literally nothing like me and then it's like BAM now fifty dollars I don't think it's that unreasonable obviously most of you out there have eyebrows or you fill them in with something and you have a little bit of hair but for those of you that don't I don't think the price tag is that high these are reusable they are very high quality and they are handmade which i think is cool whoa whoa whoa okay I misspoke this price point is actually in Australian money now I order so much online you guys I forgot that this company was from Australia because these did take like a week or so to come here to my house so calculating this price tag it would be about $38 plus some change in American okay so it's actually less than fifty excuse me my bad this is in Australian dollars I'm like eh AUD that is not American now on their website it says that these are the most superior false eyebrows on the market I'm like okay we're gonna see about that I think I should probably just shut my mouth and try these on now it does say that you want to oh my god eyebrows will adhere to the skin for up to seven days I'm like girl have these on for more than a damn hour I have a flight in the morning okay I'm scared depending on your skin type environmental such as oily skin and humidity they're supposed to last for seven days so if you live in Florida they might last a day when we're moving eyebrows okay well we don't need to remove them right now we want to put them on okay so it wants to apply that the brow to clean dry skin I literally have to like remove my foundation right here place eyebrow on brow line when satisfied with the position brow should and approximate line be press firmly down until adhesive is dry which would be like a minute god what if you put them on that crooked and you're like fuck for a week there's removal okay so there's also products on the website where if you buy a whole entire kit one pair brows the remover the pre cleaner we're gonna call it this is a little pink solution that you put on prior which I'm gonna assume is very heavy on the alcohol base to make sure your skin is Oh ingredients alcohol water fragrance fuck me we're gonna do the pre cleaner then we are going to this is eyebrow adhesive it says it says latex free and here's what it looks like a literally looks like a top coat for nails oh that smells really intense okay so we're going to wipe off my foundation on my forehead and we're going to stick these brows on of course I can add foundation around the brows later it really doesn't say anything about makeup like can you put makeup on them I'm gonna assume no but we can definitely put our foundation back around it which is a little scary because I do have primer and I have a bunch of mess of my face so I'm just gonna take my finger you guys with a makeup wipe and let's wipe some shit off this is called the new unblended eyeshadow look coming this fall all right so the skin is clean and yes this is a mole or a freckle if you will the pre cleaner says that caution test patch before use and we don't have time to test patch we're going in some redness may occur but it is only temporary you guys I'm getting scared oh that a straight up rubbing alcohol fuck me okay oh wait what am i concerned about rubbing alcohol it's not gonna like kill me so you obviously have to have a clean slate to put on these brows it can't adhere to a foundation powder contour and all of that this looks hilarious look at even after the makeup wipe the rubbing alcohol took off even more makeup okay now we have a real real clean skin great it says that we now need to grab the adhesive and we're gonna pick our brows I think we're gonna do belong don't you guys think I mean I am blond why would I do anything else so let's pop them open and see what the hell they look like I'm like the other really thin name do you look real I will give it that it looks very real already all right I guess we're going to peel off one of the sides and see if it works to make them perfect it says on the site to like line them up and make you know you can make little lines just like if you were to match your real brow and like do a real moment anastacio why aren't you here I know baby so we're just gonna wing it right now and I'll do the my right first oh my god this whoa oh there it is whoo okay so it doesn't feel sticky right now obviously there's no adhesive so I'm just gonna take this and I'm just gonna hold it up to my face okay let's see what happens oh my god it like literally looks so real does that not look like a real human brow holy shit okay come on come on I'm sure already I'm like mmm Giggy all right let me see let's do it up and this is actually really cool I'm freaking out okay so we're gonna put adhesive all over whoa it's sticky it is it's sticky oh my god this is so hard you guys I'm freaking out like do we started ok I see the vision people hold on no one judge me shit ok I want it a little more this way so I'm gonna take it before it's too late because it's gonna be too late very soon I'm gonna move it down a little okay that's probably where I would draw on the brow like right there now it says to hold down so we're gonna press and hold well my camera guy is laughing hysterically at me don't tell me this don't look real right now this shit looks real oh I know I look like ridiculous trying to put this on okay I almost want like more closer to my tear duct but I think it's too late like it's fucking on my damn skin ok so let's let that have a moment let's digest it and let's see how we look where's the mirror cuz I'm not look like a real brow though here's here's the only reason why I think it doesn't look completely real the edges like I get that they're on a clear base but I feel like right here see that I want almost put more adhesive I think that's only fair I don't know how we're gonna get this crazy thing under it I think I'm gonna take a liner brush you guys and just really take it there we're gonna saturate the brush and I think it's only fair to give it a real-world test and put it under the thing and press down and see if it goes away you see that it made it better it definitely made those edges less visible I think we really have one down like woah ok now I will say this now that's on my face I wish I would have moved it a little closer in like I think it's gonna be a little too far apart but hey for a first try not that bad obviously we're gonna have to see if I can match the other side and we can all laugh at me alright the odds of me getting them perfectly symmetrical are a little slim but we're gonna try it anyway alright let's peel off this baby trying to get these lined up y'all it's gonna be a task I know that now I kind of know don't put so much glue on the end until you're like fully ready so then you could at least move it around so you know we're learning alright so let's see what the hell is about to happen cuz I'm very scared [Music] okay I'm not gonna hold them down yet I'm just gonna look okay this one's a little lower so let me move it up oh wow that is crazy okay so here's the thing I don't know obviously they're handmade in there's no way they can be I dent a coal now there's some days we're on a good day I can draw mine on so symmetrical but I know that normal human beings do not have symmetrical eyebrows so I'm not mad at this one it's obviously a little thicker here it starts out smaller how this heads a little thicker right in the ends I'm not mad at it at all so let me finish gluing this down and let's see how she looks so the brow wigs are glued down my only issue obviously this is the first impressions is that this one tapers off a little more like a little here right which you could fill in with makeup and make it more dramatic if you wanted this side of you look it's more of like a straight like Star Trek type of vibe where this one has a little bit more curve with my skull but overall they look very real I think I've wanted to quickly kind of just like put on some foundation around it to like you know let it blend trying to find my damn foundation but I'm just gonna go quickly clean up around here and let's see how we do okay I'm like the more that this is settled in I did foundation you guys I took like a little foundation brush and I like painted around the hair very carefully so the only thing that I had a little bit of an issue with is right here on this side I know my eyeshadow is very close and maybe I didn't wipe off enough makeup but the glue is a little tacky there I tried to mask the brow but overall like if I step back I'm like I think this side way more in my favor this sides a little more like the shape is a little different it's not identical so it kind of is throwing me off it almost looks a little like thicker or the hairs are a little darker so it's kind of tripping me out if I turn right here and I'm like fuck around I like it I really do I'm tripping out no I think it's only fair that I go walk around for a few hours and go show everyone at my office and me and then I'll be back at you try to remove them because 7 days that ain't happenin how are you guys it's been about a few hours I had some Taco Bell and I just keep changing my lipsticks for some no reason at all I need help ok so we are gonna attempt to remove the brow wig it has been not seven days I mean this isn't a cans down for a week obviously I would never do that so to remove let's read this carefully here this is the adhesive remover spray and it says on here do not apply to broken irritated or inflamed skin great this is specially formulated to gently soften and the adhesive bond and remove any residue on the skin once the brows have been removed this can also be used to soak the brow to ten to fifteen minutes oh so if you peel it off in a zig residue it will melt it away which is nice um apply a small amount on a cotton round and clean your skin be sure to clean the skin with an alcohol-based skin toner to remove any traces of oil all right no no I'm shaking this it doesn't even say to shake it let's see what happens I think we literally it says to like soak it with the hair alright let's see what happens we put on this brow first earlier in the video it's only fair to remove that one first oh it is oily oh just take off my eye shadow look at that BAM whoa and is it gonna peel huh oh oh there on there you guys this shit is crazy oh oh let me try let me try it oh oh shit there it goes oh oh okay if anyone is in to peel off porn how is that for the brow okay so that obviously came off fairly easy oh yeah it is there is some sticky ass residue on my damn skin where is that spray damn my skin is red under here can you still feel the glue it's actually all gone okay so that removal process is a little easier than I thought my skin hates me so I'm gonna wipe off the oil and I'm gonna put on no other makeup because it's it's already a mess alright let's take the other side and let's remove it that is so crazy okay for someone that has like had no brows most of their life that was such a weird and satisfying experience because it actually looked really real like when I went downstairs and I went out into the real world people were like oh my god I'm so used to having them drawn on it's kind of bizarre so do the brow wigs work they fucking work you guys I will give it up now I know most of you just wanted to see me use it and you're probably never gonna try them because you all have real hair but I had to give them a whirl and I'm pleasantly surprised so I do want to put it on the record I'm a mess you guys but I will say on the record that the final touch Brow's are jeffree star approved I really think this is such a innovative cool idea and I will give it up to this brand they looked real I kind of want to do these ones one day because they're so big and bold and I know a lot of you out there have asked me to even draw on my brows bigger than I normally do and I'm just like I'm not a big like thick brow person I might give you the world you guys have convinced me all right you guys thank you so much for watching this crazy review if you want to sound off in the comments section down below let me know your thoughts let a bitch know what you thought of this look at this looks like have a sunburn on my face now which I probably do I need my foundation alright thank you guys so much for watching I will see you on the next one mwah 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel now today we are doing nothing makeup related I kind of just wanted to turn the camera on sit here for a little bit and just talk to you guys I know I mentioned on snapchat a week or two ago just kind of about like letting walls down and letting you guys know a little bit more about me personally I know for the last year and a half as I have entered the youtube realm I have really just stuck to makeup makeup makeup and I know I did a video like six months ago that was called the tattoo diaries part one where I kind of let you guys in on my life and so many of you love that video sorry that I haven't done a follow up to it yet it is definitely coming but um there's been a lot of like crazy rumors and drama and just a bunch of negative shit all over the internet about I mean it's always about me but a lot of it recently is just about me and Nathan and I just kind of wanted to sit down here and talk about my relationship everything about it and just address a lot of rumors that I've been seeing but before we even dive into that let's talk about the elephant in the room I know I don't mean this fucking beautiful highlight I'm talking about my hair this is actually not a wig so for everyone that does not follow me on snapchat my hair colorist David he shot a few day because you transformed me baby we were actually going to do like a hot coral or like a peachy type of coral vibe I was like I want like peach hair I want peach so we started to list out the hot pink and it came out like so easy I have really good genetics in my family when it comes to hair well not hairline insert joke there but we always have really strong hair and our family's like you can diet bleach it flat iron and do whatever and it still so healthy so I said you know what David let's take it there so we were doing the hair and all of a sudden all the pink was gone and I was like oh my god you guys I haven't had blonde hair in literally nine years I used to bleed to my own hair in high school I used to have like white platinum blonde and I've had pink and green and so many other colors throughout the years definitely feels a little weird to me right now like when I looked in the mirror the other day I was like oh my god the next morning I was like holy shit who is this it's crazy you know this feels like a part of me is like missing sounds weird but it's definitely something that I'm going to probably keep for a few months and then I'll do my peach idea but for now I'm having a little blond Ambition moments do blondes have more fun I guess we'll find out so I'm not really sure how to start this video but I guess I'm going to just address a lot of things that I've been seeing and hearing and just like have been witnessing all over the internet now it's really crazy because when you are dating someone or in love with someone you really don't hear all of the I guess negative stuff but when you live your life online like I do and you are all over YouTube and the internet and Instagram snapchat and Facebook obviously my life is in front of an audience and I know that but it's crazy when complete strangers try to pick apart my relationship or make things up and try to convince people that this is real or like I've literally seen videos of me and Nathan where someone has literally just made up something out of their ass and it literally never happened wasn't even true and there's like a thousand comments on this video of people like debating it and talking about it and agreeing with it or disagreeing and it's just like blows my mind that my relationship is even like that exciting for people but then I have to realize you know me and Nathan have been building a story on YouTube and we have been together for about two years now and a few months and so much has happened when I introduced him on my channel I have no idea where the future would take us and here we are you know we have a house in Calabasas together we have four dogs we have this amazing life but a lot of you only see us you know reviewing face masks or you know on trips together and you really don't know what is like under the surface or what is behind the pink curtain as I'm going to call it at the end of the day do I really care what people say about me no but then there comes to a point where actually maybe I kind of do on some subjects because when people try to tell me your boyfriend only with you for the money or your boyfriend has a weird vibe or your boyfriend just wants you know your bank account it's so crazy because I'm like where did you even get that from so let me rewind to early 2014 when I started talking to Nathan and met him for the very first time at the time I was single for like seven years and we'll talk about that later but when I met him I had really just started my company I was not wealthy I was not a millionaire I did not have a crazy brand I did not have a YouTube channel I didn't have any of these things so it just kind of makes me sad when people try to throw that card in and I think a lot of people hate to see others happy we are in a very weird time in the world where other people's success or happiness makes other people upset jealous angry and I can't really understand that whenever I saw other people more successful than me or had nicer things in me or we're doing something I wanted to do or I never looked at it as like oh my god fuck them like fuck this shit I can't believe they're doing it I'm not it made me want to work harder and made me motivated but I know a lot of people aren't like that so Nathan met me before I had money plain and simple so please let's move on from that subject and I don't know what people think like you think he just logs into my bank account every day or has a debit card and it's go shopping all day you know it's really funny and I'm just going to keep it so real as usual when I met Nathan he had no idea you guys what any designer label was he is a small-town guy from Michigan and people don't really give a fuck about Louboutin and Chanel out there they're literally trying to like pay the rent and you know work and try to find a job and just you know everyone's pretty normal out there and they are not wrapped up into social media or any of this bullshit so it trips me out how people try to I guess say things that are literally a lie and it's crazy when people make story time videos about me and Nathan and they'll and they have you know Adsense which if you don't know what that is it's basically ads on their video which makes them money so while they're degrading me and my man they're making money off of it so it's like you're making money off of people's you know sadness or anger or pain or lies and it's just kind of crazy like we live in a whole nother world to get back on track before I met Nate I was single for a long time and the reason why is because I am relief not attracted to anyone but what we call in this world as a straight male or a nor mole dude and what I mean by that is like you know I am really into straight guys and I know that it's going to not be surprising to a lot of you if you have been someone that has followed me for a long time you know I come from the music world if you are unfamiliar with my music career I did music for eight to nine long years I traveled the world I met you know a million people I had I grew an amazing fan base and this is way before ever how to make a blind or did YouTube from just traveling the world I would always fall in lust I'm gonna sit less because to me I have never been in love until now and I really I guess that really hit me and I really realized that when I met Nathan I had never felt like this with someone before I'd never had that strong of a connection so you know from just traveling everywhere and meeting dudes all the time and being around that world for so long I really kind of fell into a trap of always being someone that was kept like the secret and when you are someone like me who is you know I get asked all the time even every day on my channel you guys I get comments are you a guy are you a girl are you trying to gender are you trying to transition what are you and I don't even know how to answer that like obviously I was born a male I just feel like I'm Jeffrey being someone that is like me that is a guy that looks like a woman right I keep doing this because so many people are not into labels these days and I love that I'm all about that you do you call yourself whatever you want whatever you believe in I think that is the beauty and the freedom of you know living is we can be whoever we want to be I have always been into straight men and the problem with that my entire life is I never found real love because straight men behind closed doors they love people like me they love hooking up they love having fun they love the relationship as long as other people don't know as long as her family doesn't know as long as their friends don't know so imagine you guys always being the secret and never fully being accepted and never fully loved I was tired of that I was really really tired of it so I went on a long hiatus from dating people hooked up with people had fun has little you know flings in little relationships I think if you date someone for two months that is not your boyfriend you literally were hanging out with for a few months it didn't work out so I don't like to call people my boyfriend if I dated you for a few months I think that's silly until I met Nate I'd never had I guess real real love and I get asked all the time how can someone that is a straight male beaten to you men are into me and I know it's kind of shocking to some people a lot of you were like girl we know the t we already know it you know rappers and actors and all these people behind closed doors are hooking up with guys that look like chicks and and transgender people and it's a very common thing maybe not where you are from but in California it is a very big and I've traveled the world you guys I've had a million guys married single divorce all have hit on me and you know if that's just sexuality you know we can have a sexuality video some other time I would definitely have to do one so when I met Nathan he had only ever been with chicks and if you guys go back on my channel and watch a lot of our Q&amp;A is you will find a lot of Nathan's history and he even explains it a little that you know he's always been attracted to guys that look like women but in Michigan there is no Jeffrey stars there are no Nikita dragons there are no Gigi gorgeous there there there are none of us beautiful you know creatures and those beautiful women in Michigan so I think when they found me he was like oh my god this is like I don't know I don't know what he thought really I'm I guess we can ask him one day but he was attracted to me obviously he hit me up and I was really attracted to him something about him drew me in and I was like okay like let me give this guy a chance I had no idea what to expect you guys he flew to LA for two days literally a weekend he's like I'm gonna come hang out let's just chill whatever I thought really we're going to be really real I thought we were just gonna hook up say goodbye have a good weekend together and then that was that and I'll never forget when he pulled up to my house and I locked eyes with him I was like whoa I don't know what it was I don't even how to explain the feeling of like a real bond like this connection that just like hit me and I was almost like breathless two and a half years later I can say that I think I have finally not think I know truly deep down that I have real love and I don't even know how to explain it love is such a weird thing I know a lot of you out there have children you're married you're divorced you're single there are so many walks of life out there watching this and I just want to let you know that took me 29 years to find someone decent enough that respected me that you know I wanted to give my time to and you know Nate has had to deal with a lot he's had to deal with me you know growing as a brand as a person as a you know influencer as a celebrity whatever you want to call me I think all those words are silly but we do love to label things and it's also important I get it but whatever you want to call me is that Nate has grown with me kids you know been with me since day one when I even wanted to start a channel we have filmed videos together that have had millions and millions of views and I think a lot of you were enamored by the fact that Nate loves women but he also is now dating me and I think a lot of you are tripped out by that and it's crazy how many girls and women out there are still direct messaging me on Instagram and it's bizarre to me like there's girls you guys that literally write let me know when you're done with that faggot come back to the pussy and I'm like girl I just think it's sad that people want to try to ruin a relationship or try to break it up but the thing about Nate is that there is so much trust like I wish you guys could see him day to day and see what a beautiful strong amazing nice genuine like person that he is because you know I know that you guys see a fraction of what it is on YouTube and online but um you know we have full transparency you know I don't know how other couples rate are but like we really don't ever argue like there's really not much to ever argue about everything is always happy and amazing and I've never felt like this before it's crazy to think that other people out there want to hurt a relationship or people want him to you know try to write back so you can screenshot it and make a news story and it's just like oh my god I couldn't imagine being that unhappy with myself where I would want to hurt others I guess I can't relate to that so for all you people out there that like to threaded diem other people of men you need help you really do and when you grow up later in life you will realize how dark and sad that aspect really is I could never imagine doing that to someone so I think to kind of go back to what I'm really trying to say here is I want to let you guys know that I am in love and I think that it's so funny to say on a video because I've never felt these feelings before but you know here we are two years plus later and I finally still accept it I can't believe that someone accepts me for all my flaws you all know I'm not perfect you know we all have our personality what we're going to call them defects or you know we have our issues and we've had our pasts any we all come from something and we all come from a you know whether it's a good or dark past and you know when you meet someone they have to figure that out we have to realize like oh my god can I really accept this person for everything that they are and also you guys being in the spotlight or being in front of an audience all the time can be difficult for a relationship and there's always so many factors from all angles coming in whether it's negative or positive and Nathan just loves me completely for me he's accepted all of my flaws and you know I'm not one to always get emotional but it's crazy to sit here and think about that like you know it took me 29 years to finally feel accepted by a man that really is compassionate and has real love and I get asked all the time you know how to make parents still about you how to lose family feel about you and you know it's crazy that they are all so open-minded amazing individuals they don't look at me as anything but just Jeffery you know a normal person who is you know dating their son and they love me it's so fun to go to Michigan you know me and Nate just bought a house and Grand Rapids and shout out to all my Michigan people in the man I'll be there very soon on and off all throughout the year and it's cool to just you know go to Michigan and you know go to the gun range and you know go to restaurants and go camping and hiking and all these fun things and just be a normal person at the end of the day once the makeup is all off and I'm just sitting there they accept me for me I don't know you guys I guess I just wanted to share that and I don't know if you know I don't really do story time videos on my channel so if this is a little jumbled I'm sorry but I just want to say thank you to everyone out there that watches my channels that watch my reviews in my makeup tutorial and that trust me for my opinion you know that's what I'm here for and I love you guys so much thank you for watching this video and of course if you guys want more story time videos please let me know in the comment section down below and I just also want to say a side note I know a lot of you have been seeing snapchats with like jewelry no me and Nathan are not engaged I have been wearing rings for a while now he has a ring on his right hand and I think every time he likes tap shots it like flips it so you guys are likely died his left hand he engaged I don't know if I ever want to get married maybe I'll get married in a year maybe I'll never get married I don't know yet but I do know that we are happy how we are right now and we don't need a ceremony or a piece of paper to change any of that besides that no kids no marriage a lot more dogs and a lot more adventures we do love traveling the world and I really appreciate all of you guys that watch our vlogs and everything we do on the road it's just so fun to be able to travel with your best friend and you know wake up every morning to someone that can look at you with no makeup and a bare face and just say I love you um I think that is one of the most rewarding feelings of the human being is to actually experience that so alright guys that is it for today and I don't know I told myself we're not going to cry on YouTube where I can require on this channel so I am going to let you guys go for now and I will see you on the next one mwah bye guys 
What’s up everybody? 
Welcome back to my channel. Today we are doing my May 
holy grails and fails. And we have a lot of stuff to talk
 about today, a lot of makeup. Now skincare, I really didn’t update my skincare 
routine or change it, or really do anything new. So today we’re going to be diving
 into strictly… strictly-dickly… no, strictly makeup and some fashion items. I know I didn’t do an April favorites video, where… like where is the time going,
 you guys? The year is half over. We’re about to be in like… 
we’re about to be in summer. I cannot believe June is like around 
the corner, it’s here, I can’t breathe.  I’m just like “What the fuck!?” But the good thing about is June 
is that my summer collection, the Chrome Jeffree Star Cosmetics full collection
 will be launching around the end of June. I feel like… I feel like I know the date and I should just tell you guys right 
now even before the reveal videos. So June 24th the Summer Collection 
will be launching on my website, and of course all of my retailers 
will have it as well. I will be doing a swatch reveal 
of everything next week. I know you guys are watching and 
you’re waiting for it and you’re like… Besides that you guys, April 
and May have been so insane. My collaboration with Manny MUA exceeded
 our expectations and it just exploded and it sold way quicker than we thought. So I just wanna say personally thank you so 
much for all the support on that collaboration. I know a lot of you are asking us to please bring back 
the Eclipse Highlighter and the Daddy Lipstick. If you do not know, I am shook
 Liquid Lip is still on my site. There are some left, but the other
 two items are gone. So maybe y’all should tweet Manny 
and say “Bitch, bring it back!” Also I was just in Saint-Tropez, which is the south 
of France and I went with the brand Jouer, which I’m gonna talk about 
them later in the video. But I had such an amazing 
time on that brand trip. So I got to bond with other amazing beauty 
influencers and it was such an incredible trip. You guys, I think that travelling 
is just so fulfilling. So a lot of you have been asking me to do more 
videos with Nate and those are definitely coming. We have a lot of cool 
stuff in the works. But if you guys haven’t any video ideas or 
anything you want to see of me and Nathan, tweet me or sound off below. And I know a lot of you have been wondering 
if Zack is going to be returning on my channel, sadly he moved back to Michigan 
California, it did not really work out. And me and Nate... 
ahh you guys. No tint, no shade though, 
I just love living alone. I mean four dogs are amazing, those are our babies but there’s nothing like living 
alone and having sex whenever the fuck you want. On the couch, on the floor, on the kitchen 
stove, Adam and Eve and the… but anyway, yeah. But the good news is you guys, 
me and Nate have been travelling a lot and we’ve been visiting his hometown 
of Grand Rapids, Michigan. And I don’t know, I might want a house 
there, we’ll see what happens. Everyone in Michigan, watch out bitch 
'cause Jeffree Star is coming! Alright you guys, if you want to see my May 
Holy Grails and Fails then keep on watching. But if not I’ll see you on the next one. Alright you guys, let’s dive 
into some makeup. I’m a little shook to the ground 
at myself because I am obsessed with the Maybelline 
Dream Liquid Mousse Foundation. Now listen, for a foundation 
to be 8.99 and drugstore, I am like shocked at how 
sickening this formula was. I know some of you wanted me to try the Fit Me 
Maybelline Foundation which I have and I did buy at Ulta, but this one spoke to me and I have
 been wearing this in like five videos. You’ll never know because it looks so snash, but you
 should know because this foundation is so incredible. I don’t know what it is, it just looks so 
airbrushed and pretty, but not matte and dry. It’s like very like, I don’t know, dull like and 
like stunning and I am obsessed with it. I have been using shades 10 and 20 now 
for the last three weeks and I’m hooked. This one number 20 is like my exact 
shade and I am such a fan of this. So shout out to Maybelline, 
girl work! Alright you guys, so Marc Jacobs Beauty has this 
new highlighter that came out about a month ago. It is infused with coconut and 
I’m just gonna show you. Because I can run my mouth all day,
 but until you see this in action… So basically this is a liquid of course, 
obviously you can see that. It is for the body, face, you can 
put it in your foundation. But just look at this finish. That is literal pure metal. Now imagine that on your neck, on your body…
 I’m just gonna put it on my neck anyway. Like are you kidding me? It’s just so stunning in the sunlight. I mean I put a lot on my hand cause 
I’m a sick bitch and I love the bling. But if you just suddenly do this or rub
 it on your legs for a photoshoot, or you’re just on the beach and 
you want everyone to stare at you. Like look at that. Ahh! 
Oh, It’s just so stunning and mmm it smells so good. So this one is the… 
this one is called Dew You? So these are coconut 
gel highlighter drops. And these are limited edition I think, so if you’re 
watching anyone from Marc Jacobs Beauty, please make them permanent. Alright now listen, for the month 
of May I used this a lot. Now the brand Natasha Denona 
which is pretty bomb, I will say that. I have been using it for a while now, for like two 
years and I’m obsessed with the formulas. Now I know Natasha is finally on Sephora.com
 and in some stores, which is so amazing. Girl I’m so proud of you, congratulations. Her eyeshadows are unreal, the formula,
 the pigmentation are just on point. So when she put out a new palette 
you know mom had to have it. So this is the Sunset Palette. Now besides the astronomical price point,
 now I’m just gonna keep with you guys. This palette is $129, I know. Let me let you all roll your eyes 
right now, let me give you a second. You guys done? Okay So after you get past the price point, 
i swear to god I don’t know what it is. The formulas are just a-mazing! You see I’ve been really going
 in on these colors a lot. When Manny did my makeup for 
his channel he used this palette. I’ve been using this a lot. I did a no brow look a few 
weeks ago and you all were like “Where’s the tutorial?” So I think I will definitely have to do one. I just love this brand, 
I think it’s really cool and the colors though, 
I mean Hi! Alright you guys, now let’s 
talk about blinding highlighters. I’m sure some of you were like 
“Bitch what the hell is on this cheek?” It is from the brand Jouey and they 
have these amazing powder highlighters. And girl, let me just tell you
 something about this company. I love Indie brands that create amazing 
formulas and have really cool packaging. I’ve met the owner Christina about 
mmm I think like a year ago and we just really bonded and our love
 of makeup has brought us really close. So I’m about to… before I even 
show you these highlighters… well yeah, let me show 
you the highlighters. But I do have something to say. For the first time ever, I don’t want 
anyone to fall off their damn seat, but for the first time ever 
I have asked a brand if I could have a code for all of you guys 
because I really believe in this brand, I love them and they are a smaller brand. You know they’re not in Sephora and Ulta, 
but definitely like me where they are you know, they do have some retail but they’re very
 online driven and they’re a really cool company.  So after trying all their products for a while I saw 
that Manny and a few other people had codes and I was like “You know what, I know 
I am never about the code life”. I really don’t want you guys to ever think
 “Oh my god Jeffree’s doing this for money or he’s doing codes to get money.” Like on the realist to you guys, 
my brand has blessed me so much and the reason I don’t do codes is because
 I don’t need to make the money, and I know I don’t want that to come off as 
pretentious or sounding any type of way. And regardless of anything I say, people are gonna
 articulate in their own tone and their own way. But I don’t do codes because I wanted
 to always keep it really honest and I always wanted 
you guys to be like, “You know what, Jeffree is the one bitch that isn’t
 getting paid to say this is cool or this is great.” So I think the only way to achieve 
doing a code was one simple route. So I asked Jouer if I could donate all the money 
that I’m making from a code to a charity and they were like “Oh my god! 
Are you for real? That would be amazing!” So I am not gonna keep any of the money, 
I wanna donate it 100% to a charity that I believe in. And in Los Angeles there is 
the LGTB Community Center. Basically this center in Los Angeles I have visited, 
I used to live around the corner from it. It is the world’s largest provider of programs 
and services for the LGTB community. And they help people 
from all around America and I just think it’s such a cool 
place that I’ve even visited myself. I used to live around the corner from the center 
a long time ago when I first moved to LA, and it’s just something that 
I’m really passionate about. So if you want to try the brand of course,
 I am giving you this offer to use my code and it will of course be going 
to a good cause. And I will be filming going there soon 
and I can’t wait to surprise them. So if you use the code you do get 15% off. And they just released this new line 
called the Skinny Dip Collection. If you guys saw me on the trip on Snapchat 
in Saint-Tropez about a week ago. You saw my cheekbones looking something
 like this and this is one of their highlighters. It is called Skinny Dip. As you see mom has been 
going heavy in the pan. Now this formula… let me just 
take a clean finger here. Like you see that? Oooh bitch! I’m just gonna put this on my hand so 
you guys can really see what is going on. Hi. So if you are someone that loves a blinding
 metallic glow, you’re gonna love this. Let me do a few more swatches. This is shade Citrine. Girl, first of all there’s that. Second of all, there’s that. Ahh they’re so pretty! I’m like obsessed with the formula. I mean look at the way it glows you guys. I am obsessed! Alright last but not least is from one of
 my favorite brands, Benefit Cosmetics. Now they recently put this Cheek Parade 
Palette out about a month and a half ago. Oh my god! I have been 
using it ever since. And let me just show 
you what it looks like. So of course it has it’s classic 
Hoola bronzer here, and now there is a new 
shade the Hoola Lite. I love mixing these all over forehead, cheeks, jaw,
 nose, taint, feet, wherever you want to put it baby. Recently they also put out this 
new blush called GALifornia. I mean as a Californian native, 
I love the name. And it is just such a beautiful like 
rosy peachy type of tone, I love it. I’m wearing a little bit right here. And Dandelion, why I have 
been putting this in my crease, I’m kind of living for it. And for someone that travels a lot, I love bring this 
because you have bronzers and blush in one. and you don’t have to have 
a bunch of compacts around. So I’m into the travel things. I used to not be into the travel type of 
packaging and now it’s convenient bitch. Alright let’s dive into 
some fashion now. Oh my god, girl! First of all sunglasses, every time that
 I wear big sunglasses on Snapchat, I get so many people screenshotting it and tweeting
 me “What brand? What brand is this?” Oh my god. So the top two… 
I’m gonna pick them today. They are… one is from Chanel. These are the Matrix glasses. Let me just put them on for ya. And basically as you see as you move your head,
 they look like the intro to the movie Matrix, where all the green numbers 
are falling down. And oh my god, I love them. They’re huge and obviously if you don’t have a horse
 face like me and no eyebrows, you may not like them. But I love big glasses. I love big anything really. Second pair of glasses that I got such like a high 
number of requests of what the hell were they, were these beautiful huge 
silver chrome aviators. And this is from the brand Versace. Oh my god I love these. Now sometimes I like glasses that have 
an opening cause you can see the highlight. So when you’re doing selfies or pictures,
 your glow really gets to have its moment. With these the glow is covered, so you 
gotta sacrifice the glow or—I don’t know. But I am obsessed with these ones. I think I’ve been wearing them for three weeks 
straight and they also come in red and black. So I might need those. Now it’s time to talk about the elephant 
in the motherfucking room. So this is the Chanel boomerang which… 
here’s what’s crazy about life. Now look, some may call me controversial, 
some may call me… I don’t know what people call me. Well I do, but I’ve heard it all 
so I really lost track. The other day I bought this 
from Chanel on Rodao, shout out to Gabby I love you girl. First of all, it’s a boomerang, okay? 
In my head as an American citizen, I have seen boomerangs 
since I was a child and they have been used for leisure 
activities from dawn to dusk girl. So, when I bought this I did not 
think anything of it. I snapped it, I was throwing it around in 
my backyard, I even chipped it. Let’s just zoom in right there. 
Look at those chips girls mhmm! That’s what happens when you throw 
a boomerang and it lands on your roof, which was kind of hilarious. 
But hey, fuck it. Now I bought this 
because I love Chanel. I am a fashion whore and I just 
love anything fun or unique. So, I also bought Chanel tennis 
racquets, tennis balls, paddle balls. But of course, the boomerang 
just turned into a circus. Now I am really sorry if anyone 
was offended by this. At the end of the day I bought 
this with my own money because I thought it was cool and me 
and Nate love to do outdoor activities. What I didn’t expect was for TMZ 
to follow me at the airport asking about it. CNN.com emailing me asking 
for a quote of what I think about this and it’s a culture appropriation. 
And I’m sitting there like oh my god. I literally woke up the next morning 
to literal hell you guys and I had no idea it was going 
to be this big of like anything. Not even a big deal, 
anything at all. I really thought cool I’m just showing 
something cute on Instagram. I know a lot of you were like “Girl, that is 
from an indigenous Austrian culture. That is the whole thing 
for hundreds of years.” And I did a lot of Googling 
and I’m like okay. Now the price point 
was a little crazy yes. Did I spent $1300 
on a piece of wood? Yeah but that’s my own money that I worked for, 
so who the fuck cares what I buy? Here’s what I don’t like after 
doing some deep research, because I’m not a boomerang 
educator or you know, that in tune with the subject, 
Walmart.com has been selling boomerangs 
for 20 years for $10. How come no one cared? Boomerangs 
have been sold at Toys R Us for years. Boomerangs are for sale at Target, 
everywhere, every store in America. They are literal… like they are common 
things here in America. But I think because it’s me… because it involves me, 
it’s always gonna be a circus and people always wanna try and 
drag and make this into like a thing. We always call it the thing in my house. 
Oh, here we go girl. So, I am sorry if I offended anyone, 
that was obviously not my intention and I’m sorry if anyone 
took it like that. But I think that there are other 
horrible things going on, on this planet and 
in this world that I think people worrying about a piece 
of wood is just really sad. There are so many you know, horrible 
tragedies happening every day and so many things in the news. You know, 
I think we live in such dark times and there’s always something 
so horrendous on the news. I’m like girl, like literally me buying 
a piece of wood should not be on TMZ. But hey, people love entertainment 
and they just trying to fuck with me. So great you had your fun, 
moving on next. Alright you guys, last but not least I’m gonna 
talk about another Chanel product, because they are one of my favorite brands 
and just some little news drama is gonna turn me from shopping. So, Chanel is one of the first luxury high 
fashion brands to make an LED purse. What the fuck does that even mean? 
Maybe you saw it on my Snapchat, which if you don’t follow me 
it’s linked down below. But Chanel recently put out these gorgeous 
boy bags and they are LED activated. I’m gonna slowly dim the lights for you guys 
so you can see this bitch in action. Oh my god! It is so amazing what technology 
can do nowadays, it’s just so cool. I am such a fashion lover. 
When I first saw these, I was like Ahh! Now you open the bag like this 
and it has a switch inside where you can change 
the patterns of the LEDs. Let me change one for you guys. Oh my god these 
look so sickening! Alright so I changed the pattern 
and I’m gonna turn off all the lights so, you guys can see 
this in action. Ahh yes! So basically, it does like a million things, 
it changes to different colors. Let me just open it and I will switch it again. 
I mean come on you guys. The other day I was in a club and 
I turned this on, people were gagging. And by the way, I go to the club 
about once a year now. Look how cool this is, 
it’s like raining down. It almost feels like I’m in a Vegas 
nightclub or like an EDM show. I think this might be one of my favorite ones, 
like all the little Cs bouncing around. Alright, let’s talk about a few things that didn’t 
really work out for me over the last few months. Oh my god girl! Now listen, 
y’all know Christian Louboutin is one of my favorite shoe 
designers on earth. I’m beating that horse by saying that. 
I have a closet full of red bottoms. But when it comes to the makeup you guys, 
it is very on the misses for me. It is Mrs. Oh my god no thank you. 
Now this mascara $70 underwhelming, nothing special and 
I’m not just like being shady. I’m not trying to sound rude, 
it’s just the facts. And I think people are a little 
afraid of honesty now days. But listen, I don’t care who watches this video, 
at the end of the day this for $70, no mam. And the second item that definitely flopped 
for me… oh my god. Jeevan Ju Beauty, girl. Now the foundation that they 
put out recently was very pretty. It was very on the more like 
light coverage side so, I’ve only used it a few times 
since reviewing it. But this beauty sponge… 
it looks amazing. When I saw it online I was like Oooh! It looks 
dangerous like… and if you wet it, it expands. But for some reason it did not distribute 
the powder and the foundation correctly. It was very streaky on camera, 
you could really tell and sometimes beauty lights are 
a little more forgiving. Girl, there was nothing forgiving 
about this except my skin. And it just was not a hit for me. 
I was really disappointed in it. I love the shape of it, but it just 
did not work for me. Alright you guys, those were my holy 
grails and fails for the month of May. I am ready to dive into summer, 
I’m sure all of you are. So, I will see you guys 
very soon in my next video. So, watch out for that summer collection, 
everything will be revealed soon. Alright you guys, I will see you 
on the next one. Mwah! 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel now today's video is highly anticipated the whole makeup community is so excited for the Massino Sephora collection including myself now I know we have all seen where is it where is the infamous bear do you guys click the video for the Massino bear eyeshadow palette when I saw this girl when I saw this on Instagram I about died this is the cutest packaging I've probably ever seen and I know this is going to be such a hot item for the fall and holiday season now so 4 has teamed up with one of my favorite brands of course you guys have seen me wear you know clothes all over my channel I love the designer Jeremy Scott he is a fashion God and he has turned fashion upside-down with Barbies and bears and fast food and just turned it into a whole pop culture phenomenon and I'm living for it am i cute shirt you know I had to wear it because of today's video of course we are going to go through the entire thing from the lip glosses and the brushes to the palettes to the highlighter and we're going to see if it's jeffree star approved but before we get into that I do want to quickly announce and talk about something really really exciting if you have not already seen it on social media I did a really cool project with some other Beauty influencers and Benefit Cosmetics BAM here is the beauty stowaways influencer kit I am so excited to be a part of it you guys so if you have not heard me man emu a Laura Lee Nicole Guerrero and Karen have teamed up with benefit and basically this isn't like a collab like we created the products this is more of like an endorsement so we all got to pick our favorite product that we are obsessed with from benefit now let me turn this over I'm sure know not a lot of you are going to be surprised that I am a roller lash mascara now the cool thing about roller lash you guys besides it actually being amazing and working is that it was one of the very first ever jeffree star approved products on my channel and it really holds a special place in my heart so you can get this kit and you could get the roller lash by itself with the limited geoffery packaging now of course you guys know this is my favorite mascara on earth I was kind of in like a crazy flashback moment because literally 10 years ago I was buying some of my first makeup in a Sephora in Orange County California and it's just surreal to remember like scraping up dollars to buy an urban decay lip gloss and here we are literally 10 years later and I am teaming up with a brand and my face will be in every Sephora in America it's just like a surreal insane moment so we recently flew to Vegas and revealed the entire thing and it was such a fun and just surreal moment for all of us they think so right now these are available on Sephora calm and then starting August 17th they will be available in stores now the kit is really cool because it comes with a mini travel size so you get this whole thing for $32 and let me just pull up the mini you guys look how cute the little travel roller lash is it is stunning so adorable and I just can't wait for you guys to play with it so if you want to see me try out the whole entire bastino so for our collection and keep on watching all right there is a lot in this collection so we're going to slowly go through it all and of course I think we should open up the brushes first and use a few of them when we create our eye look now here is what the brushes look like now this set comes with five brushes they are all gold of course as you can see they have the amazing the ski note bear heads on the end and this set retails for $54 okay so here's what I was afraid of which is not the case as I was afraid that they were going to feel really cheap but girl with the bear and even this feels heavy and nice I love the bear it's like mmm oh okay these are soft for synthetic bristles Wow on the back of the box you guys it says that there is an all-over face brush a cheek brush a highlight brush and a crease and shadow brush okay so I'm going to assume this is the all-over one of course now you guys know I did my foundation contour lush brow and powder today and then we have the this must be the cheek brush love it and then of course the highlighting brush which is what I'm most looking forward to today is this little guy okay and then of course we have the crease and shadow brushes now these do feel a little more lightweight obviously they're way thinner and smaller but they still have a good weight to them next up we have this mosquito bear highlighter now this retails for $22 that is not bad at all it has 0.35 ounces in it which is 10 grams of product now in the back of it that says this highlighter duo boasts 2 shades that radiates nothing but love so here's the thing about this collection is a lot of stuff on the back doesn't really say like it's supposed to be blinding it's supposed to be subtle I am on the website and let me just click here as we unbox this baby by the way the packaging and all the stuff is really really cool you guys it's very personal from the brand and I love all the accents of the bears to the logo - this is not a mosquito toy on the side it just really fits with a brand and I love all the little details alright and here is what the bear looks like now on sephora.com there is no really info about this product it really just says that this limited-edition collaboration unifies a playful essence of mosquito with the beauty expertise of Sephora let's just open this up of course we're going to put this on our cheeks I'm just going to take two clean fingers and just go in right here bear dome and here is what they look like okay so there looks to be a little bit more on the subtle side I guess we can do little moments right here BAM that is what that looks like and of course on the skin it could look different we will put that on in a minute but it looks to be like a soft kind of diffused highlighter which you all know I'm more into the blinding ones next product is BAM this is the mosquito bear eye mask now on the back of this it says a perfect sleep mask to wear while jet-setting to the Milan fashion shows that's cute this is actually really really adorable definitely might be wearing this to my trip this week to Bora Bora now I don't want to mess up my face makeup so I'm not what we're going to put this on might as well you know I'm gonna be on a plane with this on my head and everyone's going to be like well the next product which when I saw this you guys I about fell out of my seat this is the Massino bear lip gloss chain BAM look at how beautiful this is now I haven't opened it yet but that's that's some real jewelry this lip set includes six shades that represent all of the cities that were held near India Tyminski knows heart this is actually a really good value I know that the lip glosses are more on the mini side but this is only $32 I'm like oh my god how the hell they do that alright so here's what it looks like pulled out let's take out the Garba so this is this bear chain oh my god this now I knew the box is heavy when I was holding it but this is heavy like it's nice it feels really nice now here's the thing that you guys or I didn't even know when I saw it was actually a lip gloss goes in the head so if you want to wear a lip gloss around your neck you definitely can so here are all 6 shades of course I'm gravitating towards the hot pink one think all you do is put the lip gloss right and pop o it like presses in like it's there like it kind of clicks in really nice now once we do the eyes we will test these out as well and see if they're any good now let's get to whatever one really wants to see all right now I think what everyone is dying to see if it works or not is the crazy viral mosquito bear eye shadow palette now of course when I saw this I was like why is this the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life this bad boy is a 48 dollars retail this palette has 21 shades I'm like damn for that price point that is not bad with matte satin and shimmer finishes alright so I think we got to open her up right now and see what the hell is in this box here is the bare eyeshadow palette I do want to show it off and let you guys know how thick it is so it is a sick-ass palette so this entire thing the bare part just has a mirror and then of course the eyeshadow are all on the bottom so this is a bulky ass thing let's open her up boo boo and here is what you get the mirror is honestly a Norma's and let's zoom in on the eye shadows of course that is what you guys all want to see here now there are 21 shades of course they all have the names under them they range from pure mattes to shimmers - I guess full metallics I'm not really sure I do want to mention that it came with this little book which i think is like how to get looks or it's a suggestion of what colors to use oh yeah definitely there is Hollywood Paris Milano and Miami okay so it's basically like an instruction manual it says prep under eye with eye cream prime your lid obviously I'm going to make my own look and I would try to use as many shades as possible all right let's dive into the bare palette all right now we're going to plan the lids with of course my favorite Mac painterly Paint Pot and if you have your favorite eye primer go ahead and use that of course lids are primed I'm going to go in with the top shade here called a door actually use the Bayer brush and see what happens okay now there is not that much kickback on the fallout did not rain down the palette let's see it is actually any pigment I am like so curious like I was going to do finger swatches before I even applied it to my lid and I'm like what the for girl no this is a very light beige crease color so let's just place her right in there that blended very quickly so first impressions on the very first matte that I've ever touched or any shadow it blend really easy it's one of those formulas that reminds me of if any of you guys watched the storybook cosmetics Harry Potter I shadow palette review I did that a few months ago formula reminds me of that where it's not really chalky or powdery it's almost like it's in the pan but then you hit the brush there's great payoff and that doesn't cause a mess and I really like how it just really blended it easy so let's go in with shade fantasy right below a door it is a like cranberry red color and just hitting the pan there's not a lot of fallout which is great let's see how it goes on the eye [Music] I'm just going to take this with no other color real quickly and just kind of blend that into each other so they become best friends that color did blend out good so I think the mats are probably pretty good I want to put something metallic or shimmery on my lid so maybe this one up here it's like a kind of weird orange let me let this  take it there you guys this one is called pennies from heaven oh wow the brush is very coated she may have some pigment now of course I love using metallic shadows wet but we are going to try a drive first and see affinity pigment this is so subtle I'm literally just going to take this on my finger really quickly and just do what happened here okay so you guys see my finger is covered we're just going to go right in now we're getting a little sunset vibe here I don't mind that at all so going into my finger applied the metallic pigment way easier than the brush obviously I'm sure if the brush was wet it would apply way easier but we will see you momentarily so I'm going to wet the brush with some setting spray from morphe and now we're going to go in with wet on this side and let's see what happens this brush is not living for me let's go in with a different brush you guys I'm not feeling this one I'm like I swear this shadow is going to work for me hey maybe it doesn't let's try it out alright so this is a really wet on the garage let's go in now maybe it's just a color I'm not really living for it it's definitely not as metallic as I personally would want so I wasn't obsessed with that metallic shade but it's cute it blended nice so at least it did what it's supposed to do I just thought it's going to be a little bit more metallic so I'm going to do a little bit of a little inner corner here we're going to go in with shade angel wings right here and I'm going to take this tiny little morphe detailing brush and we're going to see how it looks that shade was really cute I also just kind of drag it down a little bit under my eye I love it it's a little bit more brighter than this one on the lid so I'm happy so far I think it's time to go in with Prairie flower right here just because I'm so curious on if they made this a good formula or not let's do a little pencil brush here and let's go you guys this is not bad now usually these colors are like really likes tricky or chalky or they don't really have a lot of pigment right away but this one is good so far this is looking nice I'm actually going to use the Bayer brush and go in to that color and just kind of give it a little more like a smoky drama effect I'm dying to try this black matte shade called magic I'm just going to put a tiny little bit of black in the crease here and I'm going to be very light handed here because I don't know how pigmented this black is so I'm just tucking the color magic right in here now I'm just going to tuck it and stop it right there all right you guys I think I've used plenty of shade I'm just for this look I wish I could use 20 more colors but I haven't gotten no damn room so so far so good I was pleasantly surprised with the formula with this definitely was not expecting everything to blend as nice as it did and I kind of liked this look um okay I am going to quickly put on some mascara and lashes to finish this off so I think it's only fitting that this is surprising that we go in with the benefit roller lash mascara this damn wand is so good it just literally just grabs the hairs and makes them like BAM if you are someone that is really not into false lashes I think that this mascara is perfect for you because you literally don't need me and sometimes I get a little insecure where I feel weird without beautiful lashes and then I put this on and I'm like oh I'm fine [Music] so mascara is done now I was going to do false lashes but I really don't think I need it and I kind of want to show off this eye look if you will so mascara is done now I think it's time to move on to the cheeks now let's take out our bare highlighting brush and let's take out the bear duo highlighter the shades are called uptown and downtown now the thinker's watch earlier was a little underwhelming but we did not try it on our face yet so let's get into it and let's see what happened oh okay it ain't that bad y'all I'm going to do a second layer and I'm going to take it all the way back to the hairline nothing new here this is Q you guys I am not mad at it let's do the other side and then maybe just for fun I'll take the other color which looks to me a little more darker on the brush so maybe if you are more on the medium to dark skin tone it will pop more on you oh I see kind of it right here it's a little little duo pink type of moment it ain't bad alright now I think it's only fair that we do a little bit on our Cupid's bow let's mix them both after a little bit on a nose and then we'll just do a lid on the chin so first impressions on this highlighter definitely was not expecting it to look this pretty on the skin I think that finger swatch earlier I was like oh girl I definitely thought that that was going to be one of the misses of the collection but shockingly enough I'm surprised all right now let's move into the glosses now of course you know I got one right in the barrel here so I'm going to pull out my Emme and I don't know what kind of formula this is there's really no info on the website yet so we are just going to go in it could be sheer it could be fully opaque I don't what the hell I'm getting myself into but there is the Virgen wand untouched now let's see this is a fragrance none really it's kind of smells a little like you know makeup II like it smells like makeup but there's no like cake smell or anything wild all right well let's see what she looks like [Music] alright I'm a little shook at how pigmented and beautiful this glosses i am like stealing my Barbie fantasy right now only thing was little I call these minis of course that I did have to dunk in a few more times and maybe with like a bigger wand but the dough fit was not bad you see it's like that flat tip thing so I did have to go in a few times to get it fully opaque but it did an amazing job and nothing's on my teeth I love it yeah I mean not everyone is into like full pigmented Colossus I know that but if you are girl this one is stunning now I think it's only fair that I quickly swatch the other four on my hand just so we can kind of see what the colors look like so of course there are four more BAM and let's just swatch them all now so we have Paris pink Hollywood Malibu and so hold it let's see what you look like here is Malibu it is a gorgeous light nude color here is Soho it looks to be well let's see oh my god okay pigment damn now this does have a little bit of glitter through it which looks really pretty close-ups almost like a metallic wow that one is stunning and definitely has full coverage here is Hollywood of course that is done name all right here is all five sludge I am pleasantly shocked and surprised by the mosquitoes Sephora collection overall I do want to give you my box real quickly so let's just start from the top obviously I'm wearing this damn look lost chains I love it I think obviously if you are into this collection you are into designer stuff or really really cute packaging either way you of course are going to get something really unique and special now the cool thing about Sephora teaming up with this brand is that they've made it affordable it's not astronomical when I saw the price points I was like damn I'm not mad at it usually you guys know what I say about luxury stuff you are paying for the name whether it's Gucci or D or or YSL but with this one it's kind of cool that they tame it with Sephora because you're not getting gouged by like a $60 highlighter so let's sound off the lipgloss chain I'm obsessed to it it's heavy its luxurious and I love the glosses right here I would definitely wear this and put this in here this amazing the highlighter pleasantly surprised on the skin I think it's really beautiful and if you're someone that is not obsessed with the metallic glow I think this is a good medium and it was creamy it was buttering and come on the bear compact disease let's move on to the brushes now I only use 3 out of 5 of course I will use the other two in the future just because they're so damn cute they do feel soft they feel nice of course they're heavy I love heavy packaging so overall I am obsessed with the quality of these now of course we have the eye mask of course of an eye mask how do you really review this you put it over your head on a flight and you see if any light gets in and hopefully not so I will bring this on my trip this weekend and of course the final thoughts on the bear eye shadow palette it's different our approach yes the mosquito Sephora collection is Jeffrey star approved and I'm a little shocked like you know me I'm all down for not working because I don't think that everything is always going to be great but this collection overall is consistently amazing I'm like now this palette of course is it practical for it everyday use yeah you hope you put it on your nightstand and you open it I love the packaging I think this is so unique obviously I know some people are going to be shady about it at the end of the day it is a very unique adorable amazing and very different and I love a brand that steps it up and just takes it they're definitely inspiring but has my brain cooking for some future stuff if you want to snag a few of these items from the collection when it goes live I suggest you run and get it because I feel like this is going to be something that will be gone very quickly so thank you guys so much for watching first impressions and I will see you on the next one mwah bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel hi how the hell are you doing alright today we're gonna dive into a brand new eyeshadow palette I gotta show it off right away so first of all today was not planned I was gonna film something totally different I was about to mix 25 foundations primers and concealers and up my whole face do we still want to see that video let me know but besides that I was sitting down to film and Nate pops into my filming room and he goes baby I found something that you need to review that you don't know about and I was like what your dick and he goes BAM and he hands me this palette and I was like Nickelodeon first of all I am a 90s baby I grew up literally watching Rugrats every morning before school I was addicted to cartoons I loved Nickelodeon like this is such a nostalgic moment for me I'm staring at this like holy so when Nate handed me this I was like okay mr. reviewer you found something that I have never heard of I didn't even know this existed so today we're going to be reviewing the Nickelodeon 90s nostalgic eyeshadow palette I made that up it's just called the Nickelodeon palette I want to see what the Realty is so if you guys want to see if the Nickelodeon eyeshadow palette is Jeffrey star approved then keep on watching so this palette it's pretty big actually for what it is I'm not mad at it at all this comes with ten eyeshadows now this does say that it is made in China so it's either gonna be really great or really bad now this palette retails for sixteen dollars and ninety cents that is such a random number each pan has it says two grams / 0.07 ounces per unit oh maybe that's like the tire that's the entire thing so it says directions external use only keep out of reach from children okay girl now the ingredients are very minimal it's like talcum mica mineral oil and a few things that you create to make eye shadow to me there has to be more ingredients it feels a little weird having literally 1 2 3 4 5 6 ingredients to create all this  the palette does come saran wrap only right here which I find very weird but it lets you open it and see inside so it does come protected I mean I guess it does make sense but the fact that other people can just open it it's kind of weird for sanitary reasons but hey so what do you open it you see all the cartoons we got Ren and Stimpy we got Rugrats there's just so many iconic moments like I oh my god this is so cool it looks to me oh my god that is so cute all of the shade names represent parts of different shows which i think is really cute it also comes with this brush girl that brush looks sodium cheap I am done but let's open it we don't wanna be too judgmental now first of all I think that the packaging is amazing I love the orange I love all the cartoons besides that I think it's time to open this up how do we do that let's just that easy Oh wallah of course we saw this is protecting it BAM oh and it has another protector which I do like okay I'm not mad at that okay so we do have two protectors now the brush you guys well or jesus take the wheel I wish you can reach them to the screen right now and feel this okay look at this brush you guys oh okay sorry that this brush feels so cheap it's almost like it didn't need a brush or if you're gonna make one make a better synthetic this literally feels worse than like a child's paint brush it like Ojai hurts like girl that we're gonna use this brush for one color just to see I have to see why they even included this okay moving on from that we got to see if the shadows are pigmented do they blend are they amazing let's find out alright now I will say this the pen size is massive I'm gonna take out this little mac eye shadow I have bitch they come in from me they got like beauty killer size pans up in here so I love the shape of the pan it's very cartoon and very Nickelodeon so cute I don't Ram bling we're gonna dive into this palette and I think the first shade that we're gonna do right here it's called Oh fish sticks now I think it's fair to lay down some primer I do that with every video obviously so we're gonna go in with the Mac painterly primer of course one of my go-to s and we're just gonna take a little she's getting low we're just gonna take a little Mac synthetic brush and apply some primer right to the lid right there because baby we need to prime our lives alright now that we're primed we're gonna take the same brush and dip in here - oh fish sticks let's see a little 1 2 3 oh my god bitch there's zero follow you better work loading in okay Wow I'm gonna go shook alright let's put this on the lid and see if we have any pigment so I guess let's see what happens oh okay [Music] alright that actually worked I had no idea what to expect you guys I'm like what the hell first of all this shade actually works amazing alright so looking on the back of this it says that Viacom of course who owns Nickelodeon did license is out but it says that tastes beauty LLC which is a New York company now I googled them and they do a lot of manufacturing for random stuffs there was like ice cream companies and all this stuff so this company does put out a lot of beauty random products for other companies so who knows if the rest of the shades are gonna be poppin but so far this one is not bad so let me just finish this on this side and let's see if the other colors work now we're gonna take a little Gucci eyeshadow blending brush and we are going to dip into shade hi ho diggity it is this macaroni and cheese orange right here and let's see oh that one has a lot more fall out not bad but look at the brush baby it is coated I just want like dipping again and have to stop okay now let's see how this is gonna look we're just gonna pop this right into our crease let's be really dramatic here we have no eyebrows we're just trying to live we're just trying to survive on this planet oh my god pigment what the hell okay orange I am not mad at this at all now it's blending nicely with that kind of like topi white shade oh fish sticks so I'm just gonna be really dramatic and take this all the way in and just leave space on my lid for something else maybe we'll buff in some of that pink I love a pink and orange moment so the only thing I'm seeing is as I'm blending out it's not like sticking fully if you guys can see what I'm seeing like it's not bad it's just kind of getting a little blending some more and see what happens not too bad I'm sure I see if the shadows are mixing well together I am gonna take this we're barely dip into that and we're just gonna go right over that orange let's soften her all right we're looking range we are definitely fully orange okay you guys the only thing I'm noticing is that when you're blending these out they're a little low quality in the sense that like that's gonna be a little tricky because my lighting is crazy but you still this is really dark here and when you try to blend up it doesn't blend the best but it's not that video cuz I'm blending my life away and I'm making it work it's just a little more difficult than normal but hey it's not bad okay moving on now I was thinking of dipping into coffees just so many options I mean look we have full orange you guys it's like pink sand and probably this one let's try this one this is called all dolled up the very pink so let's see if that one wants to work and maybe I'm just gonna pack that on my whole lid maybe know that maybe let's just put it right in there I wasn't sure what kind of formula this is it appears to be like a metallic but I guess we shall see all right so let's just a little off it'll most of it came off now let's just place that right in here and let's see what happens is it April Fool's because where the hell is the pig man the orange one was like holy  this one okay y'all see what I'm saying hmm okay and look at the mess this pink one made just for the record girl I'm blowing on my palate I'm gonna try thy finger literally which I hardly ever do but with world Shadows I've been doing that more and more now that I have short nails it's a lot easier okay this is almost bunching up on my finger but let's just press it near my lid and let's see what happens [Music] okay so although the is flopping not living for that shimmer shade at all I'm kind of offended like it's a pink shadow I was like this is the one let's pop it over here to make it even okay this brush is working slightly better but not really okay we are going in with our finger one more time right in your guys like it looks cute for a second and that evaporates like did Houdini make this palette and they didn't label him as the creative director all right I got a dip into another shimmer shade the shade is called I'm beautiful and I swear to God if there's no pigment first of all I'm no highlighter on I feel naked I feel ugly I feel disgusting okay for real though let's try our drivers of the highlighter does that pink one was so offensive my brain can't compete what's happening okay we're gonna go in with this little anasazi a highlighting brush and let's go in with I'm nude okay I mean I'm not mad at this as a highlighter baby oh she looks cute Nickelodeon you better get that glow all right so I'm finessing this into the skin it looks a little chalky in person but not that bad like I would probably wear this over the fallout on this one my whole nose is like a disco ball Jesus well we're getting through it I think the highlights kind of pretty it's like streaking out like didn't stick to my face that is so weird so I think we should dive into another matte shade I want to try this one you idiot right here with that's cute sorry I need to fall out y'all alright let's grab a little brush right here and we're gonna dive into the dark burgundy you idiot so we're gonna take this color and put it in the crease where that pink should have stayed and it let me down [Music] um okay I mean the matte shades cute not tested on animals I was seeing if this formula is vegan it might be there's no carmine or anything to make the red shades like work better but there's also no red dyes some confused of how they made this color but regardless it's working a little bit better than that pink one because oh my god that mm-hmm all right you guys oh it looks pretty from far away but once you get closer its oh it's a little messy okay let's keep moving on in trying a few more shades I think I want to try to put in some sort of color right in there I mean I would probably keep it really light and white but we do need to try out some more shades now this blue one is speaking in my name but blue and orange we all know I'm scared the test is purple you guys I gotta be honest I'm so scared of these shimmer shades like I got a touch one let's try it okay that looks pretty there but maybe it's cuz of my finger sometimes you guys when you swatch things with your fingers they can look great and on the lid they look awful or vice versa like I'm not that mad about it but it just feels a little thin like sheer I guess like it kind of looks opaque and then when it settles it's like yeah I just want to try this stunning green one it's called a rawr and it looks actually have glitter in it where the other ones don't this one is beaut if we zoom in here you can actually see the glitter so I'm gonna take this clean finger right here let's go right here oh okay let's try this I'm not doing this you guys we're gonna zoom in right here on this finger this is what's going on right now now I know trust me even some of my shadows when you swatch them with your finger they can look a little weird because it really meant for brush isn't on your lid I get that so I'm gonna try this but I was very show and how that looked I'm like oh all righty so we're gonna take a little Tom Ford blending brush and let's first of all try this because maybe this needs a brush so let's go in let's see what this looks like on okay let's try that again I'm digging in this pan right here you guys digging okay let's try it again hmm my powder brush really blended that out okay we're gonna scratch another shade first of all since I'm just on a roll we got to try out this stunning brush that came with the palette I think we should use a matte shade or maybe only we're kind of running out of matte shades besides this blue one you guys that's it we've used this one this one and that one and the rest of them are all shimmers which I'm a little shocked at the shimmers I gotta be honest okay that's going with this one this is called we loves me okay and let's go in with that oh the brush maybe holds a little bit of pigment okay girl let's see what happens I mean just with the brush it actually shows up better than that green one I'm kind of shocked let's go in with the finger okay we're gonna go in right there okay I mean this review is a little shocking we're gonna go in a little bit more with the finger on the lid huh did that invisible bitch from Fantastic Four create this alright you guys I think I'm ready to give my final thoughts but I am dying to try this blue and I feel like if I don't try it you guys might hurt me so let's go in here there's this shimmer has rained down everything it's like girl oh okay so the blue looks to be like we might have some pigment here of course there's a little bit of kickback but not like anything crazy now I'm gonna take this blue and I'm gonna put it under what's through this side cuz that green is just offensive and let's just see what happens okay I mean something I mean at least there's pigment on this one right alright we're just gonna put this blue right over that green I'm having a rough time and I normally don't say that and lest the cameras off and I'm in bed but man this is just oh I was gonna do lashes I was gonna do a liner I was gonna do mascara now I just want to go home and cry so I thought you guys let's give our final thoughts okay I didn't expect this I did not expect this outcome alright let's just break it down the nickelodeon eyeshadow palette i had high hopes baby for $16.90 i said girl this formula is gonna work it's gonna be sickening it probably should have been like ten dollars or eight dollars now the packaging is literally ten out of ten like bit killed it looks like a cassette it's cool there is cartoons everywhere at the orange background of the pallet below um behind the shadows is amazing everything is really cool aesthetically wooden eight gave me this I was like oh my god gagging living breathing deceased cremated quaking shaking you know the drill but after playing with this I realized that they maybe should have done an all matte palette the matte shades for the most part we're great obviously the blue the blue looks cute on camera I'm looking in the monitor but overall it's not like rich in pigment like to me it still looks a little like Airy or faded or if you were to touch it Oh actually doesn't really come off it's kind of shocking I'm like let me try to rub it away barely it's just not like rich it's just not as pigmented as I would have loved now the shimmer shades metallic shimmer frost whatever they're calling it they're a flop they're not good at all the fallout was extreme I think this is kind of cute for a highlight but it just went everywhere it's like all over my lap all over my face whoo it was rough this pink one get it I'm offended Pink's my favorite color I'm offended the orange and that one were probably my favorites the orange is actually really cute the more that the orange is on I don't mind it at all I think that you idiot was really cute the dark kind of wine color but everything else oh I just can not so I pause the video and I said where did Nate buy this and he goes oh I bought at Hot Topic at the mall in Topanga and I was like baby Hot Topic is selling this I know the Hot Topic has a make up it is very lackluster but I had high hopes for this I thought maybe Hot Topic would find any lab or something and mmm I'm highly disappointed I'm such a 90s I mean I am a 90's kid I love the collodion so much but I'm speechless - guys I'm like trying to find something nice to say it I just can't when you guys saw the shadows perform it was bad so I do have to say that the Nickelodeon eyeshadow palette is not jeffree star approved like literally a Maybelline palette or an elf eyeshadow palette from the drugstore had better pigmentation and payoff than this I think the mats were great like I said but there's only four mats and I'm like I can't even count I'm so shook there's seven out of ten shimmers so I think that should have went the other way and whoever made this and if you're watching this please work on the metallic formula cos girl I can't believe you even approved that to put this in here but alright you guys actually a lot of fun trying this I love just staring at this I think it looks so cute is it worth $16.90 no it ain't well over that price point I can't I'm done all right you guys I'm sad I'm actually sad I'm really upset that doesn't work this one's going in the drawer oh my voice just cracked I'm upset alright you guys thank you for watching today's review I gotta put my hood on I'm sad I don't like it alright well I'm gonna go uh smoke away my sorrows and I will see you on the next video bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today oh girl today okay today today we are trying out the crazy brow stamp that I've seen a lot of youtubers and beauty gurus review over the last few months but here's the catch all of them had brown hair and this bitch has zero brow hair so I think I am now if I'm wrong I'm wrong I have not researched this but from all the reviews that I've seen I am the first person without any brow hair to try out the infamous brows stamp now of course there are several brands that make these and I saw my on Amazon it is from a brand called kiss and it's called I envy and it looks something like this and I got it from Amazon for $11.85 y85 girl why not just a flat 12 okay but um this came on Amazon Prime and I got it in one day and here's a funny thing is this has been sitting in my house for like three months probably so many products keep coming out I really like it can't keep up and it's like oh my god so I'm finally getting around to trying this and so many people I've used it lately on my girl is time so if you want to see me try this crazy raps damn and keep on watching alright so this comes in a crazy plastic thing that these nails are not going to open so let's get some scissors and cut into this thing girl oh okay so oh my god I did not see that when I got like I didn't see this to the packaging but it comes with a right and a left brow camp and it looks something like this so obviously you do not get to choose the shape of your brow this is the shape that the company is chosen for install wow I mean that's not a bad shape for my eye I'm not gonna lie let's see if it works oh right let's read the instructions that is butchered alright simply stamp your favorite eyebrows evenly no mess no fail quick and easy brow application whether you have a light brows or have lost to brows due to over tweezing or alopecia the eyebrow stamp pre-shaped left and right will create the perfect natural looking eyebrow a few seconds that will last all day all right so it says be sure that your skin above your eye is dry and clean of course I have foundation on a little bit of highlighter but my skin is clean it says pat on the pressed powder with the stamp you just got a position it stamp it on against the skin and press touch up if needed it says on the little picture here okay so this does come with two graphs dance they pop out like this so of course you can put them back easy which i think is kind of cool and of course the brows look like this oh my god you guys this is going to be interesting I've never even tried a brow stamp before you know I've shaved my eyebrows off in tenth grade and I always get asked like do you use brow stencils or I honestly just freehand them on every single day of course recently and you know several years ago I did no brows for like a year I'm kind of getting into the fun phase of using highlighters for brows and other stuff like that but I always freehand them on so this is going to be interesting now the powder is in this thing it just says browse stamps in shade dark brown it was the only shade that I saw on Amazon yeah it says that it is made in Korea interesting okay and it says the company is from Port Washington New York and that's it I think we should get started you guys I was expecting on Mir right here not gonna lie I was definitely expecting a mirror I'm like okay you can use this in this BAM nope no mirror I'm interested to see if this is like a powder or a cream type of thing it says it's like a powder so I'm just gonna take my finger you guys and just touch the outside oh it almost feels like oh come on pigment and it was feels like I'm not wet powder but like a you know almost like this was a little cooling or like not powder obviously you guys see no fallout and okay I mean it actually stuck to my finger because it's supposed to be permanent right I mean okay I mean not in a bad way but like oh this is gonna work okay let me wipe it this off of my body and we're gonna get started alright so I have the right brow in my hand so I'm going to take the brow and of course it's clean I am going to press it down firmly now you see how squishy let's get the product all over it oh wow so you kind of have to like drag it around for a second oh now we've got some fallout girl all right so the applicator is completely covered now see that totally opaque here is what it looked like before the powder make sure it is completely coated and don't play games I'm just going to take a large mirror over here and oh my god I'm like nervous I'm like fuck okay I'm like put this mirror back a little bit you guys act like guess like where this is going this is like scary territory like do we want it high do we want it low I think that's probably a good length so let me line it up with my tear duct and oh my god I just did it way too high you guys well the end has some powder fallout so that is why it looks like this on the end Lord okay let me wipe off this excess powder before it stains my skin that's a high brow that is a high mother effing brow I'm never going to this is in one more time on here it says that you can touch it up I'm scared to like put this on one more time but I'm gonna try to match it up perfectly oh my god sorry guys if I'm blocking its scaring okay it's a little darker I mean that is a high brow you'd have to get like 10 faceless up to God to even get this - pro okay we gotta try the other side I'm still gagging over ow hi put that brow hey fuck it right okay so that wasn't me right brow no we're going to do a left brow which you can see is blank with no product and let's go in again maybe I won't stamp is hard because I have a wrinkle residue at the end I'm like fuck me let's aim a little lower this time minke I'm gonna have to really fucked up brows okay here we go oh my god oh my god well I definitely had some commas why does this one look like almost a different shape but they're not they're like identical but um I hate the shape with his brows I'm gonna admit it I fucking hate the shape I am NOT down for this natural look this is not natural hmm this is not natural at all I'm gonna try right near that one and just see what happens the shape is horrifying you guys I just want to put that out there in case you're at home watching and you didn't know I'm not down for the shape I think we should also get to the real real review of talking about the product I think that the powder is I mean it says it's designed for people with also no hair so I expected the powder to be a little bit more opaque it says touch-up it's needed I would literally have to go and with like a brush let's just use a pencil brush here and I would have to like paint on more coverage right which is not looking that great when I even did that I'm like oh girl this is rough I mean the means and the screenshots that I am about to receive right now I'm scared okay let's just see what happens if we do one more now my real brow probably would have been like that oh my god why does the arch do that and the plastic you guys just went in my skin right here with powder I'm not down I am NOT into this I honestly think that if you already have a brow this could help you quickly like do a fill-in but if you were someone like me I don't know about this I don't fucking know let's do the side just for a laugh where I've already fucked up my makeup this far in oh where was the coverage on this we're fucking powder just like really go in and like get the beat up this compact ah alright I'm gonna go take a hit and I'll be right back alright you guys now thank you so much for watching my Halloween tutorial and how to be a cat if this is not the final look I don't know what is I'm ready for the runway Shante you stay honey what's going on right now my life and the broad stamp is not Jeffries our brew I hate it I think the formula the powder is weird it's bizarre it is not fully opaque it's very weird and long-lasting and just came off my fucking cheeks girl that kind of almost look like a tarantula like spider legs you're like it's like a spider sat on my face - spiders house Aegina I'm not the Google that later hope you've enjoyed me degrading myself for everyone yay and I'm not down I really do not prank this product I definitely think and I'm going to sound like a broken record if you already have brow hair this could be a quick easy moment for you if you're someone that hates filling in your brows you could easily like stamp this over for me it's not it this is not the one the double brow effects though is almost like an optical illusion like I'm are you guys watching me in 3d whoo okay you're not and you know that alright I'm babbling this is time to end alright you guys aw see you on the next video mwah 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel good morning today we are gonna get full motherfucking coverage with a new foundation that just hit the market and girl when I tell you that my twitter feed has been going off the hook to review this I'm like okay girl we are here we're gonna sit down and I've been traveling a lot I'm sure if you follow me on snapchat which if you don't awkward but if you do you know that I was just in Helsinki Finland and I was expanding jeffree star cosmetics into crazy parts of Europe that I've never been to before and it was in saying of course we filmed some footage so we'll be doing a vlog later but I'm back and girl at the jet lag is hitting me it's ten hours ahead in Europe's on my brain it's just like I don't know what's happening but now that I'm home it's time to get back to filming I know it's been about a week and everyone is like so hi alright so today we're gonna jump right into it we are going to talk about the new Hoodie Beauty faux filter foundation now this has been all over my feet to review and I've seen all over Instagram I've seen a lot of people say it is like very airbrush quality which you all know I want to look like a fucking plastic doll at all times so hopefully this gives us the coverage that we need so in this video today we are going to test it out I'm gonna do of course a full wear test with this we are going to do one side of the face with a brush which will be this arty sky right here and then the other side of my face will be with a Beauty Blender this brand has also put out a brush that goes at the foundation and a primer and there are so many reviews on the all three already so I'm like you know a girl if I were to buy a new foundation anyway I wouldn't buy the primer that it comes with necessarily or the brush because we all have our own tools at home and we all have our own way of getting ready so I feel like girl if you're gonna spend money on a foundation you don't need the brush and you shouldn't need the primer and I see a lot of people get discouraged because they see and I'm not talking about this brand I just mean overall they see people come out with all these different products and they combine them together and they're like but the primer didn't really work well with the foundation well it depends on your skin type of course so today I'm gonna be using my own primer that I have been using a lot and these brushes instead of the hood of beauty ones today we are just going to be testing out the foundation so if you want to see what the hell happens then keep on watching so this foundation retails for $40 and when you open it up inside you get this gorgeous little bottle I love the ombre on the bottle with the black I love the square component it kind of reminds me of a Tom Ford Foundation I have but even more cute now of course this is plastic it is not glass which is pretty good for travel I know a lot of people don't like traveling with glass bottles because they can break and who wants a broken foundation bottle in their makeup kit Lord been there done that hated it when you open it up of course it has a pump so it is all sealed in there and is really not gonna spill which I really love now the shade range is really cool because there is over 30 shades for this brand but Rihanna's been tied at 40 I know and she's fucking everything for doing that I know that creating a foundation which I know a lot of you're gonna be like where is the Geoffrey Foundation it's coming I promise when you hop on Sephora calm it says that this is of course in a Sephora exclusive besides the crazy shade range this is going to give you a full or a medium coverage look so if you like sheer foundation I don't even know why the hell you're watching this girl this is for normal dry combination oily so they're basically saying it's for everyone now what else do we need to know about this foundation I mean girl its foundation right so a lot of your like let's go let's go it says use a dime size amount or less that's gonna cover my whole face oh my god apply to skin using circular or dabbing motions okay it says although it dries to a radiant powder finish if you have oily skin setting it with a thin layer of translucent powder gives you a more incredible flawless all-day matte look alright alright so we're just gonna apply this you guys like let's keep it real like we're gonna yeah that's mean that's it I'm looking at the instructions its foundation y'all we know how to put the damn foundation on all right deep breath engines are ready to roll umm I have so many primers I know I've been using this one all year the Sisley one is bomb oh I keep I also keep you using that far Sally unicorn essence this one is really good very good like sticky like the foundation sticks on so let's just go on with this one like I said there was 30 shades released so I bought a few online you know how it is how do you shave match yourself Sephora will suggest things but you never know I got three shades here I got custard vanilla and angel food so all the names are listed of course or right at the top now I did swatch them already just on the side of my face so I didn't have to do that on camera and have to wipe it off and redo the primer the whole thing so last night I just want like that I didn't blend it out or try it yet because I hate trying things unless it's on camera and now I'm gonna do custard and mix in a drop of vanilla so of course this says use like one pump and it's supposed to cover everything I don't know about all that so let's try the artiste brush first this will be on this side of the face BAM my right and this will be on my left let's see what this looks like BAM yes allegedly that's supposed to be a lot to me I need like three more pumps but I think maybe cuz I'm gonna do two sides of the face I should do more pumps now let me do a tiny drop of this just to get a little bit in there BAM you guys see that literally a drop of vanilla in there and then we're gonna take the end of a brush we're just gonna mix it right there and put that right on there like you know every foundation kinda has a fragrance or like a scent this one is like really strong it reminds me of like old like old lady perfume or like oh my god like you know any smell of perfume and you know okay whatever we got to get to blending is there on how fast this dries but anyway I'm gonna take a drop of that right you see right there and we're just going to blend and let's see what happens [Music] [Music] and we will do of course half of the neck and a little bit on the chest area all right guys let's see it before and after now obviously it is a little darker than my normal skin tone which is what I wanted I do like a little bit of tan to my foundation now of course this was applied what the artiste brush so as you can see we're just gonna do a little split here is my normal skin and then here is the flow filter foundation on it okay so so far I really love the coverage obviously you know I'm a full coverage bitch love how it's looking first impressions it looks nice it's not looking cakey only thing is like even though this is like it's I guess dry now I still smell a foundation it's like it's lingering which not the end of the world I don't really mind smells all the time but it's a little strong now I heard a lot of people say you don't have to like set the foundation with powder which girl if you're gonna do a full mask anyway you're gonna set your foundation with powder so a lot of people are like hey test it when it's dry and feel it and yes it does feel a little tacky and sticky which I don't know if that's a bad thing because other brands I have had that happen before and I'm about to put powder on anyway so let's do another pump on my hand and let's try the Beauty Blender it's crazy because when I first read like one pump I was like come on girl but one pump you guys this is fit one more time hmm come on discoloration work all right so now we're gonna take the Beauty Blender which has no product on it yet we're about to hit it right there and I like to dot of course all over the skin and let's blend and see what happens all right this site is blended to perfection and let's zoom in and see which side we like more we have the beauty blender on this side and then of course the artiste brush on this side looking at the skin usually see like a difference but they kind of applied the same which is not a bad thing I'm like looking at the monitor any difference in like huh not really the beauty blender made it apply I think yeah I was like about to say something but I'm like not really any different now went on really nice with the beauty blender so whether you have a dense brush or this sponge I think it looks very pretty it is definitely a full coverage foundation which I love and yeah one pump really covered well I didn't cover the entire face remember because I did use two tools but it definitely would have if I didn't wipe it off and do another one which is crazy so you are definitely getting a lot of product for forty dollars we're gonna do a wear test so we're gonna see how this looks throughout the rest of my day and I am going to get ready I'm gonna do my normal concealer routine powder contour everything and let's see how the foundation holds but with the Beauty Blender is it tacky yes it is a little bit I was like it's almost less over here but no not really it's the same okay you guys so overall I like it so far the smell is the only thing that's kind of bothering me it's not the end of the world I would love it if it went away so we will see of course it's only been five minutes so let me do some more steps so you guys can see let's just go in with some concealer and let's see what happens of course we're gonna go in with our shape tape concealer and let's see how this formula holds now sometimes I know a lot of people think that if a new foundation doesn't go with your favorite concealer that's a bad thing sometimes ingredients don't match they don't mix well together and they just are not gonna be friends so you do have to try different primers and concealers with your new foundation to see what's really gonna work with it so now I am going to blend out this with this and maybe this with this let's get to blending [Music] I don't know which one I like more you guys this one like really blend of that concealer out nice just one did too this one sorry I don't know why I just went over that it's like habit alright let's look at the concealer and see how it worked with the foe foundation foe filter excuse me oh my god this one definitely applied the concealer like thicker and it's brighter under my eye that is a tray okay well that's fine that's good to know huh that's tripping me out look at that one's like minus ones like next step we are of course going to set our under eyes with a little bit of lemare the powder now my trick that I love to do is take a smaller artiste brush which one is this the oval 7 and I like to just dip right in I love a wet Beauty Blender as well but this to pack into the skin if you really want to beat the face just press that right in the eye and right into the skin not in your eye unless you really want to have some pain but hey and then for this side I will take the Beautyblender since it is damp and that is going to melt right into the concealer and into the skin leaving it full lawless alright you guys so I'm going to go finish the rest of my face I'm gonna go film another video and then go out tonight to a concert and I'm gonna be vlogging the whole time and I'll do some check-in so you guys can see how it really looks later right now with the concealer and everything blended it's looking pretty good and I still smell the foundation a tiny bit which is not the end of the world but I know a lot of people out there have been trying to shade the smell so I'm like I got to see what this is about for myself and yeah don't really mind it but it's there just so everyone's aware alright you guys so I will do some check-ins and I will see you in a little bit hey you guys alright got a new vlog camera let's give this a whirl I am doing new check-ins in foundation reviews so we got the daylight in on my face it has been about hour and 45 minutes since I have applied of course I finished my makeup and I'm actually in the middle of another review and just for the record it is about a hundred degrees today in Calabasas California alright so back to the foundation review is take a little zoom in on my skin as you can see it is very matte very pretty only thing and who knows if it's the primer or the foundation combination but there are a few pores I noticed on my nose that didn't really fill in which is kind of rare for me but yes I do have pores I am a normal person hey baby all right so Nate is working on our fish tank right now we just got this bad bitch installed what is it 340 gallon saltwater yes Melo saltwater it's coming together amazing look at the shrimp in there it's so cool so I am doing a foundation review right now okay what do you think of my skin I mean it looks pretty bad I mean I'm I'm liking it looks very like it almost looks like it has like a glow almost is it the fishtank lights probably it's probably the fish let's step away from the fish tank is it skin like is it powdery is it really matte is it shiny what's your what's your opinion it's very matte to me it looks like like your regular foundation almost mmhmm yeah my normal routine yeah this is like a very full coverage foundation so I'm giving it a whirl any cons that you see I mean I can see a little bit of pores on your nose only in a certain section for some reason yeah I don't know why they didn't fill in huh that's what I literally just said outside to kind of odd but all right you guys I will check in in a little bit and I'll be back

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel all right guys today we're going to dive into you another liquid lip swatch a video yes another brand is come out with liquid lips and they are reformulated they're brand new the colors are actually pretty dope I'm really excited today because we're going to be testing out the new MAC Cosmetics retro liquid lip color now there is a million colors I know the caps are hard to see so we're just going to flip them upside down they have so many new colors that just came out so we got a fistful of newness right here in my hand and I'm really excited about this because let me just tell you why now I'm sure a lot of you were like Jeffrey Mac put out liquid lip colors last year these aren't new to meet our new because let me just keep it really real as usual I try to feel them last year the formula was not really consistent with the colors it's very like all over the place so I am happy to announce that I think they reformulated their liquid lips because they haven't put out any new shades in a while and they just dropped a bunch of new shit so I was like okay you know what I think I'm finally going to give Mac a chance of course you guys know I am a Mac whore I mean I used to work in Mac I always used some other stuff their staple I mean I don't know how many years I think we're talking on about 15 years now where I've been using the Mac Studio Fix foundation powder I just can't stop like it is everything and the formula really works for my skin so that's been like a tried-and-true for me so when I saw that they launched a bunch of new colors I was excited because I see some teals some really dark colors I mean hi this is crazy and crazy in a really good way because I love funky colors and have a lot of really beautiful nudes like he's really great on nude Mac is back on trend girl so I know a lot of people have had so many thoughts and hit or misses with its formula so allegedly did reformulate I don't want to quote Mac because obviously don't work for them and I don't know the realty but a lot of people had said that they have changed it and updated it so we are here to put them to the test so if you want to see me swatch the new Max retro matte liquid lips colors and keep on watching all right before we get the swatch thing I'm going to give you guys a little bit of info about this product now you all know I'm logging - mac cosmetics calm all right so this says for those who prefer a timeless glamour to an all-out flash the matte reigns supreme max introduces a twist on this classic texture with robustly saturate shades of retro matte liquid lip color whichever shade you choose all promises one thing a splash of color any liquid suede finish that is impossible to forget here's what really gets my interest because I want to know where product claims to do so then I can really see does it do that so this said that is long where it's supposed to last eight hours the color words evenly in smoothly eight hours again okay we have two eight hour claims here and then it says it provides a stay true color and non feathering and a non bleeding formula okay that's interesting so before I think that we're kind of streaky not that great so I feel like this better really do what it says whole group now it says usage on how to apply it it says apply directly onto your lips using applicator girls alright so I think it's time to dive into these swatches now one thing I do want to read on the bottom here is that I would get like you know how much product is in one of these this one says there's five milliliters which is a 0.17 fluid ounces that's pretty normal for a liquid lip so the first shade we're going to try is this grey type of dark grey Brown and this shade is called simply smoked I'm lying so when you take a fucking quick break wooo alright so first of all let's open this bad bitch up she's never been used before look at that virgin one baby don't play me and oh oh all right so the doe foot applicator is more of a not a triangle but it does have a point which is nice too of course draw on the lines for the lips now and has that classic vanilla II kind of plastic cake smell that Mac has had forever which I kind of laugh at reminds me of being in junior high hmm its pleasant alright let me just grab a mirror here and let's see what happens that went on pretty opaque now there's not that much color left on the applicator it gets a little yeah I'm going to do one more jump which reports is a very normal let's give our little twist all right I'd like to get fully opaque coverage I am going to go in for a third time just for that little outer corner because I did lose a little bit of the pigment once I went really in let's go in one more time okay let's let this dry for a second it's actually drying really quickly which I love because I hate a lipstick that takes forever to dry all right here is simply smoke all dry now I will say one thing the coverage was full it went on really nicely we smile there's no crazy lines yet obviously it's only on my mouth for a few minutes but and it's full coverage which is a lot better than when I first tried anything to a time interval but I just feel like a date again exam pleasantly surprised right now now one thing it just feels a little drawing but it's a liquid list it's obviously going to feel a little more driving than normal lipstick but it's not like if I could dessert in my mouth is like turning continents it just goes a little little dry but nothing like crazy very normal so let's try the next color and see what happens all right this next shade is called a young attitude and I was actually really excited to try it because in this bottle it looks to be like a dark teal I don't know as a young attitude was the right shade for this usually what I think is young in attitude I think it's really pretty and soft in like Bay's or nudes but hey I'm on this brand so um let's see what this one looks like ooh wow it's like really dark green of course it smells the same and let's give this one a whirl all right I am dunking in a third time again and this one on the monitor it looks beautiful and it is flawless it's just a little gummy in here which I've just kind of had to finesse the wand over a few times which is not like a big you know deal-breaker for me a lot of brandy I do that with so let's finish this off all right this one is dry the color is beautiful I think I'm living for this one with this backdrop now only complaint is that maybe because the color is such a weird dark color there is a little bit of streakiness if we're going to zoom in right here real quick just a little bit I did put on a kind of like a second layer on top and it's kind of sometimes a new layer liquid lips I really don't like that they don't really settle together but overall it is a really beautiful color I just wish it wasn't so mm for some reason darker colors and I've noticed this with a lot of brands it starts to get a little weird so if you look here it's almost like flaking off like into my mouth so be careful if you are doing really dark colors like this I'm going to Pat my lip yeah just kind of it a little flakes on my finger nothing too major but I would probably wear this to like a photo shoot or somewhere world was not going to be out for a long time because I don't know how this would really last but I will try that out later this week all right let's get on to the next color all right now that it looks like I've been sucking off an alien let's move on to the next color now this did kind of stain my lips I did take a Beauty Blender with some foundation and Pat around my mouth still a little stain so we're going to power through it y'all know what it is all right so this next color is called burnt spice it is a beautiful kind of like a light toned nudie color with a little bit of mob in there a little bit of rose so let's put her on [Music] alright something I didn't notice first of all this color is beautiful I love nude lipsticks but this one was a little more opaque and what I mean by that is that I really only dumped in once and I did my entire mouth whereas the previous shades we just tried I have it going like three times so this one for whatever reason has more pigment than the other two shades which is a good thing that is a plus this one actually feels less drying than that first one where'd she go then this guy so this one is a less drying for whatever reason it's when it sells a little bit more like what's those nice and the cool thing about these your lips don't stick together thank God I don't know it has some crazy experiences in the past cool this one is it really pretty let's move on oh my god you guys are tripping me out because I put on that last color wiped it off even put a little bit of foundation over it and I still have this green rim around my mouth imagine if you would wear that for eight hours girl I don't know it but it did stain a little so be careful with that color because I'm like what in the yeah so this next color is a beautiful gray toned nude this one is called a flesh tone and it looks like it's just like a grayish nude which I love right up my alley so let's put her on [Music] all right I love this color it looks like a lot of lipstick that I already own because I love nudes I love the gray tone so this one is really pretty now same thing with the last color really one dumped covered my entire mouth so I don't know what is up with the news is there a little extra magic in here I don't what the hell was going on but it literally only took one dump with a wand and I got a full opaque coverage which I like which means on the bottle will not run out quick so same thing this you know has very consistent formula with the rest of them I really like this color alright let's move on alright guys with a few shades left now I'm going to try this gorgeous brown nude color is called so me vain bitch alright let's see what this bad bitch looks like [Music] girl I am loving this color these dark moods though I don't know why I'm just obsessed with them this color might be one of my favorites that I've tried on so far today and I really like this one I'm like girl work now all the news I mean just like I already said they went on beautifully amazing one swipe coverage is definitely the realty all right I have one more watch for you guys it's a really dark one so I'm excited and let's get to it all right guys this is the last one now this is a really dark shade it almost looks Brown from looking at it almost looks black but it's like a dark purpley pink now this one is called uniformly fabulous and let's see what happens all right I am pleasantly shocked you guys because so many brands I've had an issue with really dark colors for some reason out of its the formula mixing with the pigment it doesn't really translate a lot of times they kind of like chip off on your teeth or tongue even that green one was getting a little weird this one for some reason nothing's wrong it's really fully opaque I didn't have to go over at five times I get over and over and it looks really nice I'm like okay honey like work I really like it I'm like when I said pleasantly surprised I've just had so many bad experiences in the past with other brands usually it's really hard to pull off that dark dark color now it is not streaky it's just a little bit weird here which you're probably barely going to even see on camera I'm probably could take a lip brush and go over it very slightly but I'm really happy with this color Wow okay Mac I think it's time to give my final thoughts all right so my final thoughts on these I just went downstairs for a minute I drink a Red Bull I chilled out for a second amazing a few kids and this stayed on really great I'm like Emma like girl it's there I'm like okay I need um I was a little wary of this because you go home tonight a little bad experience last year but thank you Mac for him your formula for your liquid lips they're actually pretty great and all the colors went like went on amazing they were fully opaque they smelled nice the coverage was their only thing of course was that chillin stained a little bit high liquids obtained sometimes it happens it's not like it's Mac's fault every brand has a color that is stain my mouth before so that is not only a callin in my book I will say this definitely more strategy lips very well before applying I always like to do lip balm like 10 or 15 minutes prior to a liquid lip so it soaks in you never want to put on something right before because it is going to counteract with a formula it is not going to be long wearing and I still like a lot of people kind of forget that sometimes so these are Jeffrey's are approve gigantic and I don't really like them so thank you guys so much for watching this video and let me know your thoughts down below what was your favorite color do you think they're approved are they approved by you guys I definitely think that Mac stepped it up with these and I'm excited for them to release more colors so hopefully they do that throughout the year and I was a really pleasantly surprised how many times I gotta say that but for real I was a little shook shocked and shaken and I don't know what this dark look I feel like I'm about to go suck some blood or suck some insert here all right you guys thank you so much for watching another watchi video and I will see you on the next one mwah bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we are going to try out a crazy drugstore mascara that everyone keeps tweeting me sending me screenshots and I'm like I don't review that many mascaras on my channel but when there's a new hot drugstore item I want to tell you guys about it I want to kind of give you guys a quick little life update Before we jump into the review life has been really really crazy and just moving fast I'm like wait we're in July summers like here the years half over I'm shook next month is Nathan's birthday shout-out to all my Leo's out there Nate is August 19th anyone have the same birth is my ma'am Nate actually surprised me with roses and breakfast in bed today and a massage after I'm just in love you guys and I just can't get over it so I just want to share my happiness okay I think there's always so much drama going on in the beauty community I'm like let's just pause the breaks here talk about love and butterflies and condoms so besides that you guys if you are on the east coast on September 9th and 10th I will be there for RuPaul's Drag Con it is a huge convention celebrating the art of drag makeup and love my brand will be the main sponsor ll be selling my entire makeup collection there Elle has a booth I'm also bringing along Manny and Laura Lee so we're going to have a huge meet and greet and more details to follow so if you do want to buy tickets to drag Cohn everything will be linked down below oh I have something really exciting finally you guys I am bringing back some shades into my permanent line I'm also reintroducing some sold out shades that were part of a limited edition collection last holiday so drumroll please we got druglord liquid lipstick coming back of course if you want to wear white lipstick girl do you but a lot of people love using this for eyeliner my formula is vegan and eye safe and also it's really great to mix in with other liquid lips to manipulate them change them make them lighter so it's really a cool tool if you are a creative motherfuckers we have watermelon soda from last summer it's finally back and it still smells the same improve the formula on that and we got crocodile tears we also have designer blood which is one of my favorite shades so many people were like emailing customers service and we're like hey can you bring them back and then last but not least we have liquid lip shade deceased so those are all available on my website right now all right besides that you guys I'm ready to dive into this mascara so if you want to see if the motherfucking thing works and keep on watching all right so L'Oreal has put out a brand new mascara called the voluminous lash paradise first of all the packaging is pink had to match my backdrop today because you know I'm a pink whore I love the packaging already I think it's a really cute of course we're about to bust this baby open so this retails for $9.99 now I was researching drugstore mascaras in general and that it's pretty much a standard price point it's between like seven to twelve dollars and then once it goes up from there bitch any really drugstore so this packaging you guys says that this is Laurie Oates first mascara for a voluptuous volume and lush length basically the applicator is supposed to fulfill my lash desires so allegedly it has a soft wavy brush with over 200 bristles that is supposed to hold the maximum formula for a dramatic volumizing charge to catch every lash I feel like we're watching a movie preview this is so damn dramatic so provides silky volume in one coat okay so we're going to put that to the test right now intense at the gays soft to the touch so and then after it says it removes easily with soap and water so if any of you out there using soapy water to wash your face or your mascara off I'm coming for you okay so we are going to open up this bad boy out this is in shade blackest black I don't know if there's other colors this is the only one that I saw so let's open her up now everyone is saying that drugstore mascaras have really stepped it up and I've probably used a lot of them you guys know I am addicted to the benefit roller lash it is my tried-and-true cool I also want to note that this has 0.28 fluid ounces and unlike is that normal I don't even know it's a normal mascara this one says as 0.31 fluid ounces so that's close and then the benefit one has 0.30 so that is pretty standard so like every three to four months I threw away my mascara and I buy a new one for sanitary reasons you're always touching your eye and you know the mascara does get dry so the wand first impression let's see who okay so I'm just going to get the product off of there a lot of product did come out so it definitely is really adhered to the bristles I don't know if anyone else at home loves like the smell of makeup in general like I could smell the foundation for a minute I could hop some mascara and I'm not recommending that all right so of course I have a no mascara on my eyes right now now I do wear makeup you guys almost every single day so sometimes my lashes will have some residue but I did a deep cleaning and there should be literally nothing on them I'm also trying out a new concealer from benefit today and I will say this just fucking follow me you guys and now you're going to be like what the hell is it I mean let me grab it it is the benefit Boeing airbrush concealer alright so I'm going to of course do my top lashes first so here we go that's it one coat so I'm just going to do one coat of course I'll probably end up doing four or five but let's just try one and see what happen whoa okay hold on hold on the brush is big which I love but notice how it did hit my bottom lashes which obviously doesn't matter if I'm about to go in into the bottom but if you have really small eyes that may be a problem but so far so good so this is one coat you guys can see it's cute definitely think it needs one or two more just for my satisfaction so let's do another coat all right so the top one it looks pretty so far now let's go in with the bottom and I'm going to be careful because this brush is rather large so I'm just going to be really delicate oh wow that coated them like quick now I have no eyeliner on I have no I shadow really under here except barely a touch okay let's let this dry and then compare to the other side all right you guys so I do want to show you one side done so I'm going to look into the zoom and you guys can see this side of course is it's pretty good you guys like I'm a little shocked at how quick it was and then compared to the other side which is blank and naked you can see the volume do a little I turn first impressions I am really impressed this mascara I think that the bottom ones almost look like they're like false lashes I love how the bristles separated them really finely it didn't clump together it didn't get weird now my top lashes are definitely a little jacked up from putting on so many false lashes on for the last what 100 years over six months so they're not going to probably look as sickening as they will on any of you who don't wear false lashes every day but for my hair is being ripped out and pulled all the time it looks pretty damn good alright so I'm going to put this on my other eye and let's see how they look you know look altogether [Music] all right so looking in the maunder I love how it's looking I just love how it's very like bedroom eyes at the end of the day either a mascara works or doesn't it all depends on how you like it on yourself but my thoughts in my opinions I mean obviously I know this is a little shorter review than normal but this is a mascara and I was scared that it was gonna flop because I had not really like fall in love with the drugstore mascara and I will say this L'Oreal you do have it hit on your hands because this lash paradise is amazing I love how this looks my bottom lashes might be my favorite thing I just love I just like how it makes me feel I'm like I'm just a little sexy all of a sudden alright you guys I think we all know what the answer is going to be here the L'Oreal lash paradise mascara jeffree star approved I think for $9.99 you cannot be how great the wand works and I think the product is great it was quick drying it doesn't feel weird my lashes still feel like lightweight they don't feel crunchy or hard or you know y'all know what I mean sometimes mascara it looks like fucking low tranches and spiders and this just looks really nice I love how it looks if you guys want to let me know any hot new drugstore items that may not have heard of yet sound off in the comments section down below and let me know what items you want me to try next alright you guys thank you so much for watching today's video and I will see you on the next one bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I have no eyebrows and I'm pregnant but on a real level we are going to dive into something really exciting today the drugstore brand wet-and-wild has a brand new limited-edition collection and today I'm going to exclusively reveal the entire collection for you guys and we are going to do swatches we are going to do it a little demo we're going to go over all the prices now I just want to say a quick shout out to all of you guys because when I started my channel a year and six months ago I had no idea it would turn into this crazy like insane thing already so a quick shout out to everyone out there I just hit 5 million subscribers mmm wow so thanks to you guys for making it all possible it is unreal and also thanks to you guys for actually pushing me to try and use more drugstore brands I know I am a very intellectual but shockingly wet and wild over the last year has like shook me to the ground because they have come out with really great formulas we all know the highlighters that I have been promoting for month you guys have made them sold out in every drugstore across America and it's just really cool to discover brands that you guys have recommended like Jeffrey stop being so damn bougie and get into the drugstore and I'm really happy that I have been because some of the formulas girl that wet-and-wild foundation the photo focus like my wigs about to come off oh wait this is my real hair but you all know what I mean so today we are going to unveil the midnight mermaid collection of course it is for the fall and there's a lot of cool stuff in there it's kind of dark and glittery and dramatic so if you want to see me and dive into the crazy box and keep on watching now of course rewind to a few months ago wet and wild put out the first ever box from their line which was the unicorn collection and it did really really well for the brand I heard and I think it's really cool that this brand is doing like the whole entire collection for a discounted price I think it's kind of cool because so many people are like girl want the whole entire collection and if you don't that's all good but here is the midnight a mermaid collection of course it has this cute little mermaid on it the box has scales on the side has the moon with the ocean here's the little mermaid scales now of course unicorns and mermaids have taken over the beauty world I think unicorns are like girls we don't need any more unicorns in this world but mermaids are something that people are starting to kind of become really obsessed with as well and who wouldn't want to I mean come on let's flashback to my childhood Ariel was everything and so it's Ursula that pitchfork I still want it okay so let's open up this box and see what is in the collection whoo so as you guys see there is a lot in here we have a metallic liquid ice shadows we have metallic liquid liner everything is very metallic for the Fall and of course there is a brand new highlighter listen I am so excited to put this on my face today and there's a lot of stuff in here so I'm going to be doing a lot of hand swatches I'm going to be doing some of this stuff on my eyes we're going to do a little demo if you will and we're going to try out all four of the liquid lips on my mouth I do want to give you a some quick little tidbits about this collection it is launching August 13th and you can get everything individually on all PSICOM I love that wet-and-wild is now on also calm I'm praying that they'll be in store soon Ulta if you're watching this pay attention but I think it's cool if you want to use your also points or get some more you can buy the entire collection there also if you want the box and also you can buy the individual stuff on August 14th on wet and wild calm so if you want the bundle you got to go on their website besides that you guys we are going to dive into all of this so let's start playing also I want to announce something really exciting that I have teamed up with wet and wild and I am doing a giveaway of the entire collection so I actually have five of these boxes here at my house and we are going to pick five lucky winners to get the entire box so what do you got to do of course let's start number one you have to follow wet well beauty on Instagram their handle is right here so please follow them you got to be subscribed to my channel if you aren't already if you are why are you watching me and not subscribing girl get with it now I normally never say that but when it comes to giveaways you do got to be subscribed and besides that if you want to leave a comment down below say hi say what's up give me your thoughts on this collection but you do have to leave a comment and there's a way to track if you're following us so I think it's only fair that we do the highlighter first I'm feeling a little matte and a little bare and I don't like it so let's talk about this is the Wet n Wild mega glow highlighting a bar now you see the little mermaid on the front it is a really cute and now the name of this one ie midnight moon of course I was a little mermaid on the front which i think is so cute I do also want to know really quickly you guys that literally everything in this entire collection is vegan but one liquid lipstick so literally over 90 percent of the collection is the vegan and cruelty-free there's just one shade and I will mention it when i swatched them that is cruelty free but the formula is not vegan now wet and wild is I think working on making their entire line of vegan but until now there's one that's Ravine you ain't using now we all know what V mega glow highlighters usually look like they look like something like this I have reviewed them before I'm obsessed they've been in favorites videos not to toot their own horn but they really killed it with this formula now this one of course you see is more rectangular let's open her up it opens like this and we have a mermaid fishtail with the scales on the imprint which I love now this color I'm just going to take my clean finger right here we're just going to just watch her okay first of all it feels really soft and creamy now this color is like a wet pale Goldy like white gold let's just do a little swatch right here BAM oh wow that's blinding okay of course I'm going to put on my cheeks we're going to grab a little highlighting brush if you will alright so I'm going to turn the flashlight on my iPhone you guys because when you look up really closely there's little fine pieces of like glitter throughout the highlighter it's almost like a baby pink lavender it's really pretty hopefully you guys can see that sparkle on camera now let's try it on my face all right now the factsheet about this one says that it is fragrance free gluten free this retails for $6.99 which is very affordable formulated with nylon which helps to promote bendability and have an elegant silky texture it also features micro-fine pearl pigments which combine for a targeted multi color highlight let's just see if the damn thing works now I love wet and wild highlighters because when you go in with a brush you see like girl you got some damn payoff about to happen that is really really pretty and girl she's pigmented but like on a real level you guys maybe I shouldn't have gone so heavy-handed but it's me we're talking about so I might do 10 more layers but if you're someone that does not love a severe glow you really barely need to touch into that pan there really was not a lot of fallout it looks good on the skin though oh my god I kind of lived for this color now I am about to do lip swatches so I'm not really going to go heavy on my Cupid's bow but I will just do it over here and yeah that is like blinding I'm like oh good morning next product is the metallic liquid I shadowed now I'm normally not a fan or really use shadows that are in tubes that you can paint on I definitely have used some in the past but I've been counting now I haven't tried this formula yet so I am excited to see it it comes with a four color now it says on here that these are retail of for $4.99 these are high-impact glitter shadows that leave a shimmering multicolor shine these also have pearl pigments to anchor down the highly pigmented metallic color keeping the shadow in place cruelty free everything as well vegan great okay cool so of course there is four shades and I only have two eyes so we are going to do some swatches on my hands now a lot of the times with something like this that is dark I love to have a dark base down I normally would not go in with like this black glitter and put it on my bare lid I love to have a base down so I did do a smoky eye today of course here is no I did a smoky eye so we're going to try two colors on one lid here one lid there and then I'll do some hand swatches of course so let's get into it so I'm really feeling this blue one first this one is called aquatic prism it is really pretty well in the bottle it is so let's unscrew her not really smell so here's what the DOE foot looks like excuse my crazy backdrop it is a very flat which I love which probably means it will be easy to apply I mean let's just go in and see what happens oh okay so it's gonna act like almost like a liner I didn't do lashes today so you guys could actually see what the hell I'm doing I'm looking in the maunder and I'm impressed sorry I'm like sitting her like okay drugstore how in the hell are you doing this to me all right the next shade is called moonlight majesty and it is gorgeous like almost magenta with like a green reflex to it looks like get on my highs bitch I'm like really impressed with these now of course you guys can see that this one does not have a crazy glitter effect like this one does it's still glittery but it's a little more subdued obviously this one has like really crazy like aqua reflex I'm going to dip into here one more time and just add in a little bit more I think I wiped off too much from the brush there we go now the base of this one does seem to have a little bit more like a darker pigment so it's not as like blinding as the blue one but I still like it pretty now of course I would probably recommend to use a base under these but I am going to swatch them on my hands which of course I'm going to have an O base down but actually I'm going to show you if you put a base on the hand and if you don't I think that's only fair let's be thorough shall we so I'm going to take a little it's like a Mac Pro Longwear Paint Pot normally I use the painterly to prime my lid today we're going to use this black and we're just going to go in with my hand so I'm going to take a little brush I know I have so many tattoos but we're just gonna use the back of my hand and just pretend this is my lid and this is weird we're schedule a little arts and crafts moment here this is my eyelid right now people alright so the other colors are Laura's necklace and so we have mysterious nights which is this black one with gold glitter so here is my base which would be like my eyelid and I'll just swatch the black one real quickly this one looks something like this wow look at that holy and then here is a swatch on bare skin if you were to put this on your lids it's still really big mented like bitch they are not playing okay girl is it a tiny bit streaky err I mean barely that's pretty damn close here is of course it's like a Jade almost like very mermaid green called Lara as a Lara Laura la RA Lara's Metis and here is the shade with the base there is that one I mean she green and then let's dip in one more time and do a swatch with their skin cool here is a moonlight majesty which of course is on this eye I'm just going to do it on my bare skin so you could see what it looks like it is still cute I love that pink glitter in there so there is that color and here's of course the blue one aquatic prism and just put this right in there sorry this is like kind of awful the do hand swatches on the back of your damn hand so sorry who does not look the best but as you can see on camera pretty good all right now let's dive into the mega last metallic liquid cat suit lipsticks the user let's hold them up they look like this interesting color selection for wet and wild I will say this I was a little shook at the metallic green and blue in here I was like okay drugstore weird like a venturing out I love it now these you guys are supposed to be a weightless metallic formula that glides on smoothly and offers a full coverage pigment providing vivid color with an ultra matte finish now obviously these are metallic so they're going to look a little metallic also allegedly these have vitamin E in it to improve the appearance of texture and moisture also you guys this is um cruelty-free gluten-free everything is vegan except this shade right here called Harbor a crush so we might as well just watch this first I mean yes I'm reading all the info on my phone right here so I get all correctly let's dive in [Music] so here is Harbor a crush so watched all right now let's try this crazy green it's hard to tell my backdrop it is like a emerald green and it is called siren jewel [Music] alright now let's dive into the next trade it looks like a bronzy type of metallic color and this one is called coral crown so let's see what she looks like [Music] [Music] all right now I felt like what this shade it might need a little bit of a second layer obviously it is opaque but it was a little streaky in some areas so I'm just going to take a little bit more and put it right on top this close actually really wearable maybe a little more than I thought I wasn't sure how it looked in here but on here even with this eye look I'm like okay girl alright let's watch the fourth and final metallic shade this one is called a sea seduction and it is a deep metallic blue let's see what this bad boy looks like [Music] all right and here is the seduction still watch I really love it now overall all four did have the same consistent formula very lightweight feels good not weird this one for some reason I feel like is even more opaque than all the other one and it went on so good I mean the other ones were great but this one I think is my favorite obviously it's a little weird not every was going to be into the blues but I am digging it all right you guys the final product in this collection are the metallic liquid aligners now my eyes are already like smoke out to hell so I am just going to take the metallic shades out of the box there is three of them and it let's learn about these liners they are vegan they are going to take you from day to night with this highly pigmented eyeliner offered in rich metallic finishes as deep as the ocean each shade of course is going to have great shimmer effects pearls high impact three long lasting shades so these are supposed to be long lasting I'll have to wear this in a different video when my eyes do not already look like an alien but I do want to swatch them for you guys this green one is called sea cemetry of course the component looks something like this it has the color at the top like it's been dipped in metallic I love that finish so you know what color you are grabbing if you're in the dark or who knows what you're doing okay so you can see the brush is a very thin which I love for creating wings and I was going to do right here as normal and let's see what this looks like oh wow I was not expecting the liner to like have that much payoff I go straight away a lot of the times colored liners are like streaky and at the end of the day even though I do judge drugstore brands are really hard because I expect a lot you know and sometimes I'm let down but I'm like oh okay the shooting bad y'all I'm a little shocked this gray shade is called Trident shimmer and I've never actually really seen like a grey metallic liner let's just watch her next to this one [Music] that's pretty cool for a gray liner I guess we'll see how it drives in a second but my bad and the third one is a it looks like a deep blue and it's called the C dream okay so as you can tell this one is a little more on this tricky side compared to the other two so I'm just going to take this out and do a second layer and let's just see what happens okay so as you see layering it right away what the second coat did make it opaque so you will have to probably go in twice with the blue one but the other two look really stunning I'm not really into dark blue liner but that green though is probably my favorite just because it really pops em and stands out alright so I did wait five minutes because these do claim to be long lasting so I'm just going to take a clean finger I got no make about my hand let's just see what happens like I am so lapping my hand huh nothing really came off okay when awhile you better work all right you guys now that we have basically swatched and tried out the entire collection let's give my final dots now here's the deal 434 and 99 that's a lot of makeup for that price point I guess it is a 59 like $60 value if you were to buy them all individually so if you get the box you definitely are going to save some coin girl so let's go through it you guys I think my favorite product from the whole collection is the highlighter I am a highlighter whore and I love how this looks I keep looking in the monitor and on my camera and I'm like oh my god girl second has to be the blue metallic liquid lip I think that was my favorite shade also these are really great on the eyes I think the blue and the green one stood out the best to me I'm oldest black when it's pretty dope as well but I love how this is looking like I want to do this on this eye now it looks really really stunning if it's gorgeous I'm a little taken aback at how well this collection has works not that I've ever really doubted wet and wild well no I'm actually lying I have of them in the past definitely years ago I doubted them but they have come back so strong and they're like doing some high-end formulas for very affordable price points which i think is awesome because you guys always push me to try more drugstore products so I hope you guys enjoy this collection there really wasn't any cons for me except that one liquid lip was a little tricky and you guys saw the blue liner here it needed a second layer but overall the collection its Jeffrey sour fruit yeah the drugstore brand they are coming hard and I cannot wait to see what happens for the rest of the year but this mermaid collection bitch it's on point are you guys thank you for watching another first impression swatch video I will see you on the next one bye guys mwah

palette and collection is about so thank you guys for killing it as always of course alright so if you guys want to see how we did this crazy magic thing keep on watching so we're trying to remember you guys what we actually did on set and I wrote down a lot of notes while the Cole was doing my eyes so I think the first Shane you dipped into was sweetener sweetener lid alright yeah let's dive in so what I do with every metallic shade is I'll spray a little bit of fix+ on the back of my hand for that extra bob of I'm sure little popped with all the metallics so I'm just gonna lay a little bit of this down now of course you don't have to the shade by itself is great but if you want this extra really rich metallic love a little fix + or setting spray like you I wanted a shade that I really didn't see in a lot of palettes just something different all right now Nicole was gonna cut the crease and she uses liquid lips a lot which I live for and you guys if you don't know my formula is a vegan and I save so you can put these in your waterline and let them dry you can put them anywhere you can use a matte liner so we're gonna use shade problematic you're gonna cut your crease and then we're gonna use some red rub some Red Rum yes we might mix it elastic red cool I love watching Nicole do this part put it kind of you need to cut a so you're blending out the brush I had no product on it right yeah so I just took I'm taking a dry brush with no product on it and I'm just blending out the problematic lip up onto the brow bone mm-hmm this will give me a really nice base for what I start blending all the shadows better blend all right so now what's next next we're gonna use cherry soda okay we're gonna do this all over your brow bone and it's kind of gonna be like the middleman in between tongue pop and extraction beautiful yay and we're doing no brows today everyone we're gonna have full alien moment if you look sure sort of matches your hair it does it totally does I remember at the photo shoot we didn't know if we were gonna do brows either noise one for it [Music] and before I take it up too high I'm gonna take a little bit of tongue pop mm-hmm blend her down yeah pop I mean blender up up and down yeah [Music] Oh what I are taking some glucose what a bit of glucose and just using that right at the top here no this is like a straight-up pure matte white which I used to do all over my entire like whole entire lid and face almost back in the day is your head you're setting thought that was my study powder oh love it are we dipping into extraction we're gonna dip into extraction so we're just gonna enhance the cut crease right there so we're gonna make it a little bit darker [Music] Nicole is blending to filled it's coming together what's that mean together we're gonna take a little bit more glucose okay so we're gonna build underneath your eye now okay and we're gonna pack this right here in the front holy shit mm-hmm she has pigment so wait whoa girl I love that now we're gonna cut your bottom crease that's what we use here at Brown don't you forgot you guys mid tutorial we're like where do we put the Redrum liquid lip yeah under oh we also did this shoot like a couple weeks ago so I forgot like yeah I'm pretty but remember now we go right underneath that white shadow [Music] actually before it drives all the way I'm gonna blend it out a little bit [Music] so now right here at the base I'm gonna take a little bit of coma the darkest shade in the palette darkest shade in the palette I'm gonna set this guy's here dog barking its draw fun downstairs yelling her head off she's in full play mode so we're gonna take some root canal okay this is one of my favorite colors in this palette I'm gonna buff this out right underneath coma [Music] we're going to dip into prick which is a sheet over here it's like this really beautiful bright orange it's nuts right it's like an orange trade red hybrid and of course this has the needle and stamped into the powder which of course this one has the medical symbol over here I had to switch it up a little bit and I thought these very fittings I love to name it prick yeah so where you gonna put that again I'm gonna put this right under here okay right in the front just a little bit this for some detailing mm-hmm oh my god it looks so sick it's like okay eyeliner next all right eyeliner liquid yeah got liquid yeah favorite Tom word the best if you guys have never tried this the little pricey but it's so good its dual ended so it has like a finer point for detailing and then a bigger point and it's just like it's quick it is so fast [Music] I'm going to finish up the eyeliner so I'm gonna pull this in to a little point right in here oh you're gonna have some black in there mmm bright in between okay coos and sweetener let me hold my breath all right it's almost time for lashes so I'm gonna quickly pop in some contacts before my eyes get crazy and we do all the glue so I will be right back contact lenses are in first of all look at these short nails girl don't judge me okay so I am going to quickly do mascara and liner now I prefer to do this on myself no matter who does my makeup because my eyes they're not sensitive but when someone's going in there I don't know wise for some reason when you do it yourself it just doesn't water so I'm going to do the mac cosmetics fascinating white and smolder with of course the iconic Benefit Cosmetics roller lash be right back we got liner mascara on and now it's time for some lashes my favorite part I think like this is one of Nicole signature moments it's just kind of got flashes and slanging the face well we're going to start with bottom lashes and kind of even bottom me doing this duo vegan lash glue so you're putting that right where we started that shadow wine so it's actually underneath your real lashes damn just feel like I love it like little butterflies like resting my cheeks tickling all

I am a nice smooth and ready so today we're gonna go in with my Avila red lip scrub and shade cherry soda oh this is so yummy girl when I have the munchies at night half the jar it's a wrap but today we're just gonna use them to prep the lips you are gonna feel so smooth they've been for a snack bitch I know we're hungry and then sometimes if there's sugar on my face I will take a Beauty Blender and just wipe it off oh yeah [Music] mm-hmm such a good tip to to use a brush if you guys pull real hombre love using a brush all right now for setting sprayer we're gonna use a little skin de Naevia this is the bridal makeup finishing spray I think it's fitting yeah hose me down bride-to-be this is a good look for like when the priest just like does anyone object and I burst in the room looking like this like I do we're done you guys this is almost what we need some hair on yeah because I look like a bald bitch right now but I think red to match Nicole I'm a red red everything you guys this

slicks me down yeah and then this is a wig cap we already did the foundation in so don't judge our wonder stands we catch up the budget okay so the one like they're probably yeah so we put foundation on the wig cap so they blend into what we're about to do [Music] so just for the record you guys when we do like photoshoots and this type of stuff like I know real drag queens I glue everything down I don't really do that unless we're going to events now if we don't know I had hair surgery like Oh like almost two years ago actually which there is a video on me having a whole crazy procedure done

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I'm about to suck and see if the mascara stays on mic drop okay but for real but that's exactly what we were doing today we are trying out the Urban Decay new troublemaker mascara now I've tried mascaras on this channel before we've done the hourglass stainless steel we've done the new laurio drugstore mascara which I still love and we all know that Benefit Cosmetics roller lash is my favorite mascara on the planet but we have a particular today there is a new mascara that just hit the market and it is allegedly sex proof yes that's exactly what it says on the box so I'm gonna need to call Nathan for this one I don't know if I can do this video alone for now I'm going to attempt to apply this mascara we're gonna talk about it we're gonna feel it we're gonna touch it we're gonna play with it and then we're gonna see if it stays put so if you want to see if this mascara works then keep on watching alright you guys so here is what the box came in the mail looking like this is PR from Urban Decay they did send me this of course and it says hashtag here comes trouble right on there now I do love the hollow packaging I'm sure it's gonna come in a smaller box of course when it is in stores but oh and here's the box I haven't even looked at it just keeping it real alright so this says super fat super long sex proof mascara alright garage is that big statement so it comes like this I'm assuming this is a box of course yes so let me just pop these bad boys out of here and all right so it says stir up trouble with thirteen point seven times the lash of volume I like this you know carton it is definitely very urban decay we got the purple going on behind me we got the periwinkle row but this mascara has a net weight of 0.25 ounces 0.33 this is the new Lancome Moser and then the roller lash has 0.30 so I guess that is that's kind of standard alright so what is this mascaras supposed to do first of all it looks like this I love the component I think it looks a very cute I love the oil slick packaging I love the it's like this clear I don't know it's just I think by now we've all seen a million mascaras what could they do packaging wise that is going to excite us definitely exciting this will retail for $24 which is pretty normal for a mascara that is high-end and in Sephora the box says a bunch of shit so we're just gonna skim through and see what this product is supposed to do to my eyes now of course you guys see I did very light I makeup I didn't do any mascara nothing really just very you know soft so the box says that this is so good it should be illegal this is supposed to have volume eyes and lengthen as it separates while our custom brush grabs onto lashes and curls as it coats we loaded up this mess scar with insane benefits okay so what does it have in here it is supposed to ask outlast the most scandalous nights and still look good in the morning okay that is a big claim on here so besides that we're going to go on over to the website and see what it says okay so this has a vitamin e in it which is gonna nourish and condition okay here we go the brush now I've heard a lot of things about the brush online first of all let's open her up and let's see what the brush looks like first and foremost oh oh it's Mikey okay so almost looks like it has a mohawk going right here let me hold my head up in front of it and then as you see you turn it it's like shorter hairs but it does look a very spiky it looks a little dangerous and I'm kind of into it it says we designed it to calm and separate lashes to make it look like you have more of them tiny precision hooks grab lashes to pull the product through alright you guys so basically obviously they're you know there ain't there ain't nothing like crazy about it it's a mascara we're gonna apply it to our eyes nothing Crazy's gonna happen either it works and I like it or it doesn't work and then I am going to ask Nathan to take me to the bedroom and I don't know we're gonna see what happens in 30 minutes and if it stays on it stays on if it doesn't we gonna have a problem urban decay all right you guys know I normally don't ever curl my lashes you will hardly ever see this in my hand I haven't time to know my body though but I am going to give it a fair shot because every time that lipstick Nick does my makeup she always has me curl my own lashes so I'm like you know what let me at least give it a whirl so I'm just gonna do this like a normal person must feel so weird I never do this you guys alright so those are my normal lashes look like I think by now you all know what the fuck they look like alright so we are going to give this a whirl now the bristles look really sharp there looks like there is a lot of product on the wand I'm gonna hold it out with the backdrop so you can really see it one more time and let's see if it hooks in [Music] so here is the right side of course with it only on the top and here is what my normal eyes look like do you see a difference y'all will have to tell me right now all right I'm gonna do the bottom mascara I'm gonna dunk in one more time like I normally would and notice how this one definitely has that crazy like rubber type of whoo it bends so now let's do the bottoms all right so the bottom lashes are coated I'm actually really liking how this is looking all right you guys so here is the side with the mascara and here is my normal boring blank side over here you guys tell me what you think of the difference all right now I am going to quickly do this side and then we're gonna put this bitch to the test alright so the mascara is on both eyes now I'm actually really liking how it's looking it definitely hooked in there it curled the lashes of course this is also a first impressions besides seeing if it works I love how it made the bottoms look they're very separated they look pretty the top ones are nice I would definitely wear this by itself without falsies and just let it live so overall I do like how it looks right away which is great now if the real question is where's Nathan hey baby I'm babe alright so you don't even know why we're here not really no no Nate's been growing weed in the desert for a few weeks that were just we're just wrapping out right now okay so today babe we are trying out you know urban decay love them they have a new mascara six proof mm-hmm alright so this out we are if you're in the mood I mean I mean I mean I'm always in the mood so basically this is supposed to be a sex proof mascara so I thought we could literally I mean look we're we're doing life experiments here on YouTube I think the Jeffrey star has taken YouTube to the next realm with get readies and jets Royals Royces crazy vlogs around the world so I'm like a look at the end of the day we really gotta test this out so I figured we would go into the bedroom for I don't know 20 30 minutes and just see if this is gonna work alright now it's supposed to stay on at all costs at all costs a I mean it doesn't say super fast super long six proof but yeah so hey this is it okay I like the cool oil slick look to it though it doesn't come off additional bag I love all right cool so I guess we're gonna go see if I can get pregnant oh all right guys we'll be right back come on baby [Music] all right you guys this is the fucking funny Asia I think I've ever done in my channel I have spit all over me alright so this is what happened after 10 minutes of in the shower yeah I mean it looks like it's running it's running I look up and my eyes are kind of burning right now you guys so I don't know what is going on obviously the mascara is probably in my eyes but we're gonna zoom in right here and you guys are gonna see this is what oral sex this what happens after oral sex in 10 minutes so let me look at let me zoom in on myself real quick alright oh my god first of all I have saliva on all over me alright you guys well I don't really have much of a gag reflex at all so it took me a minute to get some tears going and some sweat we turned on the steamer in the shower oh and ha yeah and definitely smeared so here's the good news I just quit people when I say this the good news is is that I actually liked how the product lied I like the wand I love the bristles the wand I love the bristles and I liked how my lashes look pre prior to this right right yes did it hold up in the shower and there was no water on my face obviously you guys see my highlight still poppin I do have spit all over my face but it did drip it did not stay on it really didn't and there was no water on me there was nothing like crazy obviously cuz my shadow stole a girl but yeah I just wanted to you not touch anything and run in here and show you guys exactly what happened so is the Urban Decay troublemaker mascara sex proof well it sure ain't steam and dick proof it's not you know ten minutes of fucking around and this happened so I don't think it's sex proof at all obviously I'm not sure what the formula is if it's supposed to be waterproof I mean sex proof is a big statement it is a very bold statement and it didn't work you guys I'm so sad urban decay with them I definitely used my all nighter setting spray and my foundation looks laid still my highlight looks beaming yes I mean maybe this helped face it definitely didn't get wet obviously no so this is kind of weird I'm like on the fence because I don't want to jeffree star approves late necessarily if it did not do everything instead it was going to do but good news is I actually love the formula would you mind using it again and I thought that it made my lashes look really really pretty so if you just want a new great mascara that will stay on when you were at work I definitely highly recommend this one but if you want to get on your knees and still look great afterwards I do not recommend this one so yeah it's not too if we start proof but I like how it looks so you guys already you know you get it you get the gist you get the gist so didn't work here but I loved how it looked before this well that was probably the funniest thing we've ever done on my channel yeah I would say so besides everyone thinking I used your nutsack to blend out my foundation yeah that was pretty good which that did not happen but is it not I mean yeah hopefully YouTube is not restrict or flagged this video I was just testing out a makeup product and that is that there was nothing x-rated about this one so YouTube don't play a bitch thanks for coming on again baby it's my pleasure alright we are going to go finish what we started thank you guys so much for watching and what do we say can't wait to see on the next one we'll see you on the next one bye guys 
What's up everybody?
Welcome back to my channel. Today we are going to be diving
into some brand new products that I just got in the mail from a brand
called "Storybook cosmetics". Now I know a lot of you have
seen their, I'm going to say, the Harry Potter inspired make up
brushes that they came out with. They look something like this. I know a lot of Video YouTubers have tested
these out. I ordered them a while ago, got them in the mail and I haven't
tried them out yet because I was waiting for their
eye shadow palette to come in. Now I pre-ordered it, I think about
like a month and a half ago, I said, "You know what, let me wait to try the brushes for
when the palette comes" and the day is finally here. So, I have a quick confession to make, I have
never fully watched a Harry Potter movie. I know, don't, I know all of you
at home are like "[babble]". Now Nathan is a huge fan of Harry Potter,
he has watched all the movies, he's been to the amusement park
at Universal Studios here in Los Angeles. He has every book, seen every
movie, probably like ten times. I've watched the first
one halfway through and it was a really late night and
I may have fell asleep on the couch. No tea, no shade. I know a lot of you or most
of you have watched Harry Potter and you know way more than me. So the eyeshadow palette
comes in this beautiful little velvet casing. And then you pull it out and it looks like this.
I love it, like the packaging is stunning. Now, this is $52, retail. Now it's thick.
You guys can see, it looks like a like a book that you would obviously put in on
your shelf at home in your library, if you will. So you open it up and it has
a giant mirror, which I love. And it has twelve shades. So I of course have
not swashed these yet, I haven't tried them. So on their website it actually says that
there are three formulas in this palette. There is  a matt, a metallic
and then a pearl. It also says that this is a vintage style
storybook complete with gold foil detailing, I mean girl, we see
the packaging, it's stunning. Now here's one thing
that I find a little strange. Asked Nate to come up and look
at this and I said, are these symbols or anything that is like real Harry Potter because
on the website it says that Storybook Cosmetics is proud of this unique
original creation inspired by all the magical stories
they grew up with and loved. This palette is not sponsored by,
endorsed by, or associated in any way with the owners or creators of any
other pre-existing literary or artistic work. So I know that in the future
this brand is saying that they're going to license other brands and
do kind of like collaboration type things. But I thought this was licensed through Harry Potter
and definitely inspired by Harry Potter. But on the website I guess they don't want probably
to get sued by the creator of Harry Potter. So I said, Nate, what does this
packaging look to you like to you? And he said, it is very like based
on the Slytherin part of the books. And this is very Slytherin and he said that
the "S" on the thing looks like the Slytherin font. So I was looking Slytherin up on my phone and definitely
the snake or this "S" does kind of look like this. I mean obviously there's Harry Potter
inspired probably for legal reasons they can't say that or maybe they
couldn't get the license. Is Harry Potter ever going to come
out with cosmetics, who knows. But I obviously think it's amazing, and I'm not throwing
any shade I just was a little confused by that. I didn't even know what
Slytherin was and then I found out that I actually run and control it
because yes, I am Lord Voldemort. As so many people on YouTube have tried
to call me that, Oh My Girl, that's an insult. So I have already, of course, done my foundation,
my contour and my highlight. I have just, primed the lid with some Mac
Painterly Pink Pot and of course, I know you're all going to be like "Girl,
what is that highlight, it's a little blinding." This is from the brand Joey Cosmetics,
and it is called Skinny Dip. Girl, I've been going in
on that pan. Don't try me. And, let's open up this baby. I love that you can
fold the mirror back and it kind of sits on your vanity. It's really pretty. I love the shade names
are a little different than a normal brand. They are very like, I just love
the font. It's really cool. So I am going to go in first with this matt shade,
and I'm going to go on the website and make sure. Oh no, this is not matt, my bad. On the website
it says that it is a pearly, white. So it is a pearl formula, so I definitely
do not want that as my transition color. So I'm probably going to go in with
Charms, it says it is a shell pink, it looks more kind of like a beigey, like camel
tone, so I guess we're going to try that first. Alright, so let's see, by dipping in
for the first time, what these look like. Oh, I mean that coated the brush
immediately. Which I appreciate. I don't want my hair to get in the way so
we're just going to clip her back as always. So I'm just going to take this shade Charms
and we're just going to put it right in the crease. Now I do have no brows today.
I've been loving the no brow look. There's just something fun
and I haven't done it in a while. Now first impressions, I like to tilt my head all
the way back, ooh that's a really soft, pretty color. Like, that is really
pretty and light. Sometimes I don't like transition
shades to be really, really intense. Depending on the look, I don't even know
what kind of look I'm going to do today. We're just going to roll with it. I will say this, this brush is easy
to hold, because as you see when I'm holding it my fingers go right in
the groove of here, and yeah, it's really nice. Alright, so that blended out really nicely.
Now of course there's only five brushes, so I am going to have to go into
my personal collection and grab a few. There is a shade that
is really pretty in here. It is called Broomstick, it is like
this chocolate matt brown up here. Now I am just going to take, what kind of brush
shall we use. Okay, I haven't used this one. Let's try her out. This has the little gold medallion
on it. Definitely coated the brush immediately. Now to soften that I'm going
to go back in with this brush and what I like to do is like
I like to mix a lot of the times so I'll take the brush and literally
once go into that color, or twice, and then I'll dip into the other one just so
it kind of gives me a little blend, if you will. And then I'll go right in there where
I put that chocolate brown and I will blend up, just so it looks
very seamless and very airbrushed. So now I'm going to try the shade Sorcerer.
It is this ruby red metallic. I'm just going to pop a little bit into the crease
just to give it some flair and a little bit of color. And I'm just going to take it, and I'm
not going to go all the way down, I'm just going to start from the middle
and just kind of go over the brown. So now we have three shadows
in here and ooh, this looks pretty. Oh right, you guys.
I love how this is looking. Now I do want to add some kind of pop above
the color and kind of blend these all together. So I am going to go in with this pearl, white shade
color, the Prophecy and I'm just going to take a… I know I use this a lot for highlighting
but the little morphy five ten, and I'm just going
to go into that color. I'm just going to take this and kind of put it above
the shadows that have already blended together and now we're just going to add a little
extra flair and pop to it. Ooh, okay. So if you do have an eyebrow of course
you're going to put this color right bellow your brow hairs and it is going
to pop and look stunning. Oh right, you guys.
I love how this is looking so far. Now I'm going to go in with the shade called
Bewitched. It is a coppery gold metallic. Now of course I'm going to try
it without, Oh wow. Come on girl. I was going to wet the brush
but I might not have to. I'm just going to pop this on my
lid and let's see how it looks. If I think I need it, like I need some fixed plus
I will, but let's see how it's going to pack on. Oh wow. Hmm. Okay pigmey,
that's not bad you guys. Okay, this is applying as if I'll have
that kind of already wet the brush, I'm a little shook right now.
I'm not going to lie. All right you guys, I just tuck some
of the gold shade, Bewitched in here. Now I'm really, like, feeling this blue
shade Merlin and I really want to try it so I'm going to go in with a little Tom Ford
pencil brush and let's see dab in here. Now usually blues have a fall out with
bran but just going in here, not at all. The brush is fully coated. Let's just try
this out, so I'm going to take this and just really slowly work it
under the lash line and be very careful cause I don't know
if there's going to be fall out or not. I'm going to take this brush with a little bit of that
transition color that we first started with. And just kind of go underneath the blue and
soften it. Alright, this shade looks stunning. Now I'm going to take some
Mac Smoulder eye pencil and just kind of tuck that in the water line.
Ooh, I'm about to sneeze. Ooh, my Lord. All this powder
is up my nostrils girl. Alright, let me take this pencil. It was a little
cold, going to warm that bitch up. Okay. Now I am going to do some
mascara of course, no shocker here. I'm going to be going in with my Benefit Roller
lash and let's get these lashes ready. Alright you guys. This look is really complete.
I'm not going to do false lashes today. I'm kind of living because I haven't worn make-up in
a few days, so my real lashes are actually like "ooh". They're like long and pretty,
so I'm going to keep that. But I am going to go with my Urban Decay All
Nighter Setting Spray, give her a little shakee and we are about to set this make up and then we're
going to dive into some swatches real quickly and see what the rest of the palette
looks like. But first, let's set. Ooh, she's feeling refreshed baby. Alright, now, let's get to swatching. Alright, so I'm going to do some finger swatches
of the other shades that I did not get to use today. I will of course use them in the future. Now this
matt grey one called Cloak looks amazing. So I'm going to take some clean fingers and we're
just going to go in like that. And ooh, hello. And we're just going to do this on my hand
real quickly just to see what they look like. Huh. Oh, that is really
pretty bitch. What. Now we are going to do this
metallic green, it is called Potions so I'm going to go in with this finger
and then we'll go in with Salem, over here, and let's
see what these look like. Here is Potions, bam, ooh, that is pretty. Now my hand
has no primer, has nothing on it. This is just bare skin and here is Salem.
Ooh, that is like a little duo chrome moment. hat's pretty. Now we have Cauldron
right here and then we have Spellbook. So let's take Cauldron with this finger,
I'm running out of fingers y'all. And we'll just do right here. Ooh, that' is a pretty
like blackish grey. Alright, now we're going to do Spellbook with
my thumb and then we're out of hands here. We're out of hands, we're out of fingers.
Right, so I'm just going to do that right there. Ooh, that one is stunning. Okay, I'm just going to say this okay. We're going
to swatch one more, so there's one called Jinx. I'm going to clean this finger
real quickly on a paper towel. Alright, so this finger has been cleaned, we're going
to go dip into this shade right here called Jinx. And let's see what this one looks like.
Ooh, it's almost like a, like a silvery pearl. Let's just go in. Ooh, it's like a grey,
silver, pearl all in one. Okay. Hmm. I'm like, that is so pretty. I might have
to like a highlight too. Hey you guys. So I'm going to give
you my final thoughts right now. I already have the answer, I will say this. I'm sure
you guys are not going to be shocked by this, but the Storybook Cosmetics Wizardry and Witchcraft
Eyeshadow Palette is Jeffree Star approved. Now of course you guys can see from putting it on
my eyes and these swatches, this palette has pigment. Now, for $52 and all the shades
you get with the packaging and everything combined,
it is definitely worth the money. I think that this palette is stunning, the pigmentation
is on point and for an Indy brand I am very impressed and I'm really
happy to support a company like this because I think they really knocked it
out of the park with this launch. Now the brushes I will say were pretty good.
I did not know what to expect because I was like "okay, the handles are amazing, but are the bristles
going to be cheap or are they going to be nice". They're not the best brushes on earth, they definitely
kind of feel like that vegan synthetic type of I don't want to don't want to say drug store,
but kind of drug store brushes I guess. Of course the packaging is stunning, but it blended
out everything great, there was no problems, it didn't drag or make anything
look patchy. It was pretty good. Now I know that they are coming
out with a lot more stuff. They have brushes that look like
real roses which of course I have pre-ordered because I know you guys
are all going to ask me to try them out, so those will be coming I think in next month. I love that this brand lets you pre-order
stuff and then it comes in a few weeks or a month later so you know there's no anxiety
like "Oh my God am I going to get one" and they do restock often and
have several pre-orders so I don't… I think this palette is sold out
right now, but of course who knows if we're going to be watching
this today, tomorrow or in a month. So check on their site if you want to get this
and I'm sure they're going to come out with a lot more stuff so I'm really
pleased with this brand. So shout out to you ladies,
you guys are on an amazing start. Thank you guys so much for watching
this tutorial and this first impressions and I will see you on the next one.
Bye guys. Love you. 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we are going to be diving into the brand new Kylie cosmetics purple eyeshadow palette we got some brand new fall liquid lips and we have a new highlighter from her brand it all came together in this little black bag so we are going to dive into everything today we're gonna pull it out we're gonna swatch it we're gonna try to do a little look with it and we're gonna see if the formula is consistent with everything from the past now I haven't reviewed anything Kylie in a while on my channel the last collection it wasn't mind-blowing it was a little lackluster in my opinion just for the design and the color for me it was just kind of like yeah and that's okay I think a lot of people take that and that's like a negative doesn't mean you hate a brand doesn't mean you don't like somebody it just means you're really not into that palette or that moment so if you want to see me try everything inside of here thank you for watching so this collection comes with BAM this is the purple palette now everything is in matte black packaging which I kind of live for we are in the month of October so when you feel it it is like a soft touch so there is a palette we are gonna create a little ilyich with it today and then how many liquid lips do we have in here five liquid lip Libra wicked butternut hazel and autumn and they of course are all black with the colors on the lips alike and normal now we all know that these lip kits are retail for twenty nine dollars and they do come with a liquid lip and a lip liner the palette is 42 dollars we just got to open her up and see what the healthy even in here of course I have reviewed the bronze palette and the burgundy palette on my channel laughs no not earlier this year so here is the purple palette if you've never seen it Kylie eyeshadow palette before her first and her second one's ever released had this packaging so the teardrops of course are going to match the colors that are on the inside so we are going to open her up and here is what she looks like now I do want to note that I'm really glad that they started to add mirrors in these palettes because the first two did not have a mirror and the internet was running their damn mouth so of course you get a nine pen palette and this is the color scheme Wow now I will say this before I even try this purple eyeshadows are hard to make I don't know why well I do know why but why they're so difficult to make it has to do with the pigments and how you make everything so if you notice other brands do purple eyeshadows bitch you see me struggle on this channel with some Purple's they are hard to make we are about to put this on my eyes right now and besides that oh we can't forget the highlighters there is a Reaper motion of three of the loose powder highlighters from the vacation collection which me and Nathan reviewed a few months ago I'll link that down below alright but besides the three that she is reap remoting there is a new one called wisteria and it looks like this let's just open her up anyway my cheeks don't have any metallics I almost want to do that first oh oh this is like a shimmery like purple maybe I want to highlight on my face right now so I'm gonna just do this first before we even do the eye looks let me pour some out like I normally do oh wow this is a lot of purple glitter and here is that on the brush we're gonna do a little zooming girl look at that alright enough talking let's see if it applies on my cheeks Oh oh my god it's literally like ice on my cheeks let me blend it out so it doesn't look as crazy okay wait a minute as I'm blending it out it did definitely diffuse alright so when I first swiped it it was really intense and then as I moved it around with the brush it got more sheer so if you're someone that likes a little bit of a like a whimsical moment this is cute for you if you want it to pack a punch you can wet your brush with fix+ or layer on just for shits and giggles I'm going to try a morphe fan brush this is what I used to always put on highlighter with and let's see if it applies any different with the fan okay alright so when applying this of course you do see that it's sheer I am someone that likes more of a blinding highlight so I'm just gonna try one thing I'm just gonna spray my cheek with some morphe prep and set and let's go in one more time and let's see how this applies oh there we go so there is this side with no fix+ and then here is this side which one do you guys like more I kind of like this so more let's keep it gangster so I'm just knocking on my door I had a package and I went downstairs for a few minutes grabbed a drink I'm back upstairs and no tea no shade but this highlighter it's like a very glittery where it really didn't stick to the skin like I'm looking over here on my gaff it looks pretty because the beauty lights are all reflecting but like if I just want like that I'm like it comes off really easy definitely not the same consistency I feel like as the vacation collection which they're sitting right here so I'm gonna take one out and see if this is the same as the other formula that came out this summer because girl something may add enough all right so here is Center eenie we're just gonna pour a little bit in here I'm just gonna take a this is a good clean powder brush I'm just gonna go like this once girl really like there's hardly any highlighter let me just go like this hmm we're gonna take the other color Santorini let's just apply that to the cheeks bitch you see that motherfuckin glow that's what I'm talking about all right so if you were someone that wants a little more of a subtle glow you might want to go with wisteria wisteria I'm probably saying it wrong but look at the end of the day the formula is definitely not the same there is a little bit of an inconsistency there so we're gonna start off the review with some real fucking tea but look at the fucking lighthouse that I just put on my damn cheek like that is what I'm talking about all right let's jump into the eyeshadow palette all right you guys so let's see if these eyeshadows are consistent with the previous formula so of course we saw this in the intro BAM so of course the shade names are on the back of here and of course they're on the back of here in case you forget now this palette is interesting this is fall time and I think that everyone always kind of like does the same thing so I'm not mad at this color story at all I think that so many people stick to we know what they know and basic brown shadows so I think it's really cool that she at least it's something different y'all can't hate on it alright so of course before I do any eye tutorial I always use my Mac painterly paint-pot so we are gonna bust that out today and we're just gonna take a little Mac synthetic brush right here and okra just get worn in I'm member and this is brand new all right so I'm just gonna take a little bit on the brush not a lot now I do have deep sockets that go in so I go all the way even up a little bit because we are gonna put some shadow up there all right so we're gonna take this brush we're gonna go to this top left shade right here and it's called periwinkle girl periwinkle is like purplish color whatever okay so this one is a shimmer of course let me just go like this yep it is definitely a pale shimmer it almost looks like the highlighter I'm wearing on my cheeks okay that has some shimmer to it someone's gonna take us to do this on my brow bone I know most of you have brow so you will skip this part or you can put this below your brow bone oh I like this because it looks wet it's almost like wet metal and I'm down for it this one blended really great it obviously has a lot of pigment definitely blinding let's move on and now we are going to take a little fluffy brush and we are going to go in with shade blueberry it is like this grayish color it definitely has a little bit of a blue undertone I'm just gonna take that and I'm going to just blend it right there in the crease and let's see how it looks so what I loved about putting down a shiny base or anything like that is that when you're blending this it's very thick effortless where you're just kind of like buffing and blending up take your time and then it will look very seamless we're gonna take a little bit more we're gonna put it right where my eyelids sink in of course and then we're gonna bring it down a little bit so it's almost like a little sea motion right on the lid as well [Music] so blueberry she's pigmented it blended really nice and I really like how this looks all right I think I'm gonna take what is a shade called lilac this soft purple right here and ooh it's coated the brush really good so you know this shit is about to blend hopefully now I'm gonna take this color and I'm gonna put it actually here so we're gonna press that right on the lid oh and I'm gonna actually take that and I like to take my shadows a little further in especially with no brow and put that right in there oh girl I love this lid color okay cute now this and the intro when I said purples were difficult to make light colors easy peasy but these type of colors are a little difficult so I'm just gonna take a little bit I'm gonna put it I'm trying to rein the middle kinda okay she's cute it's buildable now this one definitely has a lot of fallout we'll show the palette right now here's all the colors I've touched into and what they look like I'm taking the brush this is like a round brush this one is the number 19 from Chanel so we're gonna take this and I'm actually gonna tuck it into my crease so I'm gonna actually look up so you guys can see exactly what's going on and just press it in there and just kind of go like that alright before we do the other side I do want to zoom in a little bit cuz that color girl I might need to spray the brush look at my look at my face like all that fall out so what do we do we'll go take a little Laura Mercier powder and if the shadows are already on the face I like to just brush away like that really lightly and just pray it doesn't stick to your skin because then you gotta fix your foundation and a redo at all of course we definitely need some lashes today but I think I'm gonna do what other what other I wish I could talk to you guys right now what other colors do you guys want to see definitely that is not my vibe a bronze color for this purple look I'm not feeling so maybe we do these two and just smoke out the lower lashline a little bit add some white liner and make it pop do some lashes and smoke a bowl so let's get to it let me take my trusty fascinating white pencil from Mac this is such an easy creamy formula that just goes right in the waterline and this is gonna make the look really pop [Music] and now we're gonna take wine and dine and turning violet or maybe we're gonna mix these up let's just see how this one performs by itself I'm loving the full purple everything vibes we will just run that under the eye very lightly this is like full purple smokey eye today alright now I'm gonna take a tiny bit of wine and dine this color right here and I'm just going to deepen the outer edges on the waterline like right below it so we're just gonna just a little hint of color we're gonna deepen right in here alright so this look is definitely missing some mascara and lashes so I'm gonna go quickly do it off camera and I'll be right back alright so of course I wiped off the lip we are about to swatch all day liquid lipstick put on lashes and then it kind of hid all of the eye shadows so I'm gonna live with the fantasy of just mascara and of course so I don't have to tell you benefit roller lash BAM back to the Kylie cosmetics matte liquid lipsticks of course you guys know these also come with a liner i just opened all them and pulled them out we have five shades i'm gonna swatch them on my hands i think a few of these normal like nudes and i don't you just watch all five maybe if i don't you guys are gonna fight me at home let's just see how my lips feel for the first shade i'm gonna swatch of course we're we're in the fall vibes people so this shade is called autumn it looks something like this now you guys know they do come with lip liners i hardly ever use them i just go in with the wand and see what happens same I call it licorice same scent as all of them have previously been since the beginning of her launch you know I'm not the biggest fan of it but I whatever it is what it is okay [Music] all right here is autumn it is almost dried down now of course with this I look I don't love it but by itself like let's pretend my lids are not purple I love this color by itself like right now with the blonde hair I love it with purple not so much okay so this color is cute love it formula same as before as all her other ones will know they're not always consistent we have seen that on this channel but this one is it feels fine and yeah let's move on let's move on to the next color and now we are going to dive into the shade wicked which is this purple here purple eyes purple lips pink and purple shirt it might look a little too much or it could be thumbnail worthy let's find out [Music] okay now I know this is a lot of purple going on here but I kind of live for it this one speaking of inconsistencies this one was a little bit more hard to apply I need like two layers and it's a little more dry than the first one I don't know why maybe it's the pigments or the color but yeah but overall I think it looks cute and yeah let's move on alright that purple had some sort of like red base to it which a lot of Purple's do stay in my mouth a little bit but I did try to cover with foundation but um that color is a little dry just putting it out there okay next color is Libra and this is a very light nude you have to be a pale bitch to use this or you can put it in the center of an ombre maybe but this looks really light in here so let's see how it applies oh wow bitch that's like the color of my damn skin tone [Music] all right here is libres watch now even though it is really light I'm always down for an ood and I think since my eyes are so like intense this color actually now that's dry it's a little darker than my skin tone and I'm I don't mind it I think it's really pretty and I am a nude lipstick whore so this is probably my favorite so far okay so actually Nathan and I are about to a good dinner and I'm gonna keep this nude lip on because of my mouth it's hurting girl this formula when you wipe it off like look at my little my mouth parts so I'm not gonna leave you guys hanging I am gonna swatch the last two this one is called hazel girl we just gonna put it right on my hand you guys know the drill when I do that you can obviously see oh this one has full opacity and this color is pretty it reminds me of something - I'd like an honest hacia color I have but it is definitely a warm toned caramel brown I love it it is really pretty but this one butternut I don't know girl mmm I think this is like maybe one of the very few colors that she's released and I'm like I don't know if that colors for me let's put it on oh no not on me baby mm-hmm to me this looks like I don't know what does it remind me of like a diaper a diaper I'm so fucking dumb you guys okay it just looks a little not my favorite everything else loved it the purple was a little dry for me this one I just personally would not wear I'm sure some of y'all can rock the fuck out of that color but this shade was probably my favorite so okay we've seen all the colors we've seen everything no let's give my final thoughts alright you guys so I'm sure you all are wondering and a lot of you fast forward to this part so I'm just gonna say it out loud here and now the Kylie cosmetics purple palette hit jeffrey's are approved yes clearly you guys all saw at work I think the colors blended amazing definitely an improvement since a few pallets ago there's a few issues I had with it but it seems to be fixed and everything performed great there was of course extreme fallout with this shade down here but once I tilted my head and pressed it in in a different technique it was fine the mattes blended all great the shimmers obviously bitch blinding here let's talk about the lips all the lips were great except the purple was a little too drying for me I don't mind one thing stain my lips because that happens it's makeup clearly we've all been through that before whether it's the lids or the mouth makeup stains once in a while I just didn't like that it was a little more drying than the other ones and a little streaky I definitely had to put two layers on which made it more heavy and trying to meet every other color was great of course I did not put the last two on my lips but Adam and Libra were amazing the other one seemed fine when I applied them on my hand there was no streakiness at all only things so the liquid lips except the purple or jeffree star approved the only things that were not quite up to par for me was of course the wicked liquid lip and then the wisteria highlighter girl this was a flop for me this is not approved I definitely had to put a different highlighter on top of it for a pop but of course you know my standards of highlighting and this was not it but the other ones that are reprimanded are definitely great so overall we got a lot of hits and a few misses so hopefully you guys got something out of this video if you want to purchase anything now you know what the fuck is up and you know what to buy so thanks for watching guys and I will see you on the next one mwah 
What’s up, everybody.
Welcome back to my channel. Now listen, bitch, I just landed from
London. The jetlag is sinking in. But I got this package in the mail
of something a little special and I was like, “You know what? Let’s pause the sleep
deprivation and let’s get to work.” So, as you guys may have seen
all over Snapchat and Twitter, me and Manny were just in the UK
celebrating our collab. It was such an incredible,
amazing trip and I literally got back like
a few hours ago. So, when I was unboxing all of my packages
that I had boughten and gotten, I stumbled across the new Kim Kardashian-West
and Kylie Cosmetics collaboration. I know you guys have seen
this all over the internet. Kylie has been swatching it and wearing it.
So has Kim all over Snapchat and Twitter. So I thought, listen, y’all know I’ve reviewed
a lot of Kylie stuff on my channel. Some of it’s amazing. Some of it
is so-so. And you know me. I’m always going to give you my unfiltered,
motherfucking opinion. So, if you want to see me talk about this
collection, I’m going to do swatches, I’m going to review it, I’m gonna talk about it…
then you might wanna keep on watching. So basically for this set, Kim Kardashian
created her own formula for the Kylie Cosmetics brand. We all know we’ve tried her Liquid
lips that are long-lasting. We’ve tried the Velvet Liquid Lipsticks,
and now we have a new formula called the Crème Liquid Lipstick formula. So, basically this is supposed to mimic Kim’s signature nude look. We all know
Kim wears nude lipsticks all the time. Her makeup is very iconic. She helped catapult,
you know, highlight and contour, basically. Her and J. Lo were like the fore-fronters
for the contour craze that you see today. So, when I saw this collection, the packaging…
you guys know I’m a packaging whore. I really loved it. Let’s open her up.
I love that everything is nude. You know, Mac Cosmetics did a little
nude collection a year or two ago where all the components were nude, and
I was like [deep intake of breath]. It just looks so classy and pretty. Now,
normally the component…that’s what I like to call it…the bottle, the lipstick itself,
if you will, is normally not frosted. So giving it the frost look with the new drips
and the cap and everything in the font I think looks very classy. I think
the bundle box itself looks cute. Now the colors…there’s some
light nudes. I will say that. Obviously, Kim and Kylie are not my shade.
I am very pale. Kim is obviously more darker. She is from Armenian descent. And these
nudes are obviously gonna look a little different on her,and I know that
she wears nudes all the time. So…but when I first
saw these I was like, “Wow, they’re very pretty but will
they look good on everybody?” I guess we are about to try them out.
We are gonna swatch them. Now, you do get this bundle for $45,
which I think is a great retail price considering each individual shade is basically
$11.25, which I think is very fair, and you do get all of them together. So, besides that you guys, I know everyone
likes to talk about different weight of everything. These are 0.11 oz each, which
that’s pretty good for a product. It’s not like, “Oh my God, it’s empty”.
You get like 10 swatches out of these. So what I’ve heard and seen online is it’s
basically like a normal lipstick, of course, like a stick lipstick but basically
in a liquid form. So, this formula is not supposed to be long-lasting.
It is not supposed to be kiss-proof, and it is not supposed to dry down completely
matte. Like matte, like her previous lip kits. It is a completely different formula.
So, let’s get that out of the way. And I think it is time to swatch. Now, the shade names…I’ve seen
so many people have thoughts on them. I’m like, “Girl, it’s a lipstick name.” So, from here to here it is Kimberly,
Kim, Kiki and Kimmie. Now, are those the most
creative names? No. But it’s cute, it’s personal, it’s her
collaboration, and those are all her nicknames that her family and
friends call her I’m sure every day. So, I think it is really cute. Say what
you want. It’s a fucking lipstick name. Relax, girl. All right. First shade we are going
to swatch is shade Kimberly. Now, because they are frosted, I don’t
really wanna guess what the colors are. This obviously looks like a pale, tan nude.
Now, you guys know how I like to see it. Okay, there’s the virgin wand.
Ooh, the dove foot is small and cute. And you guys know I’m all about
fragrance and… oh, wait a minute. There’s literally like no fragrance.
Holy shit. It’s almost non-existent, which I kind of love that, because
I am not always into fragrances. Okay, let’s put this on
and see what happens. Okay. There is one application,
or one dip as I like to call it. Now, of course I have slightly bigger
lips than the average whore, so it does take a little bit more
product for me to put on. Now, I did notice one thing
that was kind of weird. When I was applying it straight on,
it was a little streaky. But then when I flipped the dove foot,
it felt like more of it came off onto my mouth, which is kind of strange to me
but, hey. It’s on there. All right. Here is one layer so far. Let me really zoom in with my eyes
and see what is going here. It’s almost like a gloss to me.
Like a colored gloss. Almost like a lip stain or something.
It’s definitely pretty, non-sticky. It is very like lightweight, which I love.
I hate things that stick to your hair or mouth, or like when your lips get all....
This one is very smooth. I will say that. I do wanna dunk in and just kind of do
one more layer. It isn’t as full coverage. I mean it’s cute. I like it. But I think
I wanna do a little bit more just to see what it looks like on. But it really
did cover everything. It is a tiny bit streaky but it does
have like that kind of gloss effect, so that’s kind of what I was expecting.
But let me put on a little bit more. To me the second layer didn’t like
do anything mind-blowing. I think it definitely looks a little bit better.
And the color is very pretty, especially I think with my really light,
warm makeup. It definitely is complementing it. So, a lot of people are probably gonna
ask me like, “Do these come off easy?” Now, they are supposed to be like normal lipsticks,
so I’m just gonna take a clean finger and go like this. Oh, yeah. Like all of it came off,
really. It says it’s not long-lasting, so obviously that’s exactly what it means.
All right. Let’s swatch the next color. All right. The next shade we’re going to try
is called Kim. And in the bottle it almost looks like a peachy, light nude.
I guess we will see in five seconds. Okay, I will say this. For some reason, this shade is a little
bit more streaky than the first one. It’s not like horrible or anything. It’s just
like I’m having to apply a little bit more. Now, I will say this. Peachy colors
are harder to make. I feel like with brands, they’re always
a little more streaky. To me this almost seems like a gloss lip color.
Almost like the Anastacia…like glosses. Okay. So, this one is on. I actually
love the color. It is really pretty. It goes with my, of course,
hair and my little eye look I did. The same thing as the other one.
It is very lightweight. I think it’s pretty. It doesn’t feel like anything on my mouth,
which I appreciate ‘cause I do not want a heavy-ass lipstick on my mouth all day.
Who the hell does? Let’s try the third one. All right. Third shade we’re going
to try is called Kiki and…I don’t even know what this looks like.
It looks like another like a pale, nudish color . A little more on the peachy side, versus Kimberly,
which was the first one we swatched. So, they’re a little different. This one looks
a lot more like a warm rosy, maybe? I don’t know. I guess we’re gonna
see in a second. Now, I will say this. How many lip swatches have
I done on my channel? Normally it takes so long in between
swatches to like remove. This removes like a normal lipstick.
Very easy. So, let’s try Kiki. I’m just gonna say it.
Right off the bat, this shade is probably my favourite
so far out of the three. It’s actually more opaque than the first two.
I don’t know why that is with the formula. But this went on very easy. I mean the other ones
were easy but this one was like extra easy. Like I think more opaque than the other two.
I mean you guys are watching this. You’ll have to be the judge and tell me.
But this went on like really smooth. I think it is really pretty. I love the warm
tone nude. It is stunning. Same thing, consistency, everything is literally
the same besides the coverage in my opinion. Let’s try the fourth one. The fourth shade
is called Kimmie. It is of course another nude. This one looks like…I don’t even know
what it looks like, you guys. They all…they kind of look similar. Obviously
they’re not the same but when you put them all next to each other, they are very similar.
Let’s see what Kimmie looks like on the mouth. All right. Here is Kimmie on the lips. I definitely think that it is the darkest
color in the collection. It’s a little more corally. It almost looks
brownish nude in here. Not crazy. And then you put it on and it’s like, oh!
It has like a little more orange to it, which I don’t mind. I don’t love the color
for me specifically with pink hair, pink everything. It’s cute, just not
really my cup of tea. All right, now I know you guys are all gonna
ask me how long these lipsticks actually last. I know we did a finger test but
I thought why not do the kiss test. So today, babe, we are trying out
the new Kim K-Kylie liquid lipsticks. They’re more like a normal
like stick lipstick but in a… Says cream. Cream form, I guess. Yeah. So, I’m just gonna kiss you once to see
how like quickly these come off for everyone at home
that’s gonna be asking. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You can wipe that off. I mean it’s still
kind of on my mouth, though. This was the darker shade. Oh, yeah,
it’s really on. That top lip is doomed. Let me try one more. Okay. Sorry. It comes off. Yeah. So… Like I can feel it on my mouth.
I feel like I have lipstick on, though. Oh, really? Well, you do. Yeah. All right. Thanks, babe. I think it’s time to give
my final thoughts. All right, guys. As you saw, the kiss
test definitely removed a lot of it. So, I layered the shade Kiki over what was
remaining. So this is the shade that you get. I love that shade. I think Kiki is
my favorite of the four. But…okay. So, final thoughts are these
are normal lispticks. Now I think…listen, $45 for all of them
is literally $11.25 per lipstick which I think is very fair for her brand and her
price point. I do wish that they were available individually. Not everybody
is going to want all four, of course. And I do want to say one thing.
I’m a little shocked that…no, I get it. They are “nude” lipsticks. Now,
there’s always huge debates online. What is a “nude”? Obviously,
there are a huge range of skin tones and I don’t necessarily think that
these are nudes for everybody. I don’t think that medium to dark skin tones
are really gonna be able to wear these or look flattering. You’re definitely
gonna have to use a darker lip liner if you are more of the caramel
skin, or even darker. I don’t see these being pulled off
by anyone that is I guess in that range. I definitely think they should have
thrown in a few darker nudes or maybe even extended the collection
to maybe like five, six, seven, eight, and had done like eight nudes
because…I don’t know. I just personally don’t think these are going
to look flattering on every single person. I do think that they looked very pretty.
Now, let’s get to the formula. Now, the formula was…it’s pretty basic.
There’s nothing mind-blowing. I definitely think that, for me, I am
a more long-lasting type of bitch. I do not want something where I eat
or drink and I have to reapply. But a lot of people don’t like long-lasting.
They do not like that matte feel. They don’t like having to remove it
at night and it takes extra time. So, if you are somebody that is just on the go,
you wanna throw something on, I think that these are perfect.
I think their price point is pretty easy. If you just want to try them out
and see if they’re for you, I think that this is a good time because
they’re not, you know, an expensive item. If you don’t wanna get all four,
I don’t know what to say. I’m sure they’re gonna bring them
back individually after this launch. You know how they do that sometimes.
And of course, everyone keeps talking about it. This came with a card that says,
“I have a surprise coming soon.” Which Kim wrote this, by the way.
So I’m sure they’re gonna add to the collection. Maybe Kim is gonna do
her own makeup line. That’s honestly what I think, or so. Let’s pray that Kim does her own brand
because I bet on her own it will be sickening. So, I’m gonna pray for that, Kim.
Don’t try me. you better come up with
your own fucking line But besides that, you guys, I am going
to say that these are Jeffrey star-approved. Now, notice how there’s not a lot
of cheering and screaming. I just don’t think that the formula is that
mind-blowing. I think it is very basic. I don’t wanna say there’s nothing
special about the collab. I think the packaging, the name…
you’re obviously paying for Kim and Kylie’s name. The packaging like I said in the intro
was beautiful and I love the aesthetics. So, if you’re a lipstick lover and a collector
you should definitely get this. But if you’re not really impressed,
skip it and move on to the next thing. Okay, while I was filming this, you guys, I got…no, I did order this
with my own money. Kim K’s new lighters.
They are the Kimoji lighters. Can we show middle fingers
without being flagged? Don’t get age-restricted.
I might have to block this! But these lighters are so cute. Can we talk about this, though?
The tie-dye crying? I live. But…all right, you guys.
Thank you so much for watching. And I’ll see you on the next one. 
What’s up, everybody.
Welcome back to my channel. Today we are going to be diving into some
luxury items from the brand, Givenchy Beauty,  which I haven’t really used a lot of
their stuff on my channel before. It is, of course, a high end brand.  I love Givenchy Fashion. I love their clothing, their shoes,
their sunglasses. So, today we’re going to be talking about
some new items that Givenchy just dropped. Now they have a beauty line and
 a while ago, which is weird, because I was just thinking here like, okay,
we’re going to try out some stuff today, but I bought this primer from them,
it’s called, Mister Mat,  so I thought it would be a good idea to bust
this out and try it with their foundation.  I’m sure that would probably
be the best bet. First of all, we are going to talk
 about their new beauty sponge.  It is a spiked beauty sponge
and it looks something like this. Oh my God, why does this
look like a deadly weapon? And I’m kind of obsessed with it. So, this is soaked with water already.
And I’m kind of obsessed with it. So, this is soaked with water already. I do have another one here. So, it comes in a box that
looks something like this. Now, these retail for $20. I think that’s pretty fair. Beauty blenders are, I think,
around the same price. Now, you guys know, on my channel I always
 do wet beauty blenders with setting powder and it just looks amazing so
I may try this wet, I don’t know. It does look like this when it is dry. So, it does double in size. Now, I am going to go on Sephora.com
which is where I found this. So, basically you guys, this is a multi-use sponge
 applicator for smooth even coverage. We’ll see about that in a second. And it says that this can be used damp with
fluid foundations or dry with a compact. A new double cone shape ensures quick and precise
 application, while its central strip keeps fingers clean.  Now, when I read that, I was like,
thank you Lord.  Now, you guys know I’m a beauty
blender whore, but I’ve got to say this,  when I am gripping a beauty blender
and the foundation gets all over my nails, it is annoying because then I have to go in with a make-up
 wipe and wipe it all off or I have to wash my hands, and it does get a little bit of, you
know, it’s a little bit annoying. It’s a little bit of an annoyingnance,
annoying, I’m annoyed, okay? That’s what’s happening. Now the texture, compared to this,
is very similar. Now, today we’re also going to be
testing out their brand new foundation. It comes in a unit carton
that looks like this. And this is, oh my God, you guys know,
 I’m going to pronounce this wrong,  I pronounce everything that
I don’t know how to say, wrong. How about we just zoom in
on that word, everybody? Matissime, Matissima, Mat, oh my God. This brand is going to slap me across
 my mouth if they’re ever watching this. Basically, this is a new matte velvet foundation
and I’m going to tell you guys some facts about it. So, this foundation comes
at a whopping $54 which, that’s not that bad compared
 to a lot of my favorite foundations. But the bottle looks something like this. It has this beautiful kind of like studded detailing
right there, with the shiny black packaging. This is glass, so of course, I know you guys cannot
feel how heavy this is through the phones or the computers but it feels nice. It also has SPF20 in it which is nice,
you all know I’m not trying to age. This foundation was inspired by the feel and
comfort of velvet that's straight from the runway. I love that. It is sheer
to medium coverage. Now, it is for normal and c
ombination skin only. Well, that’s what it says on Sephora.com, obviously
I’m sure the brand provided that information. So, basically you guys, this is going to give
your complexion an instantly long-lasting hold while keeping your skin balanced
and allowing it to breathe. Dual mattifying technology instantly
imparts a matte effect. The airy structure of silica microspheres
optimizes the absorption of excess moisture while allowing the skin to breathe. Oh my God, okay scientists,
how the fuck did you do that?  And basically it says that it’s going to
give my skin a lasting matte effect, while a botanical trio targets oily areas without
drying-out the normal and dry areas of the skin. Jesus, take the wheel. So basically, this is a bad-ass foundation,
allegedly, and we’re about to test out these today. Also they have a bronzer that they just
put out and we’ll talk about that later. But let’s get our engines ready
and let’s do our first impressions. Alright, I am going to go in with
their Mister Mat primer.  Let’s see what this looks like,
I don’t even know. Oh! Whoa! It’s like, it almost feels like the Benefit
POREfessional, like almost identical actually.  Okay, it has more of
a strong floral scent. The one like Benefit is definitely like
no fragrance, which I kind of prefer.  If it’s not a yummy scent I’m not into it. In a video a few days ago I said that I didn’t
love fragrances, but I like fragrances, and so many of you were
trying to read me down.  I simply meant I don’t like really
strong fragrances in make-up, but if it’s a pleasant scent like sugar or anything
sweet, I’m into it, just not overpowering.  Okay, so it definitely mattified my face. My pores look a little more flat. Did they cover them up
completely and blurred? No. Which, this did not say it was
supposed to blur. It definitely did not. But it did mattify my skin, which I expected it
to do and I guess it did the job. Okay, I’m going to let that settle for
a second and let’s try this foundation. I think I’m going to go in
with 04 Mat Beige. The number 03 was a little light for me, which
 I’m shocked, because I’m a pale-ass bitch. So, it says on the side of the bottle
to shake well before use. So, we’re going to shake
her up right now. Alright. Alright. Okay, so the pump, of course,
is a standard pump like this.  Now, when I tweeted and said that I was going to review
 this a lot of you were excited and said, yes, please do it. Now, you also said that this looks like the Maybelline
SuperStay Better Skin Foundation, and I actually have that and I pulled
that out of my ass earlier.  I haven’t used it in months,
but it kind of looks similar, huh? No tint, no shade, just kind of
similar bottles and pumps. But okay, so we have our wet
sponge, it is ready to go.  I’m just going to put out a few
pumps on the blender like that. I like to dot it around my face, so let’s
 do that and then we’re going to blend it. Okay, you guys know I am a full coverage queen and
this of course did say sheer to medium coverage, and it’s definitely that. Like, I’m already like, I want
a little bit more coverage. Am I judging. Okay, now I’m going to maybe
flip it and just kind of go in. Oh yeah, this is really good
for like right here. A lot easier than using my nails
and the tip of the other sponge. Okay, so I’m looking in the monitor and for
some reason I’m looking a little patchy, which is very bizarre
with a beauty sponge. Now, here’s a thing, does the
primer work well with the foundation? I don’t know. It’s obviously from the
same brand so I’m going to assume, but sometimes you guys, formulas do not mix well
 with primer so I’m not blaming the primer yet. But, it is a little streaky. And it could be the sponge, maybe it’s
not applying as well as I wanted it to. It’s funny because I said the material
was very similar to the beauty blender, but the beauty blender just feels
more soft while it’s buffing. Almost this shape, I don’t know. I’m like,
I’m a little conflicted right now to be honest. Let’s get her to a medium because
right now it is very sheer. So I’m going to take it on this side now
and let’s do one, I’ll do one pump. And let’s use this side
and see what happens. Okay. Now, I’m looking in the monitor and
I’m looking in the mirror, it is blotchy. Like, are you guys seeing
what I’m seeing? This is such a trip.  I almost want to take a Artis brush
and see if it will like fix any of this. I want to show a little close-up
of like this area on my face. Because I obviously just blended out the forehead
but this, it’s almost like kind of spotty. Like, kind of coagulated right there,
a little bit right here. Now I’m going to just take this brush and blend up
 and out and see if it will smooth it out a little more. Okay everybody, I think this
brush definitely helped. So, this from applying make-up
literally every day for so long, I’m sitting here and I’m like, okay, I’m like,
I know how to troubleshoot make-up, I think I know what’s going on. So, I think the sponge is not great. Just for me. It may be amazing
for other people.  But the material and the way
it goes on, the way it’s angled,  it’s like hard to like, I don’t know,
it’s like a thinner spot, it’s not like bigger where it’s getting
a larger portion of my face. I felt like the foundation was drying quickly
and this was not helping move it around. It was almost like stamping it around instead
of making it like look airbrushed and beautiful. Now, the foundation itself,
I think is actually pretty. Now, the primer, who knows what the fuck
the primer did to the foundation,  but the foundation itself
is really pretty. Yes, it’s very sheer, we did build it up, but as you can
see, you know, I do have a little bit of discoloration and it barely covered it,
but it’s very natural. And I know a lot of people out
 there love natural foundations. You know I’m not one of them
but I’m down to try them all out. Now, I do want to put on some concealer and
powder and see how the foundation looks. Now, I think it’s only fair that we use this,
of course, because that’s why we’re here. So, today for concealer, I’m going to be
going in with the Tarte Shape Tape. Now, I know how this looks on me,
 I’ve been using it for months now. So, we are going to just dot this all
over where I would normally put it. Alrighty, now, let’s bust her out again. And let’s buff out and
let’s see what happens. Okay, let’s zoom in here, because this,
I think, is what fucked up the foundation. So, I took the tip, just like they said, I went in
and it just does not want to blend like amazing. Oh yeah, it’s like almost just moving it around
and not making it look flawless, I guess. This is what I have to say about that. Whoever’s been watching my channel
for a while, or even a few videos, you know how my concealer
blends out like fucking butter.  This is rough. Oh my God, it’s like a little dry
under my eyes now too. Well, I am going to quickly buff this out with
 this because I am fucking shook right now. There we go.  Now, let’s show the difference
between this side, which in my opinion, because I’m staring at myself five
inches away, looks smooth, flawless and beautiful. And then let’s go over here
where it’s just not happening. There’s less coverage, it’s streaky, there’s
 like concealer that’s pulled from right here, there’s like a dry patch. I’m like,
what the fuck man. I’m like not used to seeing that result,
so I’m a little shocked right now.  I’m just going to keep it really
 on one hundred as usual. Okay, I think it’s only fair that we take some
under-eye setting powder like we would normally do. We’ll take the Chanel,
one of my all time favorites. We’ll use this guy again. And we’re just going to dip in like I normally would
and let’s see how it works under the eyes.  I mean, it’s loose powder, right? You can’t really mess that up. Alright guys, so I quickly did a little bit more
 setting on my face and I put powder foundation. Today I used the Chanel Double
Perfection Lumière Powder Foundation. I love this one, I’ve been using
it for a long time now on and off. I’m going to give you my first
impressions on the sponge. Of course, I’m going to wear the foundation for
about six hours and come back in a little bit. But I’m going to say this to you guys right off
the bat, I love this brand and I hate doing this, But, girl, that sponge is awful. I knew it. I should have just stayed
to my tried and true beauty blender. But I saw the packaging.
Packaging lures you in, it really does.  It looked amazing, I loved the shape,
I loved how it looked. It just didn’t work. I think it was the material and maybe the shape
should have been a little bigger when it was wet. I did not love it, sadly.  So, sadly, the blender is not
Jeffree Starr approved. The foundation, so far, is looking good. It’s pretty. But I also wanted to do a little
mini review. Sneak this in here. Givenchy also put out a new Floral
Edition of their Healthy Glow Powder. It comes in a giant compact like this. You all know I like giant things. Big things, tall things, fat,
luscious, juicy things. No, I’m not talking about
Nathan’s ball sack. But, today we are going
to try this out. Let’s open her up. Ooh bitch! I love pans that have
decorations in it. I love the imprints in the powder. I love that type of stuff. And this looks stunning. This bronzer is a whopping $65,
so it’s even more than the foundation. Good Lord! So, we’re going to test this out y’all,
 I’m going to put it on my face. Now, I’m really not a bronzy person, obviously
 you guys know, I’m not really into that.  Lately I have been more into the
sun-kissed look but I’m trying new things. Now, this is a Healthy Glow
and Body Bronzing Powder. It is supposed to be weightless
for a healthy looking appearance,  featuring a powder design with
a symmetry, floral impression. Yes, I see it and I’m obsessed with it.  It also says that it is a talc-free powder that lets
 your skin show off in its best light year round, while always looking
fresh and radiant. Formulated with innovative technology,
it is, what does it say y’all? It’s supposed to reinvent
the nude makeup look. Thanks to a formula that provides color
 without texture, which, I love that, because some highlighters and some bronzers,
it makes your pores stand out and not cute. So, I figured we’d go in with this little Marc Jacobs…
little… big Marc Jacobs Bronzer Brush.  I don’t want to ruin it, I might have to buy another one.  Okay, we’re going in. No fragrance, you guys know
I like to smell everything. Okay, so I don’t really
do this type of thing. I know I see people that just cover themselves
with bronzer. I’m just going to go in on myself. Let’s see what happens. Now, I will say this, when I saw the color in the pan,
I was like, ooh, it’s a little warm tone for me. It’s a little orange. But when it’s on the skin right
now, it’s not like severe or gnarly.  It’s like, hmm. I like how the flowers
don’t really get messed up right away, which means it’s not like, you know, you’re
not going to go through it in a few weeks. It’s definitely… it’s definitely doing the job. I think the foundation got
a little patchy up here. I mean, let’s keep it real with each
other, okay, it’s a little patchy. Now, that is very uncommon on
 this channel, I’m sorry to say. But yeah, it’s a little patchy up here. So the bronzer might look
a little weird on top of it. I think the reason why, is I was expecting
it to be really orange and wild and it’s not. It’s really pretty. It is definitely sheer,
which I like in a bronzer, because I don’t want something that is like really
intense where all of a sudden your face looks like you just threw mud on all on top of it. Okay guys, I think I am going
to finish my make-up. And I am going to go to the office,
I’m going to go run some errands. And yeah, I’m going to be back
way later in the day. You guys are going to be watching this
in the same video but I will be back later tonight. Alright y’all. Look at me. I’m having
like a 70’s moment. Okay, so basically, heavy glasses
fuck up the nose. So anyway, final thoughts. It’s been about… let me look at
my phone, my God, it’s late today. It has been about 6 hours, and
45 minutes actually, to be exact.  And I’m going to give you my final
 thoughts on all three products. Let’s start with the make-up sponge. I picked it up off the floor and I said,
 “I’m sorry, bitch, I’m not into you.” This one definitely fucked up
my foundation. It did not blend out the concealer amazing. I don’t know why. I am just going to guess from someone
who has used so many sponges, that the material of the sponge was not it. This surface needs to be wider. It just did not distribute the product
good enough for me. Definitely made it patchy. When your boyfriend can notice that your make-up is
 different on one side, we have some problems, honey. So, the blender… Next. Alright, so the foundation, is actually,
it surprised me. Throughout the day
it really did not move. It’s subtle, it’s cute. It’s very like almost like fresh looking,
I guess is really the right word. It’s youthful, it did not crack or
get weird, which is shocking. I touched up my T-zone probably like,
yeah, literally once today in the car in traffic. Yeah, the foundation’s really pretty. I think for the price, there are definitely some
drugstore options that you can find that are similar. But if you are someone that loves luxury
 items and you love a pretty matte look, this foundation is definitely
a candidate for you. So, the Givenchy matte foundation
is Jeffree Starr approved. Yay! Now, let’s move on to the bronzer. I think that the bronzer
was really pretty. I’m excited to use it, take it on
some trips, keep my glow. I definitely can’t wait to try it when my foundation
 is not so patchy and it’s put on correctly. I don’t know, I’m not really into
the more matte primers. I like fresh, more, I mean,
I don’t know. I think this may have been an issue
with the foundation as well, I’m not sure. I’m going to try the foundation at a further date
this week, without this and without the blender, and I will give you some feedback
below with a little update. So, the bronzer, the bronzer
is Jeffree Star approved. I loved it. It was really pretty, it went on great,
the formula was nice and blended very pretty. How many times am
I going to say pretty? The bronzer’s pretty, okay?  It’s pretty.  And I loved it. So, cool. Two out of three ain’t bad y’all.  Two out of three is not bad.  Let me know your guys’ thoughts on
how the foundation looked on my skin. Let me know what you thought on
the blender close-up, in that 4K, baby. And I will see you guys
on the next video. Thank you so much for watching. Mwah! Love you guys.

What’s up everybody.
Welcome back to my channel. Today I have a really exciting
tutorial because… listen... the Manny MUA - Jeffree Star cosmetics
collaboration has finally been revealed today. It has been so hard to keep it
a secret from you guys. I know that me and Manny have been sneak
peaking on Instagram the last few weeks, but we have been working on this idea
for months now and it’s so just cool and amazing to see all come
to fruitation and come together. Now, the collaboration… bam, looks a little
something like this and this is the bundle box. Now, the bundle comes at an amazing discount,
for only 50 bucks you get two velour liquid lipsticks and one skin frost. Now, me and Manny
created these shades together. He really… I, mean I think he kinda stepped
out of his comfort zone a lot for this one because we all know Manny
loves his nude lipsticks, but he definitely went a little more, errt, for this one,
which I love because he has done a lot of collaborations in the past and I think it was cool for him
to do something a little different. So, in today’s tutorial I will be using the highlighter
and of course one of the liquid lips. If you have not seen the other
color or seen the full reveal you can watch that right now on Mannyʻs channel
and everything will be linked down below. Now, the collaboration will be out April 8th… wooo!
Which is only a few weeks away. I can’t even believe it. I’m like, “Oh my god, it’s approaching!” And of course, also, everything in
here will be sold individually. So, if you don’t want the bundle and you just want one lipstick or
maybe you just want the highlighter, you of course can get that. I also have something really exciting to share with
my UK and Europe customers and subscribers; me and Manny are doing
a little UK tour, if you will. Where we’ll gonna do some Meet and Greets,
we’re gonna have a Pop-up Store. And, we are doing Manchester,
Liverpool and London. So, also, everything will be linked down below if
you forget or need any reminders, need any links. But, me and Manny cannot wait
to see everyone in the UK. So, I think itʻs time to dive into this look. So, if you want to see how I created this high fashion
military green glam, then keep on watching. Alright guys, let’s dive into this tutorial. So, today to prep the skin I’m gonna be using
the new Farsali Unicorn Essence Serum. Oh, my god! Now, I know a lot of you love me to read me the filth
for using this expensive ass primer in all of my videos. So, if you kind of want… I’m not gonna say this is
a dupe, but a similar affect is definitely this one and it is I think 60 percent cheaper. And, I also use this on Zach for the I do my Boyfriend’s
Brother’s Makeup Tag and his skin looked snatched. So, we’re just gonna give this guy a little shake. So, I’m just going to put some on my skin. Iʻm crying cotton candy. If you ever wondered what it looked like for me to be
in a bococki, here is what Iʻd be looking like. Cute, this looks really interesting.
Looks like a unicorn gang bang. Alright, now I’m gonna take a little
synthetic brush and put this all over; you can also use your hands, of course, but a lot of times with
jewelry and nails I donʻt like to get products on my hands. So, thank god for brushes. Alright, my skin is feeling really nice
and almost like tacky, which I love because I already know the makeup
is going to melt on my skin. So, let’s get the foundation; for foundation,
we are going to use two today. We’re gonna use a little drug store and a little luxury and
kind of mix them together for a little cocktail if you will. So, I’m first gonna go in with the Dior Airflash; this has been
one of my favorite foundations for I think almost five years now. That’s a long time, because with
makeup I get over things. There’s so much product coming out,
always, from so many brands. But this one though, this one, probably one
of the best foundation formulas I’ve ever tried. Now, it doesn’t have to be perfect
because you are going to blend it out. So, I just kind of like to get a fine mist
around my whole entire face if you will. And then, we’re gonna go in with the L’Oréal
Infallible Pro-Glow Foundation; let’s get to buffing. Alright, now for a concealer today, we’re going to be going in
with the Make Up Forever Ultra HD Concealer. This is the invisible cover. Now, a few people have done my makeup recently
for photoshoots and they’ve used this on me and I felt like it looked really brightening
and really snatch. So, let’s give this a whirl. I don’t wanna put on too much because I don’t know the coverage
really for this, cause someone else used this on me. Come on baby. There we go. So, I’m just gonna do a little bit and then
we can always add more if we need to. Come on hair, get the fuck back. Alright, now time to buff and blend this out. Besides my Beauty Blender, I’m also going to be using
the Artis Oval 7 brush for a little bit of blending today. So, we’re gonna use both of them. Alright, now this concealer
is so fuckin full coverage. Now, I know I don’t normally use
cream contours a lot on my channel, but I am going to be going in with
the Laura Mercier… what is this one? The Flawless Contouring Palette. I’ve been using this for a year
now, on and off.... I love it. And, I’m gonna go in, of course, with a synthetic
bristle brush so it doesn’t fuck up my nice ones. And I’m gonna go in with the shade Contour 1
and I’m just gonna put a little bit on my brush and I like to kind of sculpt to contour out. And, we’re just gonna stop it
there; not do anything too low. And then, do a little bit into the hair line. When you wanna make your forehead
invisible, use some heavy contouring. Alright, now it is time to blend this out
because we look a little crazy right now. Alright, contour is almost done; now
we’re about to set it with a little bronzer. But before that we gotta make sure
our under eyes are not gonna crease. So, I’m going to be going in with the La Mer
powder because you know this shit’s bomb. Alright, now I’m gonna take a clean brush; it can be any brush you want and we’re just
going to brush away all that loose powder. Now, we’re gonna use the new Tom Ford
Ultimate Bronzer in shade Terra, Tara, Terra. Look how big this compact.
Oh, what’s up androgyny palette? What’s up bitch? Hey girl, hey!
No, but for real, this new bronzer though, I used it the other day and it’s everything. So, I’m going to just kind of
go over that cream contour. It’s almost like we’re setting it,
so you don’t want to go really heavy. You’re just gonna be kind of really
light-handed and just kind of brush it on. Alright, the face is set. So now, I’m going to quickly
do some eye brows off camera and I’ll be right back. Alright, for eyes today we’re going to be dipping into both
of my palettes; the Beauty Killer and the Androgyny palette. Now, today we’re only gonna
be using one shade in here. It’s really to just kind of set my entire
eye for a nice ivory base. And, of course we’re gonna
be using shade China White. So, I’m gonna take a little MAC 252 brush; I’ve been
using these for 10 years, I am obsessed with them and let’s go in on the eye. Let’s dip into the Androgyny palette. Now, oh my god. So, I’ve been using this one
for a minute; the stars are getting diminished. So, I’m going to be taking this little
Bobbi Brown Eye Blender brush and we are going to dip right into Safe Word for
the little transition shade if you will. So, let’s get on it. And then to make sure those lines are really blended
nicely; I’m going to go in with this Morphe M510. Now, normally I use this to highlight,
but I love dipping this into China White and just getting the brush coated in that ivory
shadow and I’ll just kind of go over this. And, just make sure it’s really blended out nice. Now that Safe Word is all set and laid,
it’s time to move on to some green. So, I’m first gonna start off by packing the shade Military,
which is this green color right here, all over the lid and also in the crease.
So, let’s get to it. Alright, now we’re gonna dip into Military again and
we’re just gonna start smoking out the under eye. So, I’m just going to take this little dome brush
and just kind of look up and start blending. Now, for liner today I’m gonna be using
something I actually never used before. This is from the brand Marc Jacobs Beauty. And these are the Highliner Matte Gel Eye
Crayons and this is in shade Deja Blue. Now, oh, I mean it’s such
a pretty periwinkle color. I’ve seen Manny use this before in a few tutorials and
I was like, “Oh, okay bitch you water line is like snatched.” We are going to try this bad boy out today. And, these are supposed to last like a
long time and not smear or come off. So, let’s see what happens. I mean, hello pigment!  Holy shit. It even got on my lashes which is fine because
we’re gonna do mascara in a minute, but like damn! Holy shit. The water line so like,
I’m taking it back, it looks so pretty. So, now we’re going to dip into shade
Poison, it is a really dark teal color. And we’re going to be using
this little Cozzette brush. And what we’re about to do is take the color
and do it under the water line color. So, we’re just kind of go back and forth
really gently and darken that smoky eye. Now, we’re gonna use this same brush
and dip into Military, one more time. And, we’re just gonna lightly put that over
Poison and then just kind of buff it out. It looks seamless and really dramatic. Alright, now let’s add a little bit
of glitter and spice to this look. Now, I know I have used these Stella liquid eye shadows
a million times on my channel the last few months and they’re in my favorites. I am obsessed with them. Now, this shade Diamond Dust, almost gives
you like a holographic effect on the lid. Yes, all my holo-sexuals out there what it is. Now, you guys tell me if it looks holographic or not,
but I just think that this glitter though is everything. Now, you can use a synthetic brush if you
want; I’m going in with the applicator. And, I’ll start going really,
really barely any. Just kind of light to start. And then,
we’re going to paint the entire lid. And, I love this brush cause it kind of helps you
carve out your lid where you want to stop the glitter. Now, the trick with these you guys,
is to do it last for your eyes. So, before lashes and mascara,
put the glitter on. If you try to put the glitter on too early and blend it
out with the brush it will kind of fall on your cheeks. So, it has to be the last topper for your eye. Alright, of course, no shocker here I’m going to be
going in with my favorite Benefit Roller Lash mascara. Now, a few weeks ago I tried another
mascara in a tutorial and didn’t love it. So, here we are. Alright, now to make sure there’s no liner on our lashes I’m
going to try and cover them all with, of course the mascara. So, let’s see what happens. For lashes, today I’m going to be going in
with the Lilly Ghalichi Lashes in style Delara. And I will be right back. Alright now, let’s get to highlighting
and the lips and so of course, I’m going to be using the Manny MUA
Jeffery Star Cosmetics bundle box today. Yes. In the box… bam, you get one
Skin Frost and two liquid lips. So, of course, if you want to see the full reveal head on
over to Manny’s channel, it will be linked down below. But, today I’m going to be using one lip
and of course the highlighter. I gotta bath in that mother
fucker right now. The highlighter color is called Eclipse and of course if comes in the Manny MUA matte
black packaging with his classic hologram. And, when you open it up… whoh…
you get the crescent moon and the star. Now, I’ve been using this for the last few weeks so, I’m just
gonna do a little one, two, three and let’s get to highlighting. Now, when Manny and I were creating this shade he was
like, “Look, I want something really like icy, peachy. Like just something so blinding that
will just you know, steal your soul.” And, he created this shade in the lab
with me and I was like obsessed. And, I love how it looks on his skin tone, it just kind of like transforms on everyone
and I think it looks so stunning and I’m just really happy of just
how this whole thing turned out. I’m like, “Oh!”  You guys know this bitch
is going to blind for filth right now. Alright, now we are going to hit
our cupid’s bow of course. And, when I say hit the cupid’s bow,
I mean, slay. And, of course last but not least,
it is the brow bone. So, I’m going to take this little Tom Ford
angle brush and we’re just going to take that and put it right under the brow. Just so that it kind of gives it a little
added dimension and flavor. Alright, now I quickly wanna through on some blush, so I’m
going to be using the BECCA Cosmetics Flowerchild blush. This is in the Prosecco Pop split.
I love this color. It is just really… I don’t know you
guys will see when it hits the cheek. It’s really pretty.
And these are really pigmented, so when it’s on the brush,
do a little tap because Lord Jesus. For lips today, of course, you guys know I’m gonna be using
one of the Manny MUA JSC collaboration velour liquid lipsticks. And, I’m going to be going in
with shade Daddy. This is a really cool tone,
90’s brown. I love it. I think that it is very Manny. Now, I know he likes to stick to his light
nude shades, but I feel like this is just him. It like speaks to me. I feel like…
I don’t know, when I look at this color I like… I kind of like Manny
would wear that instantly. But, I think that this will go really nice with
this cool tone look today. So, let’s put it on. The lip is dry. I think it looks so beautiful with this look. I’m looking in the monitor like… Hi! Okay, now of course it’s time to set the face. Now since this is black packaging I’m had to pull out the new Tatcha Luminous Dewy
Skin Mist in this limited edition black packaging. It is so beautiful. And of course, you guys
know we have to give it a little shake. And, this is going to make your
skin even a little extra glowy. So, if you’re afraid of the glow, put this
down and grab your normal setting spray. But, if you’re afraid of the glow,
how do you even get to my channel? Let’s get our engines ready. There we go, she’s new.
She needed to get a little worked up. She had to get a little pumped. Alright, let’s set. Alright, this look is complete. Alright, I hope you guys enjoyed today’s tutorial,
of course, using the Manny MUA JSC Collaboration. Now, that drops on April 8th,
which is about two weeks away. I can’t even believe it, I’m like… I’m so nervous,
anxious and excited for you guys to get everything and try them on yourselves. I cannot wait to see everyone
glow to filth all summer long. Alright guys, thank you so much for watching
this video and I’ll see you in the next one. Bye, guys. 
Whats up everybody,
welcome
back to my channel. Now, today we’re gonna be diving into
the new Wet N Wild Unicorn Glow box. And today we have a whole,
little yummy box to try out. Now, there’s a lot of stuff in here, which we’re going to be talking
about in a second, but I know recently there has been so much
drama about unicorn inspired makeup and here’s the thing.
“Here’s the real T.” Make-up has had trends come and go throughout
the years; everything from, you know, only people wanting nude lips to now
this crazy holographic trend to now, unicorn inspired make-up brushes,
highlighters, lipsticks, lip glosses. I mean, look, so many
brands have done it now and I know there was some
drama a few weeks ago. If you want to even hear about all that,
I’m gonna spare you guys, cause this is my channel
and
we’re gonna just keep it moving. But I do wanna reference that, hey look, at the end of the day,
make-up is make-up and, if 20 brands wanna come out with
brushes of the unicorn horn handles, it’s a trend, I mean people want it,
customers want it, and if you can’t afford
a high end collection, you may be able to afford
the drug store collection. So I think, it’s cool that so many
people are diving into the unicorn realm,
and at the end of the day, let’s rewind all the way
to the 90’s to Lisa Frank. Anyone wanna do a quick
Google search on her, because she was the queen of unicorns and
pop art and anything kitschy and fun like that. So now, Wet N Wild has put out
this amazing Unicorn Glow Box, and I have something exciting to tell you,
that I just found out myself, starting May 21st, Wet N Wild, the whole
entire brand will be available on ulta.com. I don’t know if it’s
gonna be in stores. I am praying, but it will be available on the website
and I think that that's so cool. The Ulta is just like eating everyone up
and they just got cover effects and now they've got Wet N Wild. So, now before we dive
into this first impressions, I do wanna say that for the second time
I’m doing a giveaway in today’s video. I know I did one on my Ulta Haul,

if you win, so you will know. Alright! If you wanna see me play
with some unicorn crazy shit, then keep on watching. So in this beautiful box, which will be
for sale, I think as a whole, you get... ooh, it’s a big box. So you get three Rambo highlighters.
There is a bronze one, and then of course there is the Unicorn Glow
Rambo highlighter, which you know, I tested one of those which is originally created
by Better Lace Beauty, a shout to them. I live for that brand. And it’s so cool that they
have inspired so many. And then we have next the everlasting
glow which looks like more of a liner I guess kind of skin toned,
that type
of highlighter when there's like silver and like white in there. So we’re gonna swatch them all
today,
we’re gonna play with it. And it also comes with this brush, the Unicorn Glow High
Lightening Brush. Now, I know so many people
have done these brushes now, we will see if this one
is amazing or not. So there are two lipsticks. They are ooh,
“Immortal Tears,” that’s cute. So this is an iridescent lip color. I think it's supposed to like
transform on your mouth. Like it looks like a certain color,
you put it on, it changes. Which I love those mood type of lipsticks,
is what I like to call them. And then we have three color icon loose
pigment, which of course are for eye, highlight, face, body, really whatever you want them to be for,
and they look like this, ooh. Now I I’m wearing blush only, and it has a highlighter,
I guess embedded into it, which I mean, I guess I kinda
knew that
when I put it on, but I didn’t know it was
gonna be that blinding. It’s by Natasha Denona,
it’s the duo glow. Yeah, I probably should
have read the word glow, so I do have a little bit
of glow to my face. Try to remember that, and then
we’re gonna try these on top of that. Alright, first I wanna unbox
the high lightening brush, with the little hallow packaging. Holographic is like... holographic anything
is just like... I dunno it’s just so cool, and it’s very trendy right now.
Here is what the brush looks like. This is of course, it says
a highlighting brush for precise application, ultra-soft
bristles for easy blending. Okay, let me feel. It does feel soft, very soft... cute, okay. Now let’s try the three highlighters first. Hmmm, I’m just go for the lightest one. This is called “Everlasting Glow”,
we will try this one first, and I do wanna take my clean finger,
and I am
gonna run through the whole entire thing. Okay, so it looks something like that. Now, I’ve tried rainbow highlighters
before on my channel, usually I’ll take like a flat brush and see
if I can get the unicorn, or unicorns, the rainbow effect
on my cheekbones and then you can also swirl it around
and it creates its own custom color. I’m gonna take this little
NARS Ita Brush and we’re just going to go
back and forth a few times. Oh, there is the color. And let’s see what happens. Oh, oh wow, you see that like
yellow kinda pinky tone? Now, I didn’t go completely rainbow
on my cheek, but I think... I can tell you this, it has pigment. Let me just go right over that,
no denying that there is pigment. I’m just gonna go with my fingers
one more time. And I’m gonna show you guys a little
swatch right there, it is very pale, so if you are someone who has
like a medium to dark skin tone, this one is not going
to work out for you. But let’s try the bronze one next,
and this
one is called Bronze Over the Rainbow. Okay, that’s a cute shade name. Now, the same thing, it has the kinda
like rainbow effect in the pan. I thought sometimes when
you fingers swatch things, the oils in your fingers can kinda
like fuck up the pigment. So let me just swatch
this with a brush first. Okay, so let me just go in with
a clean brush, and oh my Lord. That is what that looks like. Let me go on this side of my face
and see what happens. Alright, so to me, it still looks
kinda pale,
like the other one, so if you are someone that
is a little more like olive toned or even like medium
to dark skin tone, I don’t know if this highlighter
is going to work for you, 'cause it is pretty pale. And when you see it has a lot
of bling to it,
which I love. I’m actually gonna take some
right here on the brush, I’m just gonna go like this
and see what happens. Ooh, I’m like come on pigment. Okay, now the rainbow one,
I’ve actually already tried this, I’ve never tried it on
my channel though. This is of course their
Unicorn Glow Highlighter. Let’s open this bad boy up,
and it looks something like this. We’ve all seen rainbow
highlighters by now. They were such a big hit last year
and
they're not going anywhere I don’t think. So let me just take a… I’m just gonna take my finger for this
one,
I’m just gonna go in. Oh wow! Come on rainbow, and let me just
do a little swatch right there. Now see, that one has like that teal effect,
definitely, it’s still on the light side, and it does have like
an iridescent like light blue. Lemme... I never swatched
this one with my finger. Let me do it now that I’m done,
and there is that one. You can see it does have
more of a golden tone, but it is still very on the pale side,
to me I think. Do you remember the brush that came with it,
that I forgot to use? It's right here. And we’re going to... oh wow, see a white brush definitely shows
way more than something that already has like a dark color to it. So I think it definitely...
oh, look at that, holy shit! Where am I gonna put this? My chin, yeah, I might even layer
on top
and just see what happens. I'm like why do I wanna color my grandma
with highlighter, though? “Hey, girl.” Ooh, now I’m gonna take this and I’m gonna put it over
here just in the center. “Oh my God, I have so much highlighter on. Okay, that is really pretty, it is more on the little
powdery side, okay. So the highlighters are pretty good
if you
are someone that loves a fun glow. These are definitely gonna be something
you will wanna try out and they are very affordable,
which I love “Wet N Wild for. Alright, let’s try these
Unicorn Lipsticks. Alright now, Wet N Wild just put out these
brand new mega last iridescent lip colors. It says that they will radiate all things
Unicorn with this lip color that will leave you with a prismatic rainbow
effect that can never be seen as too much. Alright, so I wiped off my lip
gloss that I was wearing and now we are back to normal mouth,
I guess let’s just try ‘em out. So this one is called Unicorn Soul,
and it looks like this. Oh wow, it's like blue. Now, I heard that these change
colors when you put them on, maybe like a lip balm, or like a lip tint,
I’m not sure, but let’s find out. Ahah. Ooh, okay. Alright you guys, so I’m gonna give you
my first thoughts right off the bat. As usual, it doesn’t really have a smell,
which you know, I don’t mind. Almost like nothing,
it’s not bad at all. Now, the pigment on this for a drug
store brand
I thought was really cute. It definitely has that
like iridescent effect. I thought it was gonna be like
one of those transformers whirls, it's like green and then
it comes off pink. But this one has like a really pretty,
like duel chrome effect. When you see in the light as I’m moving,
it gives it kinda like a shimmer. My lips definitely have a pink undertone under,
and then it has that beautiful... I mean iridescent is the right word,
effect to it, Wow! Imagine this like
over a black lipstick or over something else that
make you look stunning, but by itself, I’m not mad at it. I will say this though, when I was applying it
over and over, it got a little streaky, like it didn’t wanna like move around
once it was on, if you can see right there. So I would definitely probably put a lip
primer under my lips just so it like really stay. But if you go back and forth a few times
it does end up looking really pretty. So let’s try the other one. Now this shade is called Immortal Tears
and it looks something like this. Oh wow, that is very pale. I wonder how it's going
to look on the mouth. Oh my God, okay,
so I didn’t
turn the lipstick earlier, but look what is embedded in the powder,
if you guys can look on the zoom. It’s a little unicorn head,
that is so adorable. I just wanna go heehee, alright,
we're gonna put her back in her cage. Alright, let’s give
this color a whirl. Ooh, come on, this fucking...
I mean this is like very dual chrome. Hmm, okay, this one definitely went on,
not that the other one was like streaky, but it went on a little less streaky as
I was like maneuvering it over and over. It almost feels like a lip balm,
it feels very like soft, I guess is the right word, it doesn’t
feel heavy,
it doesn’t feel weird. Same thing, really no fragrance,
I like how this one lights I think a little bit more, and I have like this pinky
undertone
under my mouth, and I of course wiped it off so there
was no foundation on my lips. I wanted to just like adhere
to my natural lip color, and I really like this one,
I think a little bit more you guys. These two lipstick colors were
very impressive for a drug store. I’m like okay you guys
I see what’s going on here. Now, I think it’s time to swatch
these pigments. Alright, so these are like the color
icon loose pigments, and this is in shade Pegasus Flutter,
I love that name, just gonna put it out there,
that is really adorable. It almost looks like an icy lavender color,
so let’s open her up. Oh wow, it has like almost like a little salt
shaker thing, that you have to snap up. Oh my God, these nails you guys. Imagine if I broke a nail
on my channel? Okay, ooh, it opened up really
easy actually, thank God. Sometimes you have to like peel
back plastic
and it’s so extra. Oh my God, this is really cute. So I’m just gonna pour a little
bit out,
maybe on my hand. Oh wow, it really comes out like salt. Let me just move it with my fingers,
so
you guys can see the color. Ooh okay, it is very light,
I will say this. I think I was expecting it to have
maybe a little bit more coverage. It's obviously there, but I thought
it was gonna be like blinding. But it’s cute, definitely
has a little shift to it? Yeah, I’m not really impressed
with this, but
it's definitely cute. You can definitely layer it over something,
but I’m not in love. Let me try this blue one. This one is called Unicorn Wishes
and it looks like a darkish navy color. Okay, let's put the blue on my hand.
Ooh, it has like really pretty... like flecks of gold in there if you guys
can see that on the zoom in. It’s pretty! Alright, let’s take a clean
finger
and let's blend her in to the skin. Oh wow! This one is way more pigmented
than the other one and it has... once you blend it out,
look at the gold in that blue. Holy shit, girl I’m like what
happened to this one, maybe this was supposed to be
more like a soft iridescent, but when the other one is this blinding, you wonder
what the fuck happened to the other one. Oh my God, that blue, girl,
I’m definitely impressed with that one. Alright, let’s move on to the third one,
and that one is called Mythical Dreams. it looks to be like a hot violet
purple type of color, which purples are hard to make you guys
in the eye shadow realm, girl. I don't know why, but purple eye shadows are
either very amazing or not it at all. Let’s try this out,
shake a little on. Okay, there is that.
I'm just gonna take... I’m like what finger is clean?
We’ll do the ring finger. And we’ll just massage
this into the skin. Whoo… ooh! Oh my Lord, that is really pretty.
I’m just gonna add a little bit more. Oh my God! Okay, these two are it, so I really love Mythical
Dreams and I love Unicorn Wishes. The other one really felt flat for me. Like the more I stare at these two, I’m like girl, is this supposed to be like,
I dunno, highlighter, body highlight? I mean obviously not, I dunno, but clearly one was kind of a dud for me
and the other two are beautiful. I cannot wait to use these
in upcoming tutorials. Okay you guys, we have swatched
the entire Unicorn Glow collection. Let me give you my final thoughts. Alright you guys, so we have
tried the entire collection. Now, I will say this about the rainbow highlighters,
I’m not the biggest fan of them. I like just regular highlighters
where you can just dip in, and you don’t have to swirl it
around; you can get a custom color. You guys know I’m such huge fans
of the Wet N Wild Mega Glow Highlighter. This one is one of my all time
favorites that they've ever put out. I was obsessed with them,
I mean
they are something fun to try out. And of course Wet N Wild is very
affordable,
so I would try them all. But in my opinion, the Mega Glow
ones are just a little bit better. Now moving onto
the iridescent lipsticks. I was shook, I mean this one has been
on my mouth for 20 minutes now. Hasn’t streaked, it hasn’t moved,
I've been drinking some Code Red, and… aah … it stayed, it’s nice,
it’s really, really pretty. I think for the price point,
these are amazing, and if you’re someone that doesn’t want
to have a matte lip on all the time, or something really bold, to me this
isn’t bold, it’s really cute and summery. And you can just throw this on, even if you have like sunglasses
on and you know, some concealer. This is probably one of my favorite
things from the collection. Now, of course we just tried the Loose Pigments,
and you already know my thoughts. These two shades are stunning,
unreal, pretty, beautiful, and I can’t wait to play with them. Now, on the other hand, this one, ahh, I dunno what happened girl,
I do not know what happened, but maybe you can put it in your inner
corner
or sweep it on your vagina, I have no idea, but this
one was not for me… BLEEP! But the other two were beautiful, so I think this entire collection in the box
is very affordable and amazing. I’m looking online and
the box is only $29.99 and you get everything
that I tried on today. So I think that’s
an amazing deal. Now, if you want the Unicorn brush
separate,
that is only $4.99. I’m like, girl, if you’re just
gonna buy the brush, you might as well buy
the whole damn thing. But if you only like the brush, of course
that is available by itself and yeah. Come on Wet N Wet, you fucking
showed me to the court today. There is a few kind of misses but overall,
it’s a really cool collection. I had a lot of fun trying this out
and I’m just
gonna put it out there right now. The Wet N Wild Unicorn Glow Box
is Jeffree Star approved. Thank you so much for watching and remember,

not sold separate I know a lot of people are asking they only come in the discounted bundle so this will retail for $52 and of course they will be on my website as well as Beauty Lycia Beauty Bay if you're in the UK and a lot of retailers will be carrying this so September 30th at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time that's 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time this baby will be out and I can't wait now I know a lot of people were asking about the fill wait on these and everything about it I'm gonna be doing a separate video in the future so let me stop running my damn mouth and let's jump into this actual so watch video so if you want to see me swatch a bunch of crazy-ass expensive liquid lips they keep on watching so I haven't filmed in a minute and I have so much makeup in front of me my head is spinning right now so I thought okay I am such a liquid lip whore I want to sit down and grab all the new liquid lips that I found in Sephora and online that are kind of pricey they're in that luxury tier price of like okay a little expensive is it worth it is it not so there are four formulas here today that I'm gonna be trying four different brands I have never tried before of course I've tried the brands but not the formula of this particular product so I think we should just jump right into it now the first brand that we're gonna test out today is from YSL Beauty they recently just dropped these brand new liquid lips they're calling them I'm gonna botch this you guys know I do not know how to speak French tad to wash how would you say that [Music] wash look at see that's what friends are for these are the touch wash couture matte stains from YSL the component looks something like this here is one of the shades so you get the gold chrome at the top the frosted kind of glass moment here and let's give us all the tea here to me these look a little small but they remind me of the Chanel ones and a bunch of other brands so the fill wait for this is zero point twenty ounces which is actually not that bad so I have heard that the applicator for this is weird and I like weird products so this baby will retail for $36 there are a bunch of shades I'm talking like oh my god I'm looking on the website girl there's like 20 damn shades let's open her up and just see what it looks like whoa look at that I'm gonna hold up my hands you can actually see that it is definitely like cut very thin look how thin that is Oh Lord that is a very unique doe foot I'm like hmm okay I'm just gonna go on the lip really weird I'm just gonna go in right now and try this this shade is called rose ink okay cute now before I put it on let me see what this is supposed to do is it supposed to be long-lasting is it supposed to stain what the hell is going on so on the website it says a lightweight lip stain with a revolutionary formula for ultra matte high-impact color and a lightweight naked lip feel okay so this formula is gonna give us a matte tattoo light color that is non drying okay high pigment stays fresh and it's supposed to be an eight hour wear hmm that's a big claim and the exclusive liner like applicator allows for a precision to outline and fill in the lip okay it is supposed to not only not feather it is not supposed to spill over the lip line girl let's get just watching okay this has the typical YSL like Rose smell if you've ever used their brand before I think all their stuff smells like that not bad let's see what happens now the pigment is a little more sheer than what I'm used to but then as its drying it is full coverage like we can't say it's not okay and that was only one dunk and you know this bitch has a big mouth so a little goes a long way okay I'm a little surprised at how well this applicator worked and at first I was like okay is it kind of sheer but as the formulas drying down it's been like 60 seconds literally it like looks nice now I do want to give it another minute to dry because it's still a little shiny in there as you guys can see so let's give us a minute and we'll be alright you guys so it's been a few minutes and the liquid lip still has a tiny little shine tool which I'm not mad at but in the Box obviously it says matte stain usually I'm not a fan of that type of formula but this one is nice Oh Mike and it did a little bit on my fingers not really that much just like tiny bit of staining I have a fan of this formula so far I think it definitely is really comfortable they said it was lightweight girl it's lightweight I love the wand on this the DOE foot excuse me I love the doe foot is very weird and unique I kind of live for it now there are other colors like I said today we're only gonna be trying out one color per formula but I do want to swatch a few who this one's pretty I just want to swatch a few to see what they look like if they are consistent you guys know tattoos I mean let's try it oh if that can cover a tattoo you know it has pigment so that is really pretty alright let's watch one more this one is a number in Devon oh it's like a pretty soft nude let's see what she looks like ooh bitch oh wow okay that looks a little more stringy than the other one a little meaning a lot maybe because it's a nude and it's supposed to like have your real look colors show through let me go over one more time so there may be a hit or miss with the formula a lot of times brands don't stay consistent when they have a bunch of colors sometimes the nudes are better sometimes the weird colors like the greens are streaky so as you see there is a little bit of weirdness with this one now I'm curious I gotta try another one okay let's open up one more rosewood game and this one looks like this way better pigment why is the nude one streaky I don't know you guys but this one is actually really pretty okay we're gonna have to you turret a tutorial okay so as you see here's what's going on let's move on you guys look at how dark my lips look that lipstick stain may I'm not mad at you guys I mean this is what happens anywhere makeup at this alright now let's try the new Smashbox always on metallic mattes they come in a little box like this and they're actually looking very similar to YSL which we all know Smashbox came out first but look here's Smashbox there's YSL same height same shape kind of same measurements look let's put them together Smashbox is baby really bigger and Smashbox is gonna claim that they have a fill weight of 0.13 ounces this one says 20 oh my god now look from making makeup myself I do know that when you metallus eyes something where you add this metallic formula to it there is less product for some reason I don't know why it's just how science works in chemistry so these will retail for $24 which is not bad why so's was a little up there Smashbox a little more flare in the price point so this brand is cruelty free this has a bunch of shades for this well i grabbed a bunch now the ones that have been like singing to my heart are these Reds right here we are getting into the fall holiday season this one right here is called maneater and then this one veno Noir I saw my girl Laura Lee wear this and I was like I'm owning that color so I might even do a little I'll bring her this today let's see here oh yeah Smashbox has a really nice dope foot it's nice and long it's thin adheres to the lips very nicely and here's what that looks like and I might outline my lips in this and put that other metallic in the center let's see what happened this formula is of course long-lasting and it's supposed to stay on as well it's called always on for a reason let's see how she looks so I'm gonna leave the center in there and just outline my lips real quickly now we're gonna take man-eater and put it in the middle and do a little ombre moment oh look at that red girl mmm now I like to take a clean eyeshadow brush or even my finger and I will just go in and just kind of blend out the edges and it makes your lips look very airbrushed and three-dimensional so the formula is dry it also feels really lightweight like the previous one I really love this color combo I'm like dying for the metallic I just lived for the finish it feels nice it dried quick nothing's on my finger so it is a very long-lasting it feels great damn Smashbox you better work alright so it comes in a little box like this and when you open this bad boy up it comes in the component that looks like this I love the fade I love how girl on packaging looks it's very cut and pretty looks very royal now this is gonna retail for $32 it is up there and this is supposed to be a creamy velvet lip color with intense pigments and lip friendly ingredients creamy like a gloss and pigmented like a lipstick with a stunning matte finish okay so it's probably gonna dry matte it's easy to apply and it has a highly pigmented long-lasting plumped look I'm down for that baby this formula in coorporate hyaluronic acid and tiger grass to moisturize and smooth for comfortable wear this brand only launched seven colours girl I was expecting like 20 come on but there's a bunch of colors so we have nudes we have red I just got all seven you guys so I'm like you know let's see what what I'm in the mood for we can do this red one let's try it I've had so much red on my mouth though I'm scared let's do it nude you guys let's do a nude this one is called charming beige and it looks like this so this has a fill weight of 0.23 fluid ounces now when you open it up it looks like this okay so another kind of flat dough foot it is a little on the smaller side which I don't mind it all love it it looks at velvety Oh smells very fresh almost looks like like skin care honestly here we go here is the color swatch now this formula is a very creamy very pigmented right away it felt good it was probably the easiest one to apply I don't know why the formula just kind of like glided on my mouth and bam here we are a few seconds later it's moisturizing it feels really good it's still another lightweight formula I can't believe we are testing all these brands and three of them so far out of four have been very like hydrating and lightweight I feel like I've said that word so many times but it just doesn't feel like there's really much on my lips love the color it feels really good another a-plus I'm a little shook now we're gonna try our fourth and final brand oh god help me alright so this one is from the brand Charlotte Tilbury which has had a lot of hits and a lot of misses on this channel this is her formula for a liquid lip and this is the Hollywood lips what is this supposed to do first of all the fill weight is 0.24 ounces which is pretty good I like the component the rose gold is cute her logo with the design you got the little window so you can see the color of course the illusion of filler oh wow this is gonna give you wider lips in one easy application it says it will appear that your lips will be looked at through a hyper-real filter the Crescent applicator is designed to mimic the natural curve of your mouth okay we have we have just pull that out look and as anti-aging sea lavender as it's active ingredient with a combined affirming and plumping action that makes it a great natural solution for slowing down the sides of aging sign me up it also has a long wear finish with beeswax to prevent it from being dry so you have moisture that is supposed to leave your lips baby soft that's a lot of claims let's get to swashing people so we're gonna open this bad bitch up and oh it is curved okay let me hold up my hand so you guys can really see so there is the curve and you see the full turn okay I mean my mouth so pink let's just try on this color scream siren let's give her a whirl [Music] here is the color swatch so here's the thing this is the best smelling one out of all four I love how it smells the color beautiful only con I have is that the formula is a little more like gummy and thick so we're really gonna zoom in here you can see how the formula is very thick see I'm just gonna put a little bit on the edge trying to line the lips it was a little bit harder than the other three so that was my only con with this one but the payoff looks beautiful I love a blue based red like this especially the blue hair it's stunning I'm feeling like a mermaid oh oh yeah I forgot that highlight right there damn what's that current you lookin snitch alright we have tried four colors my mouth is tired let's get to my final thoughts alright you guys so we tried out YSL we tried out Smashbox grill on and Charlotte Tilbury and I gotta say all four formulas worked like there's no if ands or buts about it all of them have their pros and their cons but overall they were really consistently great which is kind of shocking because when you pick for luxury brands there has to be a debt in there but there's not I'm sitting here like I want to not like something but there's nothing to know like okay let's just start from the top here Grill on was creamy great beautiful I'm Charlotte Tilbury of course we just tried that love it oh here we go though it's at a tower where damn girl that finger is and I've had this on for minutes now I did not dry all the way down but the coverage though is so pretty I could definitely overlook it but if you want something really long-lasting I would go with Smashbox and YSL obviously it stained my lips and probably gonna have that pink shade on my mouth for like a week now but overall what is my favorite Smashbox is the winner this formula now I've tried the pure mattes stunning this metallic blew me away when they dried down there was no transfer there beautiful there is a lot of shades there's a lot of colors I didn't even swatch of course today we got purples we got browns I'm I'm down I'm literally gonna log in and buy it every damn color oh and Smashbox was actually the cheapest at $24 I don't even know if I said this price point $34 this was 36 and then these were in the 20s matchbox 24 bucks for something that actually works with a lot of different colors I think that's the winner people thank you so much for watching this video and all right you guys thank you so much for watching this I'll see you on the next one what 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I'm really excited because we are going to be testing out the brand-new k'kaw beauty contour and highlighting kits and of course if you're know what k'kaw is maybe you live under a rock or maybe you just don't ever turn on the TV but of course we are going to be talking about the Kim kardashian-west brand new makeup products now I actually got to go to Kim's house this week and go to the launch party spend some time with her talk about the product and see it all in the works and it was really cool to just have one-on-one time with her and actually hang out and talk you know a lot of you saw me on Kim's snapchat and you were like oh if you haven't seen our picture on Instagram I'm going to throw it up on the screen right now we also took some really cute pictures from a photo booth and I'll also throw up some other pictures of me and my friends from the party so we're just going to flash them on the screen it was such an amazing event and I know that whenever I talk about the Kardashians or Kylie on my channel and it's always a little controversial I don't know why well I do but people are just so crazy at the end of the day I'm such a big fan of people who are entrepreneurs and the fact that Kim has made such a huge brand and a whole family I just think it's really cool and whatever your personal feelings are about someone who looks let's just do a little fact check you never met any of them you've only read the magazines and seen what the news wants to tell you you've watched a TV show maybe you've heard some rumors if no one's ever met somebody how can you really say anything about them at the end of the day I have had amazing experiences with Kim and her mom and the family and I love what they're doing so in this video today it's going to be kind of like a get ready with my face I am going to be doing a primer foundation concealer and that is what you do to prep your skin on the k'kaw website before you do the contour stick you guys it says start with your favorite primer followed by foundation and concealer so the product before we even dive into all of this it looks like this and of course at the party you know they gave us everything so it came in this cute little bag and it came with all four of the kits let me just take all of these out it goes from light medium dark and deep dark so I love that she is catering to every skin tone now everyone always has such crazy mixed feelings about packaging I personally think that this is cool I think every single thing including my brand comes in a unicorn it comes in a box we've seen it all before have we not we have I think that this is a unique idea I love it it's giving me Pat McGrath vibes and I live for her so basically you've got to open this bad boy up and voila I love it it's very like medical and sterile and has a kind of a cool vibe I love the feel of this it looks really cool it's definitely different and makes a statement so in this kit which retails for of $48 you get a cream contour stick with it which is double ended and you also get a highlighting stick as well and it comes with a dual ended brush so of course we are going to test out everything in this today but first I do want to prep my skin before we dive in so if you want to see me test this bad boy out then keep on watching all right of course first we are going to prime the skin and I'm going to be a little bougie today because we are talking about Kim K so we are going to use a primer by by Terry this is a very luxurious skin care and makeup brand you want to see me review this actually try it against a twelve dollar primer so I will link that video down below and I'm just going to apply this with a damp Beauty Blender and I'm going to dunk it in and I know it looks like it's foundation but it's not [Music] now we're going to go in with one of Kim's favorite foundations this is actually one of my favorites as well I've been using this for a few years now this is the of course dirt or money alumina silk foundation I'm sure you have seen a lot of beauty gurus use this before it is one of the best and usually and mix it but today we're going to go for a more soft dewy look which is like kind of Kim's neck kind of it is Kim's signature look she does not wear full crazy makeup all the time I love when her face is very minimal and dewy and it's just very contoured and chiseled and like really fresh and just like we're in summer baby let's fucking get started so we are just going to of course use the damp Beauty Blender and get to buffing [Music] all right the foundation looks really pretty really dewy now I wanted to barely a little bit of concealer just er like really have that moment so I'm going to go in today with the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD concealer this one is pretty smashed and I love how it looks [Music] all right so I'm just going to take some scissors to this or can you pull this Kenny hmm I'm just gonna cut it because that's what I would normally do in real life oh now look mistaken there is a little tear tab right there alright so we're going to shake everything out so here are the two sticks I love the all-nude packaging you guys know I'm all about cute little packaging and I love how it's very monochromatic just like when Kim collabed with Kylie this kit also comes with of course the dual ended brush and it comes in a sealed plastic little moment now I got to play with these at the party on my hand of course I've never tried it on my face I love this brush because it just feels really soft it's like mmm it feels really nice and of course this is the sponge let's see what the Realty is contour shade highlight and sculpt with the cream contour and highlight sticks the ultra creamy and buildable formula makes application easy and blends for a seamless look the dual ended contour stick features two shades ideal for sculpting hollows of the cheeks hairline nose and jawline the dual ended highlighter stick so I guess this has a matte highlight for brightening without shimmer and a shimmer highlight for a more intense glow use the dual ended blending brush and sponge applicator to blend the formulas into the skin okay cool so before I turn on the face let's open these bitches up and let's see what they look like this one is the contour stick this is in shade light it looks like this now I love this because in a lot of the promo videos that Kim posted on her Instagram she said that it's really cool for even doing like under the eye and in the hollows of the of course cheeks but also in your crease or your lid and obviously when this dries it can look exactly like eyeshadow so it just gives you kind of that overall sculpted look and then we have a another shade right here so I'll definitely play with both of these today these are really creamy and blendable now of course we're about to test them on the face but on the hand they just feel really nice now I don't always scream contour but when I do I and they still really really like soft so those are the two shades for the light now let's open up the highlights stick once again it comes with they said a matte side which I'm going to assume oh yeah that is definitely matte so let's put that right here for you guys to all see oh yeah work and then of course the highlighting side which I guess is supposed to have a glow who will swatch that right here oh yeah that has a glow girl that has a fuckin glow it's a cream glow which I kind of like and it's different so let's start with the contour first I am going to take this side which one should I do okay I'm more of like this type of vibe I'm very cool toned so let me put this on my face and see what happens now Kim's makeup artist Mario was their shadow to Mario you are everything he said that this is a very light buildable formula obviously it's not supposed to be drag queen makeup here so I'm just going to take this and let's just see what happens okay so I really like the brush I was a little scared because a lot of times and things come with a brush I'm always like uh uh like you know those eyeshadow palettes that has the one brush and you're like girl but this is a really nice and now the sponge I obviously don't know how that works yet so I'm just going to finish this little moment Wow I like how soft this is it's not too harsh it's not really severe it's like kind of the perfect amount also I do want to know you guys of course when you buy something you don't have to use the brush it comes with you can of course use any brush you want to blend out you can use a beauty blender to blend it out not that it needs it but you know we're all artists and we love to use the tools that we love to use so I think that's important to note all right now of course we are going to do the other side of the face okay now we're going to do the nose and I'm going to contour the nose like really sharp if you want to have your nostrils appear smaller add a little darkness on them it will definitely push that in and of course I'm just doing this for fun I like my nose but contouring is fine it to make up now let's of course do it wrong yes bitch I'm already feeling chiseled to fill right now you guys know mama has surgery she wants out forehead extra snatched already all right let's get to blending all this out okay just first lime you guys I just went through the difference with my damp at Beauty Blender I'm just going to take this and just do this side of my jaw okay cool so what I like about the brush is that the Beauty Blender I mean definitely soaked up a lot more product which we all know that's the beauty blenders do so I'd have to add more product and more product to really get the coverage that this brings you with just the brush so if you're someone that doesn't want to really waste a lot of product you can definitely just stick to the brush I know that they told me that the formula was like sheer and it definitely kind of has this sheer by but it's definitely pigmented which is good because you want obviously it just show up I think next time I'll definitely maybe even use a little less product because it didn't need that much I'm a little shook with that all right now let's blend out this forehead all right the face is sculpted this is really nice so now we're going to dive into this guy now the matte highlight I'd already put concealer on but if you want to highlight other areas it says that the matte highlight can be used as concealer eyelid primer and or color correction depending on your skin tone finished by blending the highlight with your sponge oh okay well we can always just do a little test and just kind of do it a little I like doing highlight under my contour sometimes to really add it like you know add and define those cheekbones like doing with such an opinion I'm trying to try this on my lids why not now our need you like to shade a lot of the times and things say like they're not light enough or like you all have seen me reviewed concealers on my channel and on my girl that's not light enough again I saw a video where people were like blending this out with their finger which you guys know I'm not into really doing makeup with my fingers but a lot of artists on set loved doing it but I just want to know that like this formula on this is already like really nice come on blending okay let's take the sponge I am going to wet it a little bit with some six-plus all right let's take this and I'm just going to press this into the skin see you guys I'm not really into hard sponges like this like the texture it's like a little harder than a Beauty Blender i personally would just take like in our teeth brush or a different brush like even like what is the sky a little more py2 and i would just go like that and blend it out in one second I mean look how quick this does it ready so I didn't really love how this brush was blending it out I think that it was just kind of making it a little more difficult yeah I'm kind of difficult then it should be so I'm just going to go in with the Beauty Blender and just buff that out before it dries please don't dry under my eyes I'm going to scream alright now let's move on to and the shimmer but the shimmer highlight it says to apply it on the cheekbone brow bone I don't have eyebrows Cupid's bow kiss is a nose inner corner of the eyes and any other areas where you want a subtle shimmer the shimmer highlight can also be used on the collarbone and shoulders for an all-over glow okay girl so let's do the cheekbones girl does she have fucking cheekbones honey we'll do the tip of the nose I know huh girl so now I'm going to do the inner corner because I love that that is even on there like yes girl just a little subtlety growl boom we're gonna skip Cupid's bow already got lipstick on bhai and then shoulder should we try a little on Catwoman baby mm-hmm mmm all right now I'm gonna take this ooh oh that is pretty it's like hello summer how are you all right don't look at my booby now we are going to blend this highlight out usually if it's a cream I'm going to use a beauty blender that of course it's on my body oh my god I'm covering it wait a minute all right let's blend this out [Applause] it definitely has like that subtle glow moment now we all know Kim is not known for her crazy metallic glow she is definitely the contour Queen and she's not a highlighting whore so I am just going to say I'm not mad at how subtle this is I know most of your line girl I know you ain't yeah I know you may all about that low shimmer but I think it's subtle it's pretty and for this look it's kind of cool inner would see this without being blended out it's really cute all right you guys the highlight is on I actually like it when it hits the light is a very subtle it's very cute my shoulders looking snatched I kind of want to put some right here and all over my body I kind of want to put it on my labia so you can definitely do stuff like that add more highlight all right let me put my titties away and let me give you guys my final thoughts all right you guys so I just went downstairs for a little bit I had some fruity pebbles who's into fruity pebbles by the way obsessed and I said my dogs when I went outside for a little bit PS oh my god it is so hot in California already summer's here but anyway I came back upstairs and I'm a little shocked that nothing under my eye we can do a little zoom in right now there's no creasing like I haven't said it with anything yet there's no setting powder and it feels really nice it feels like I know I feel healthy and I know that's kind of weird to say but it just feels very like oh I'm feeling natural maybe it's the hair I don't know okay so my final thoughts are this for $48 you get all three items of course to contour colors to highlighters and the brush the only complaint I'm going to say that I'm not a fan of was the sponge tip applicator but at the end of the day I have so many brushes and I know a lot of you at home have your own brushes so you wouldn't really even use this if you were someone on the go that really needs this this is not that great but good this side is actually really good it does not soak up any product it blended out the contour very nice now the formula I love it I really love this formula for a cream contour and this bitch has tried out a lot of creams I really loved it it wasn't too heavy it was too muddy it blended out really pretty and it's just very natural I can't believe I'm standing natural that's a little scary to me the highlighter of course the matte one was more of like a concealer effect it did work was not the biggest fan of it just because you know while ago whoa coverage concealer but if you're someone that likes the more you know natural side of things you are going to love it I think the shimmer is pretty for someone that doesn't love an extreme glow and that's okay if you don't want your cheeks to blind people and cause car crashes and stick to the head to this one so the more I'm looking at my monitor I know you guys see me looking always over here at the monitor I really like the natural kind of shift of the glow I think this is a very natural like I want to put on sunglasses and go run some errands and be on my knees it's definitely that type of vibe so is the k'kaw beauty Kim Kardashian contour and highlighting kits Jeffers our group insurance honking I really like the formula you guys I'm glad that it is a hit because of course I was a little nervous and I also saw a sneak peeks of them working on powder contour colors and a bunch of other stuff so I feel like Kendra all be giving us a lot of shit this year and I can't wait to try it so thank you guys so much for watching this review I hope you loved it and of course I hope you guys got to see a better look at the product engage your own opinion of course makeup is makeup we all have different experiences and this is mine so thank you so much for watching and I'll see you on the next one mwah bye guys 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel hi how are ya today we're gonna do a little battle of the mascaras if you will no this is not the game of Thrones but this is a little game of beauty and today we're going to put one of my favorite if not favorite ever mascaras on the planet versus a new one that just hit the market we're gonna see which one reigns supreme so today I am of course talking about the iconic roller lash from Benefit Cosmetics yes I know this sounds like a shameless plug but I was the face of this mascara last summer this has been on my channel since I started it two years ago and it is a staple in my collection so we all know I have used this on my channel a million times I can't even imagine counting all the tutorials that this has made a little appearance so what are we going to put up against the roller lash today well we're just first of all let's just bring this into frame excuse me everybody I'm backing up alright so this came to my door in PR the other day and I'm out died okay yes this is a huge picture of my face in an astronaut suit and here is the introduction to the Benefit Cosmetics of bad gal bang 36-hour full blast volumizing mascara and then it comes with this crazy thing right here which when you open it up yes it's actually pink I'm living and breathing and dying I'm actually gonna turn off one of these lights you can see how really pink this is cuz I'm kind of living for it oh look at that and PS look at my highlight yes sarcophagus she better work lights on alright so here's how it came I'm just gonna pop this mascara out because oh that was heavy alright oh okay I'm not to give a first impressions on this because it feels nice and it came with a little travel mini which i think is so adorable so here is what the bad gal bang mascara looks like it has studs on the packaging of course and it feels matte soft touch so it feels really nice very heavy and sturdy just how I like my men so we're going to open this up and let's see what kind of wand is on it oh okay first of all you guys see how it Wiggles it bends very easy so the bristles you see are very thin let me put my hand here in case you guys need an extra little zoom in so the bristles appear to be very short and spiky they are allegedly going to do some magic to these lashes so let's refresh our memory on the roller lash and let's see what the hell bad guy was supposed to do all right before we dive into this first impressions I want to quickly say thank you guys so much for such an incredible opening day of sales for the blood sugar palate and the love sick collection like girl you had me crying on synapse at like a little baby it was such a surreal moment just to see I'm like speechless again just to see the overwhelming support for the palette and it was an unreal magical moment so thank you guys so much for that you guys have broke all my records in sales today and I'm just like oh 2018 we are starting off right let's get into the Hunger Games all right so just for a little refresher here is what the benefit roller lash mascara looks like this product has 0.30 bounces which is eight point five grams this one comes in two colors of course it is a V black and the name is brown I love both this is such a favorite of mine and it was such a crazy and surreal moment to be able to be the face of it last summer in Sephora which was just it was a cool goal of mine that I always wanted to accomplish and yeah you guys really supported this they sold a thousands and thousands of mascaras and yeah I was really proud of that moment so thanks to you guys for making it such a hit alright so besides that you guys remember this mascara it lifts and curls it has a very volumizing feel to it I love this today we're gonna place the roller lash on the left side on this eye and then we are going to and then only right eye we're gonna try the bad gal paying so let's see what this mascara is supposed to do now let's get my FAQ sheet so this is allegedly a 36-hour full blast of volumizing mascara that creates massive volume without weighing down lashes okay I like the sound of that this says this is a gravity-defying formula it contains aero particles which are one of the lightest known materials derived from space technology oh this innovative intense pitch black mascara layers easily for bigger impact it's custom-built slim packed brush is designed for reach from root to tip and corn in the corner of both from your upper and lower lashes for big volume with 360 degree reach I'm like girl just gonna like blow me too I'm excited okay so it's smudge proof its water-resistant its volumizing and it also has the pro vitamin b5 to support natural lash thickness and strength all right so allegedly this is gonna be amazing that's basically what this says so yeah I think let's try the products and let's see if this is gonna be a new favor I'm scared you guys I have loved this for so long but do we have a new contender we're about to find out first of all you guys we have a moment of silence for this jacket like bitch look at that Gucci you did that Hey all right you guys let me move my hair out of the way and now we are going to do a little zoom in and here is a fresh roller lash now I may have some glue residue in my lashes I have been filming a lot this week so excuse me if my lashes look a little oh little janky a little scary alright so let's take the Rose eyelash and give it a whirl [Music] now I'm gonna dip in one more time for the bottom so they are very pitch black like my soul all right there is the roller lash mascara I'm sorry you guys this is a good-ass mascara I'm looking in the monitor like mmm just so natural and pretty alright whoa let's get to the other side scooting over this way hi oh wow mommy needs some mascara all right so let's give this a whirl I am excited to try this oh oh there is the wand I'm gonna do a little comparison so you guys can see the difference of these two and here they are very different in size and shape so let's give this a whirl okay hold on now holy okay now let's do some bottoms I'm gonna dip it in because there's so much product on the brush you really need like one dip all right here is the bad gal bang mascara on now girl first impressions a let's dive into it right now well let's give you guys a little zoom in so here is the roller lash side right here and then here is the bad gal bang side over here [Music] all right so let me look in the mirror oh wow okay so definitely right away the bad gal is more dramatic girl there is a drama on my lashes they are thick they look fake there's a lot more product on the lash than this side only a little more thicker and more together like the roller lash looks more separated soft and pretty whereas this one is like Hello we are going somewhere important and you better look me in my eyes alright so the bottom lashes look a lot thicker and this side looks a little more soft and gentle and this one is like full-on hello there do you need to get swallowed I don't know which one I like more I'm sitting here like I'm speechless for a second roller lash is just like so iconic it's so pretty this one is definitely more like Vavoom it's like dramatic the lashes appear even more darker like this one is black but this one is like that cold jet black which I know a lot of us love now let me just touch this look at them long lashes it definitely gave me a lot of length and there's really nothing on my finger like a little tiny black so it is taking a second to dry it's a little more like more wet consistency and it's said that it was gonna be weightless but this one actually feels a tiny bit heavier than the roller lash now I'm sure a lot of you just pop on false lashes anyway but if you're someone that just wants to wear a mascara on the go this one might be a little bit more comfortable but this one isn't like annoying me or bothering me it just feels a little bit more heavy if you guys know what I mean I'm gonna gonna let this fully dry and let's see how we're feeling alright you guys so I am so shook because first of all good morning I don't know which one I like better like I actually like both but for two different reasons like there really isn't a negative this one is a lot thicker so I feel like my lashes look a little bit more like not stuck together but it's a little bit more like spidery whereas this side is a lot more like hi I'm going to a wedding I might go to an orgy so really I don't know I do know this let me just say this right off the bat the Benefit Cosmetics bad gal bang mascara is Geoffrey star I gotta say that right off the bat it looks stunning it is dramatic like mmm like if you're someone that is more simple and you just want to have like dramatic lashes and just add a little shimmer to your lid like this look today very minimalistic I think this is perfect you don't have to waste the time of putting on false lashes dealing with the glue the tweezer is everything if you just want to like hi BAM we're ready to roll definitely it would recommend this roller lash is always gonna be a staple but this might be a new contender I can't decide if I if I like him were it's just different it's just a different vibe and I love both vibes so honestly today there might be a stalemate because there really is no winner it really depends on the effect that you want I think the roller lash is always gonna be a staple for me but this is a new contender so we will see in future videos how we are loving this but for now it is a stalemate because they both won which has never happened on this channel before so I'm having a moment of silence okay so anyway sound off below let me know what you guys think which eye do you like better did you love the bad gal or did you love the roller sound off give me some feedback let me know what's up and yeah thank you guys for watching this video I am going to go test this out and see if it's really water-resistant and maybe go splash in the jacuzzi until next time you guys thank you so much for watching and I will see you on the next one mwah 
Hey everyone! Oh my God,
today we are going to finally reveal the Jeffree Star Cosmetics
Chrome Summer Collection. There has been so many sneak
peeks all over the internet. I’ve been doing a lot of photo shoots
and its finally time to reveal the entire collection. Now, this has been a long
time in the making and I am really excited because
last summer, remember, everything was in hot y
ellow packaging? And last year, oh my God,
like when Summer hit, it was my biggest launch
to date as a brand. And now that we are another
year in, my brain is like, oh my God! Like you guys, this November
my brand turns three years old. I’m psyched! Now, for this Summer
I have turned everything chrome. Now this is actually my biggest
collection to date ever as a brand. And… drum roll please… we are
launching 8 Velour Liquid Lipsticks. 6 of them are matte and
2 of them are metallic. And I’m also releasing 5 Lip Ammunition
which, of course, are my stick lipstick formula. And we have 2 Skin Frost Highlighters. And 3 Velour Lip Scrubs. Oh my God, you guys,
I like took it there this Summer and I made them so yummy and delicious. Wait til you see the flavors later. I’m really excited to announce
that there are 2 Bundles. I have, of course,
sneak peeked them online. If you haven’t seen them,
you are about to right now. The first one is called the YOU BETTER WORK VELOUR LIQUID
LIPSTICK COLLECTION BUNDLE. So, with this bundle you get
all 8 Velour Liquid Lipsticks, of course, at a very discounted
price of $105. If you were to purchase all of these
individually they would be $144. So, you are getting
a really nice discount. And of course, this box and all
the colors are Limited Edition, as are everything in this collection. So, once they’re gone,
Baby, they are gone. So I’m really excited to offer
you guys this amazing deal. And then, if you want all 5 of the Lip Ammo
and all 8 of the Liquid Lips, so that would be the entire lip collection, this Summer I am introducing the first ever Jeffree Star Cosmetics LIPSTICK VAULT. And you guys get all
of the lipsticks in here. We gotta open her up.
I mean, look, she’s big. You can put it next to my head,
it’s like, Girl, she’s big! You guys, this is a lotta product. So, if you are a lipstick
addict or a lipstick hoarder, you are going to be in love with this. So, of course, it has my logo
repeated everywhere. And of course, all of the lipsticks
are enclosed in here. Alright, now I know a lot of you have
been dying to know the prices. So, this will retail for $195.
I know that is a lot of money. But if you are a lipstick collector I know
that these are probably going to go quickly. Now if you were to buy them all
individually, it would be over $230. I think it’s about like $234. So you of course get an extreme
discount with this one as well. And, oh my God, you guys, I’m really
happy with how the packaging turned out. Everything looks beautiful. And I’m really excited for you guys
to see what is inside of this. Now, besides the lip products, you know
I’m not playing games this Summer. So, besides that, you guys, I have two
brand new Skin Frost Highlighters. Now, I’ve never released
these shades before. Of course, everything in this
collection is brand new and I’m really excited
for you to see these. You guys wanna know the names right now?
You might as well know the names right now. So, there is one that is called,
Summer Snow cone, and the other one is called
Crystal Ball. I will swatch them, of course,
later in the video. And besides that, you guys, no,
we’re not done, we’re not done. I have 3 Velour Lip Scrubs. Now, I know so many
of you are a fan of them, and this Summer we have
these amazing flavors. I really wanted to like take it there
with the smell and the taste, and just get them really
fresh and amazing. So, with these guys, I will of course be showing them
all later in the video as well. And I wish you can taste them through
the screen because, they’re amazing. Everything in the entire collection
will be available individually. So, if you’re like, Girl, I only like,
like two lipsticks or three, you can definitely just buy those. Or if you want everything,
of course, you can get everything. We’re about to dive
into some swatches. So if you wanna see everything tried
out on my mouth and on my cheeks, then keep on watching. Alright you guys, I removed my lipstick,
now let’s get to swatching. I’m gonna start with
the Liquid Lipsticks first. And then I will be doing the Lip Ammo. And then of course the Skin Frost. And then we’ll be playing
with the Lip Scrubs. So if you wanna jump around
in the video, of course you can. But with the Velour Liquid Lipsticks
we have 8 shades this Summer. 6 of them are of course matte.
In my normal amazing formula. Yes, I just called my own formula amazing.
Don’t clock me. Now this Summer, the metallic
shades smell like strawberries. Oh my God, they’re so yummy.
But the mattes don’t have any fragrance. I noticed that sometimes
when you add fragrances to lipsticks it can kind of manipulate
or change them, and I’m not really into
compromising the formula. I have perfected adding Root Beer
in some of mine, and of Creamsicle in my Lip Ammo,
but this Summer, we’re gonna relax. So, let’s get started. The first shade is the lightest in the collection
and it looks something like this. It is called Butt Naked. It is a gorgeous peachy nude, it is really light but also really
stunning and it just looks like, ah. Let me show you guys
what she looks like. Alright, here is what
Butt Naked looks like. It is really light, so if you are of course,
medium or dark skin tone, I would definitely recommend ombréing
them or using a lip liner, or i mean, if you wanna be bold
and do it by itself, i think that would also look kinda stunning,
a little high fashion, and I’m obsessed with that look.
Let’s see the next one. Alright, the next shade I actually wore
in a video about a month or two ago. It was my Full Face First Impression,
and I used this shade in the video. It is called Calabasas, which of course,
is the city where I live in California. This color just really reminded me
of home when it was on. I don't know why I got that feeling
but it just came over me. So, I named it after that.
And it is a really gorgeous color. I know a lot of you kept asking me like,
oh my God, what is that? And when I finally wore it I know
a lot of you were excited about it. So, I can’t wait to see
this on all of you. But I am, of course, going to swatch it
again for anyone that didn’t see it. Here is it all swatched on my lips. I think this might be one of my favorite
Liquid Lips from the 8, I am just like, I’ve been wearing
this morning and night. And the third shade is this beautiful,
warm toned, camel nude called Hunty. Oh my God, you guys,
I am obsessed with this shade. When I making in the lab I wanted
something that was very like, like really warm and rich looking
and I think this is going to be one of you guys’ favorites.
Let’s swatch her. Here is shade Hunty, dry. Mwah! The next shade is the darkest
shade in the collection. It is called Family Jewels and it is a beautiful,
warm toned like, chocolatey brown. It’s like a milk chocolate,
it is so stunning. And let’s give her a whirl. And here is Family Jewels,
dried down. Mwah! Alright, the next shade is
a really cool funky color. You guys know I have to have
some weird colors in my brand. I am all down for being a weirdo
and this one is very daring. It is a matte chartreuse color
and it is called Venus Flytrap. It is very daring,
it’s very bold, obviously. And the cool thing about my brand
and the formula is that all of my Velour Liquid Lips are eye safe,
so you can put them in your waterline, you can use them as eyeliner,
you can do them as a wing. So they’re of course
very multi-use. A lot of people love doing lip art,
they love ombréing and the love being creative,
so this is for all my artists out there. And here is Venus Flytrap, dried down. Now you know what’s crazy,
when you make cosmetics, you guys weird colors like yellow and
weird purples and greens, are really difficult to make.
But I think this one is really amazing. It doesn’t look crazy. Well,
the color looks a little crazy. But I tried to make this like
matte as hell. And I love it. So the next person that invites me
to a wedding, I’m wearing this. Let’s swatch a few metallics
before we do the final matte lip. Now, this is a gorgeous, I’m gonna
call it, like a coral, pinky, crazy metallic, and this shade
is called Candy Ass. This one is blinging.
It is full of like sparkle. Lemme show you guys
what this looks like. Alright, here is Candy Ass, dry. Now if you see how I move my head
in the light, it is very reflective. It is really pretty. And has a lot
of metallic pearls in there to give it such a beautiful finish. And of course, when I say pearls,
I mean pearl pigments that are man-made, and not pearls from the oceans. Some people are like, wait a minute.
Don’t get it twisted. I am obsessed with this color and I think it is gonna be
perfect for Summer. The second metallic shade in the collection
is called Flamboyant. It is a gorgeous, bright coral,
like on fire, in your face coral. And this metallic
is a little different than Candy Ass. It has less like metal feel but still has
like that glittery just amazingness. And remember that these metallics in the Summer
Collection smell like fresh strawberries. Ah, I’m hungry. And here is Flamboyant,
dry on the mouth. It has such a gorgeous sheen
to it and it is very bright. Alright, let’s swatch the last one. Last but not least, the last matte Liquid Lip
in the collection is a stunning, gorgeous, bright purple. So many of you have been requesting me
to make a purple like this in my collection and it’s finally here. It’s in fruitation. Now, this shade
is called You. Better. Work. which of course, the lipstick
bundle was named after. I mean, I think I’ve said that saying
since I was like 10 years old. We have RuPaul saying it.
We have Britney Spears saying it. And it’s kinda like a staple in the make-up
community, so You Better Get on My Mouth. And here’s the shade
dry on the lips. It is such a vibrant,
gorgeous purple. So, I hope you guys love all
of the Velour Liquid Lipsticks from the collection and now let’s
swatch some Lip Ammunition. Now the first shade from the Lip
Ammunition Chrome Collection is called Birkin Suede,
which if you know me, you know I am a fashion whore
and this was definitely inspired by one of my favorite colors
of suede inside of a handbag. It is probably the lightest
nude from this collection. She looks something like
this in the component. And let’s get her on the mouth. Here is Birkin Suede swatched. It is definitely the lightest
nude in the collection so, if you are a little darker
than this color, or way darker, of course
you can match it with any lip liner and
it will look flawless. Alright, now the next shade is this
beautiful warm toned brown. It is called Birthday Suit. And it is one of my favorites
from the collection. And let’s see how she looks on. Here is Birthday Suit. And the third shade is
this beautiful terracotta. I like to call her like an orange nude. And she is called Star Witness. Listen, this color is going
to look amazing and stunning and beautiful on everyone. So, let’s give her a swatch. Alright, here is Star Witness. Alright, and the next shade
is called Thick as Thieves which is one of my favorite
little sayings about people. And this is the darkest
shade of the collection. It looks something like this. Lemme
show you guys what she looks like. Here is Thick as Thieves. Alright, last but not least,
is one of my favorite shades. Now I actually wore this on
my channel in the previous video and everyone was like, Girl, what lipstick
are you wearing? And I’m over here like, I don't know.
It was a color in my line. So, this shade is called Skin Tight. It is a beautiful, gorgeous, peachy nude
and it looks something like this. So let’s give her a spin. Now, I am launching two new Skin
Frost Highlighters in this collection. One of them is called Summer Snow
cone and she looks something like this. I have been keeping this a secret
from you guys for a while now. I think I’ve worn this on Instagram like
eight times and I’ve never tagged it. And everyone’s like, Girl, what’s
that highlighter, don’t be shady. I always was just kinda
like tip toeing around it. It is a gorgeous yellow, obviously
you guys see, it is YEL-LOW. I’m gonna take my finger real quickly
and show you guys the color. Whoo! It is a beautiful kind of like
medium to pale toned highlighter that just looks so gorgeous
on the cheeks. And there it is swatched. So let’s just put this right here
so you guys can see her in action. I’m gonna take it all
the way to the hairline and bring it right below
the blush and contour. And there is Summer Snow cone. Now of course, I will save this side
of my face for the second shade. This next one is called Crystal Ball.
It is a beautiful icy white, which kinda has like
a duo chrome effect to it, which is kind of like a hue
of like pink to purple. Let me show you.
Let me show you this finger. Alright you guys,
I’m just gonna dive in here. Ooh Girl, I’m like,
don’t play me. Now this one is, I’m just
gonna swatch it right here. It is really stunning. It has like this,
like shape-shifting effect. Alright, so I’m going to use this side of my face
and I’m going to swatch Crystal Ball. Alright cheek bones,
are we ready? I mean, good morning. Now it does have a really
nice pink hue to it and when it hits the light
I think it looks so stunning. Let’s also do a little bit on maybe
the tip of my nose. Whoo. And if you wanna be daring you could
always take another brush, dip in there, a clean brush, and add some highlighter
to your top lip, Girl. Yes. These are the two Skin Frosts. Of course, launching
with the entire collection. Now last but not least, let’s dive
into the Velour Lip Scrubs. This Summer I am launching
3 Velour Lip Scrubs. And they’re in brand new flavors
that I’ve never done before. Now if you are new to my channel or
have never used my Lip Scrubs before, they are infused with Aloe Vera,
they are also edible, they have Vitamin E in them,
and they leave your lips feeling just like soft pillows afterwards. And of course, like I said, you can
eat them, you can lick them. But please do not substitute
them for a meal. Let’s start off with introducing
the first flavor. This is Watermelon Gum. Now, in my current line, Strawberry Gum
is my number one top seller. So, I was like, you know what, how
do I make something as amazing? And I’m like, watermelon is like, oh, I mean,
last year the lipsticks smelled like watermelon. Now this Summer we have
the amazing Lip Scrub. Now of course, they come in these beautiful
chrome packages like everything else. And these ones, you guys, I’m just gonna be honest,
I’m gonna take a little out myself on my finger. Mmm, it is so good. If I didn’t have lipstick on I would
rub it all over my mouth right now. Now this literally, of course you
guys can’t smell or taste it yet, it literally is like bubble gum from
your childhood of just like, the ones that used to look
like little watermelons. If you don’t know
what that means, I don’t even know if they
make that anymore, it’s like very like 90’s,
early 2000’s. But this is so yummy. The second flavor is
Blue Raspberry Sucker. Now you guys know I am such
a sucker for candy and sweets and sugar and
I am obsessed with desserts. Now I love this sugar because
I made it a gorgeous like almost like it’s an icee
from a movie theater, blue. Oh my God, it’s like Sweet Tarts
in your mouth. It is so yummy.
I’m like, hmm, mmm, dessert is served.
And the third and last flavor is Orange Soda. I am such a lover of like orange soda
since I was a child. I love it. It definitely reminds me of Summer.
And of course, you guys know I had to do
the sugar all orange. Now I did use this a lot this week
so this one’s a little well used and, oh my God. So, in the lab I said, hey, I want this
to almost give you like that bubbly, fizzy feeling when you smell it, and it literally
feels like the bubbles of the soda are like hitting your nose when
you smell this one. Mmm. Thank you so much for watching

I love this red It is definitely more of like a dark brick sexy red definitely darker than Red Rum but lighter than unicorn blood now we are going to move on to the dogs so when we Sat here and thought about all the shades we thought about like the dogs entire History my first two dogs diva and diamond I had before me and Nate ever started dating and then delicious and daddy Yeah, we got when we first started dating so about six seven months in we got delicious. Yeah, it was he was the cutest little It's crazy too because he was like almost brown before he turned black which was like the craziest thing Yeah, I met like a really light, but kind of dark almost like a grizzly bear yeah He really did look like a little grizzly Yeah, okay So we're gonna talk about the dogs you guys and then we're gonna swatch one that will go down each color And we'll talk about all the dogs so first up is Deva Deva has been every color of the rainbow now I got Deva you guys eight Years ago long time which is nuts so I never so growing up. I always had cats Nate has Yeah, I've had three four cats plus dogs. You know we've had Birds or everything a lot of animals so I used to have a lot of cats when I was growing up at my grandma's house and When I oh not to be dark But one of my cats from three years old to 14 years old. I had to put down which is so horrible I know a lot of you out there can relate and it broke my heart Oh, and I like about to never get animals again right it sucks fast forward to when I used to sing and go on tour I was on Warped Tour actually 2009 and we're in Indianapolis We were out in like the country like just seeing the city we had a day off and there was like this random Like pet farm in the middle of nowhere Oh wow And we went there and I was like you know what it might be time to get Animal like I really want a dog I never had dogs growing up But they're so loving and caring and amazing and they're just like I was ready at that time in my life to get a dog So insert diva now all the dogs are Pomeranians except, diva I'm sure a lot of you were like why is diva like the Jumbo version of them, and why does his face longer? Pointy snow yeah, so diva is actually he has Fox blood in him as well as full Pomeranians So he is very unique and at first I didn't believe the guy He said well a fox had sex with a dog and maybe he lied Right the folks came in to like their barn or whatever where they had all their palms, and you know yeah You know so I don't know if the guy was lying I mean every vet is like yeah, that's crazy, and they never say he's anything else so if Fox sperm doesn't work with dogs Let me know in the comment section below now let's talk about Deva shade now We know I have a hot hot pink in this brand prom night. This is prom nights Barbie sister It is a more warmer pink, and if you look closely at the swatch and in the bottle it has gold metallic in it It's so pretty now. I can see it really closely yes I love the shade it is so stunning if I used to be paint that was his signature color and when we did it him Pink he blew all over the internet like so people used to write articles about it and people would go crazy about Me coloring the dog somebody has their everyone has their opinion Yeah, the dye is not dye it is basically vegetables It is a vegan formula that coats the hair kind of like this. This is actually vegan Dye your I guess I can lick his hair right and the thing is the dogs think it's like shampoo It's like you're washing the dog with shampoo, and they don't even a lot of misconception Chemicals Anybody's eyes or mouth or anything like that? That's but anyway so long story short I always received a lot of crazy stuff about my dogs. I'm sure you guys have seen a lot of old pictures of them We're gonna throw up a few so dearly used to be pink He's been spotted as you know this picture, and he's done a lot of stuff So I thought that would represent him perfectly now next shade is diamonds Diamond is uh we call her miss thing in this house. She runs the house she does now diamond is a pure white Pomeranian boy yeah boy palm She is a show dog. Just like delicious and daddy and I a man used to be periwinkle and I used to kind of be inspired by like aliens and extraterrestrials and like Sailor Moon so cool And there is this famous picture of diamond let's throw it up right here of her being periwinkle And she has a little bindi on her hand yeah, she is a little people you thought it was the craziest shit Yeah, it was a tiny sticker that lit when I like waiting. I thought I was like what the hell sick Wasn't heavy, it was like air. I didn't even know it was on there No people like but you know how people are yeah animals are not toys. I know they're my family I know, but anyway you guys so this famous picture of diamond went viral all over the Internet And I thought you know what what better way to Match that shade. I don't have a periwinkle color in my collection at all It's a really pretty color, and I really love how it looks with the baby pink you. This is a little history lesson everyone so Diamond I got her a year later after diva, so she is now Seven Diamond has something called alopecia Which if anyone has watched Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Lisa Vanderpump's dog Ziggy? I think that's his name They don't watch TV. Okay, so Lisa Vanderpump's dog has alopecia as well, and she always put sweaters on him I Didn't know she had that so imagine you guys we have this dog totally normal, and then her help isn't effective Thank God well imagine baby three years in yeah, what happened all her hair started falling out. I was so freaked out I was like to shave cancer. Yeah. She's dying does she have like some crazy skin disease. I had no idea That's so crazy. Um and one day there was a clumps of hair on the carpet, and I was like so scared so I Took her to a dog dermatologist now girl back Then when when mama had no coin that doctor was so much money But I was like vets in general are that and especially like tests like that. It's so yes It was close mostly so I took her to a dermatologist and they diagnosed her with alopecia black actually that's what it's called He said there isn't like a hundred percent cure But there's medicines you can give her to make the hair grow back, right? And I'm like oh my god like I don't care. How she looks, but she's a dog. She wants she wants a hair She's gonna be cold They gave her some medicine, and it was a certain type of medicine. It's actually for human cancer patients and A month later white fuzz bomb yeah, and then months later her hair all came back mostly in her belly lot its splotchy in the back of her legs and her but It's splotchy but anyway long story short. That's my dog's medical history. I'm sure a lot of you out there I've seen alopecia dogs or maybe even have one. Let me know in the comment section down below. She's great Hair coming back. Yeah verse two nun is amazing. She's in full health I Haven't dyed her hair since all of it came back Yeah I feel like it's not that's like a bad omen Dai did nothing wrong to her obviously We've dyed them all I just always wanted not every buck with it because I feel like she's been through enough, right It's just harder to grow our hair back So it just it's harder for her to get rid of the pink exactly that is why diamond is This color that is her little history. She's the best thing ever she runs the house. She has a little attitude and Daddys obsessed with her yes. He is what shade is next so next shade. We have here is delicious. Yeah and Delicious his little back story is you know after like about a couple months of us dating wicker We were getting you know more and more serious, so we thought you know maybe we'd get a another poem yeah Get another child a little baby poem so I've never really had baby Pomeranians and puppies, and I was really excited so yeah I was totally down to get a little baby poem a lot of people always have the kind of stigma that Pomerania really Yappy and crazy, and they do and mine Nate was surprised because Deva and diamond were like military like oh, yeah They were really because I worked in a pet store So I dealt with a lot of different types of dogs, and they were never really my fondest breed of breeds So you know Maya neuromas yeah women exactly? I love the dogs so we got delicious, and we wanted to get like the opposite of diamond So we asked each other what color do we want to get and we wanted a pure black one so when we found Delicious he was so cute We're gonna throw some baby pictures of him right now Look out tiny used to be used to fit in the little palm of our hand and he was a little head though He had a big for it, and then he finally grew into his body Yeah But um so at the time when Nate first moved to LA After we had been dating for like nine months and nine ten months right. I'm like that yeah, so before the house We live in now that we buy I lived in another Smaller home, but I had a lot of stairs it was like this three level really cool like I could we used to call it the tree house yeah hanging on the side of The mountain had a bunch of stairs so that when the dogs are little you guys they were freaked out Yeah, it's but delicious him being so so tiny it was really hard for him. He was always whining every time We got to stairs. He would never Julie go down the stairs yeah He would cry yeah, you cry you cry just like a little baby but as Lynn started to grow a little bit and yeah Nate taught him how to walk yeah cutest thing ever after watching that I Was like you know what maybe we will adopt a baby, just kidding, haha It was really adorable the way they like bonded and yeah to show him how to walk down the stairs He couldn't do it. It was really cute Yes, so that you know delicious has a special place in our heart so when we were thinking of making the color We all know I already have a pitch black guy recalled weirdo So that was out of the picture that was already out of the picture so we thought okay? What else and then Nate reminded me that when delicious was so here's the thing you guys Pomeranians have two coats yes? Not for two coats and when they're babies they go through like the puppy uglies is what Maureen like readers called it They said there's baby fur that they have yeah So when his first runner to grow in it was mixed of like like that grizzly bear Charlie yeah, Charlie There's like a dark chocolate, but it was like so fuzzy it almost looked like it was tan. I can't you know It's hard to explain it. It was weird basically looked like this color Yeah
It really did and we thought you know what we got a given homage to his It's like when a baby's eyes turn colors when it's a green in a turn hazel when they grow up That's kind of what happen to his hair. No delicious's personality he he's been mouthing one. Yeah He's the peppy little spit fuck when anyone Comes up to the door if there's a package about to be delivered or the mailman's here, or someone's walking He is the alarm he's gonna let you know let's move on to the sixth and final color Obviously this was gonna be a little bump in the road because we already have a shade called daddy yes We do now you all know the top-selling of many MUA jeffree star cosmetics Collaboration shade daddy, which is almost sold out so if you wanted don't sleep on it We thought well he is the youngest and he is a baby so baby still yeah, so we wanted to name the shade Baby daddy works perfect. I think it's perfect now daddy is a woops table Pomeranian. Yes. He is that? Long beautiful hair it almost looks like a wig. Yeah, okay, it's nicer hair than everybody in this house. I feel like hey He has the most beautiful coat yeah when he plays in the yard. I mean, it's just flowing in the wind yeah it's Very so this is a more of like a nude caramel. It's really rich and it's soft It's almost like a diet posh spice, but a little more warm toned in there daddy is Nathan's that's Nathan's kid He's like my my star child tell everyone. Why when Danny was a puppy I would sleep with him downstairs on the couch almost every night, so we would sleep together tell you what every single night Let me tell you why because our bed is Ginormous, it's too big. It's literally eight feet by 10 feet I'm a little baby palm is too big so we do have stairs that go up to our bed Yes, all the dogs sleep with us daddy including now cuz he's longer He's longer arms arms and limbs now, but all three dogs are accustomed to sleeping in our bed Yeah, so when daddy was little he was not about that. No I feel upstairs. It was Jeff he couldn't get up a still yeah, and then he would cry on the floor, and you know it's it's it's really like having a Little baby, so it's like you know if we would go to sleep He would cry and I know a lot of people gonna make well. You have to crank train Em, and you have to do girl. Let us raise our dogs that we want to raise our daughter Yeah, I mean we been in the same version I just slept on the couch, and it was much closer to the floor much closer to him And he was a lot more calm and can go right to sleep, and he wouldn't cry and keep us up at night But in turn he is now obsessed with me. Yes. He did everywhere Nate walks. He follows me He was already in this room while we've been filming this entire video until right now We took a little water break, and he's probably right outside the door He most certainly probably is let's go grab him yo me, too. Yeah, right? He's a little sleepy. Oh look at that hair. I need look at him. He was like What are all these lights and he's like it's bright in here Danny. Look grumpy look at him. He is so grumpy He's like dad. You don't like all the lights. He isn't like all the lights, and he's not a big person I'm being held he likes being in full control when daddy that I mean well, then Nate sometimes um Daddy hates being held high the other dogs don't care. You can cradle them like infants. He has a little attitude about it It's on the ground though. He's always all smiles, but I think with ten beauty lights He's like girl, and he just woke up in his welcome up first, but daddy is the best hair on earth, okay? So I'm sure everyone's gonna be asking what is the price for the house? So you get all six full-size of liquid lipsticks in this beautiful packaging for $75 you save a lot of money buying them all together But we want to note that you can also buy all six shades Individual individually of course for the standard $18 price, so if you only want a few other colors You can definitely do that so besides that you guys there are a few more products that we wanted to create You know we can't just do a lipstick we have to do some more yeah We you know I love lip scrubs so I was like hey. Let's make a few lip scrub Let's get one going so the velour lip scrubs you guys they of course are vegan. They are edible They are infused with the vitamin E.

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel now if you are a skincare addict you are going to enjoy today's video because we are going to test out the brand new Tarte tight and bright clay multi mask now I've seen this all over Instagram you know people always take crazy map pictures and when I saw this I was like oh my god it's a clay mask and a gel mask in one and I want to see if it works today so I have of course in no makeup on my face I may have woken up this morning with a little bit of mascara right here but hey who doesn't I'm just going to tone my face right now and make sure there's no dirt and oil but this mask looks really exciting so if you want to see if it works or not keep on watching alright so when you unbox it it comes in this a large jar now when I saw this on Instagram I had no idea it was this big so this is definitely bigger than like a normal face mask jar I am going to compare it to the glam glow dream duo only because when you open it there were there was a similarity that I've really never seen before in face masks of course I don't mean that in any type of way I just definitely noticed that this Glanville one I've tried before this is one of the few masks I've seen with a like a duo type of mask thing of course these products are not similar in the way that they work or what they're for but I thought it was interesting but when you compare like this to this you guys like this is this is big I mean what are the ounces though that's probably the realty sometimes don't let size for you this one only has I think 0.20 grams of more product so anywho we are going to of course test this out today now when you open this up you guys can definitely see love the colors for this you have the I'm going to call it lavender I don't think it's like a bit yeah this looks lavender I think it's a lavender clay mask and then you have this gold gel mask so weird of course we're going to go on the website and see what the hell this is actually supposed to do because I have no damn idea so for $40 that is what this retails for you are going to would get 0.88 ounces so it is almost a full ounce but not quite and of course there are two different masks in this thing so on the website let's pull up Sephora home shall we this says you guys it is for normal oily combination dry sensitive it's literally for everyone and this mask is vegan which is awesome they are both are so basically you're supposed to mix match and target skin concerns by tightening pores polishing hydrating and brightening Grum always down for a fucking brightening please this is going to solve our poor areas it is going to help with dryness dullness and uneven texture girls like my whole life has an uneven texture okay so basically this is a custom at-home facial with to target formulas that work in a total harmony to create your skin specific troubles zone by zone both the formulas feature tarts iconic Amazonian clay to restore a gentle skin balance okay so what the hell does the purple lavender one do it detoxifies and purifies the face it is perfect for oily t-zone and shine control and it's going to help tighten pores detox your skin oh wow it's a lot okay now the gold one is a hydrating and firming gel mask ideal for dry or delicate areas like the cheeks and under eyes it is going to calm redness and inflammation so if someone sits on your face for more than 10 minutes I want to use this and then it basically is going to boost my clarity and circulation and supposed to restore my skin's and natural moisture balance for a supple soft and energized look well I think it's time to apply this bad boy so what I want to do is of course I've been running around this morning I'm a bit on the treadmill I'm a bit on my knees so I am going to take this fresh rose deep hydration facial toner and how cool does this look with the rose petals inside I think it looks so cool now this is going to just really leave the skin calming and prep it for a face mask so I love to use these little cotton circles and I just pour a little bit on here and just remove all excess oil that I have accumulated throughout the day now before I applied a mask I always put on eye cream right before because I never put masks fully up to of course the lash line your skin around your eyes is a very sensitive it's a lot more delicate than the rest of the skin on your face so I'm going to go in with the tatcha deep hydration firming eye serum I love this because it has this clay applicator and it just feels really cooling when you put it on so I'd love to just let the eye cream settle in and then apply the mask how to it says to apply the purple mask wherever you want to tighten pores and minimize shine apply the gold mask where I want to hydrate so it says to leave on for 10 to 20 minutes and then rinse well I'm sure with a warm washcloth to remove it all so I have to face masks brushes here that I use whenever I apply face masks do you need a face mask brush I mean I want to apply all that with my fingers so yes you do alright so for purple we want to tighten and minimize the shine so we were going to take this the clay one is like thick I love it and let's put it in our t-zone area and a little on the pores now we're going to go into the gold side and we're going to put this where we want to brighten in where I'm just feeling a little dull so basically all over my body and I'm just going to oh wow when I saw the gold metallic I wasn't sure what it was going to feel like it is very gel like it is not this is not a metallic peel off this is definitely a very gel like feeling now it feels kind of cooling I'm just going to avoid where I put the eye cream all right so the mask is all on the face now I'm a weirdo where I like to take some of the product and do a little bit like on my neck area I mean hi who wants their neck to age or look old not this bitch and I'm going to let this sit for 15 minutes and I will be right back alright you guys we are 5 minutes and I'm actually zoom in on my face a little bit here now obviously I don't think this is a negative because it's a face mask and it like a lot of my other clay masks crack but you could tell when I was going like mm-hmm girl I look like I'm in Lord of the Rings right now all right you guys so it has been 15 minutes I'm going to run to the sink which is behind this camera and I'm going to wash this off but I do want to say that this feels really hard like my pores better looks a little different after this because this feels like really hard clay look at that woo girl it's look at its cracking oh look at that woo and then this oh it kind of dried yeah I did dry look you guys it really did huh where's all my finger oh my god if I owned dry skin in case anyone was wondering great so I need some lotion and it's off be right back alright you guys so I'm going to quickly do a little zoom in on my face right now the gold part of the mask came off really easy the clay mask it did dissolve with hot water please ignore my inspected pour I know you guys are like what the fuck oh I've sugar on my mouth come on lip scrub I do have I didn't have a break out here you guys saw that when I try to the Laura Mercier foundation girl it's like still here I'm like boom but um so there was a little bit of redness here where the clay was barely though I mean that's kind of normal with some masks now let's see if my pores look any different that's going to be the real question so I'm just going to take a compact here okay so I'm looking at my face and I'll be really honest I really don't see that much of a difference for my pores like at all obviously you know sometimes you do need to use masks several times but just from like the very first initial like wiping it off like my pores look pretty much the same now my skin does feel nice where the gold is it kind of feels like a little bit of a texture you guys see the shine that's happening right here definitely did something to my skin so it feels a little more like I feel something I may be and then your pores look any different I gotta ask the person that Facebook's me every day yeah how do you look pretty much what do you think a real normal real quickly so tight I think the honest they look the same size to me yeah I mean I didn't didn't go anywhere hahahaha alright thanks baby I mean if you stare at me everyday I just really had to ask really quick yeah let me you like you baby thank you okay you guys so I definitely don't like to approve skin care if it isn't like a quick fix or something that you have to use over time I don't really think it's fair I think that the mask is fun I love base maps in general it's always fun to just like let your skin have a moment and it kind of is almost like a psychological thing where you're like oh my god maybe my pores are her tighten maybe they are to me looking in the mirror in front of me I don't see that much of a difference my skin is a little red still and it's been like ten minutes so that hopefully that goes away you can also see kind of like red splotchiness right here who knows what that is doing is it extracting is it doing something I guess we will have to see I will leave my final thoughts in the description box now let you know what happened later that night to see if the redness is still there I'm soon no but hey you never want to assume yeah you guys I think that when it comes to skin care there's not going to be a Jeffrey Stehr approved moment unless it is something that I can really know if it works right away so I don't think that that's fair so the tart type and bright face mask was cool actually kind of like the gold more the clay was almost like too hard it almost like I didn't hurt but it was like really intense more than usual so my skin is like girl give me some damn moisture okay I guess we are done for this video thank you guys so much for watching another one of my crazy first impressions and of course I'll see you on the next one mwah bye guys 
[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I am so excited to talk about a collaboration that has been in the works for months and it's finally about to see the light of day we are going to talk about the GA cosmetic jeffree star collaboration I am so excited to reveal everything and there is even a tutorial in this video so after I talk about the product we meaning lipstick Nick my makeup artist is here for today's video and we're going to show you how to create this wild candy cotton candy fantasy now let's jump into the collaboration earlier this year I actually broke my virginity of having a discount code for a makeup company you all know if you've been watching my channel for a while and very against having codes for me personally I don't care what my friends do it that's obviously how a lot of youtubers and makeup artists make money they offer discount codes for products I've always been someone that I never wanted a code I've never taken money to review a product I always want to be a hundred percent really real from me to you guys and that's just how I feel but I did team up with you a cosmetics earlier this year and I got my first ever coat for one purpose only and that purpose was to give back and to team up with a charity so we have teamed up with the LGBT Los Angeles center here in California and every earning that I made from the code early this year has been donated to them and now I just want to talk about it before we unveil the amazing a lip topper now before we unveil and talk about everything I do want to say that the proceeds from this entire collaboration will be going to charity so I'm actually not keeping a dollar I am a very blessed and fortunate to have five other businesses that do so astronomically well that I wanted to team up with in a brand that believed in me and a brand that I believed in who was willing to do something for charity and just help me show my vision so I am really really excited to talk about this today means relay Cosmetics have had a really great relationship I love their products they have amazing liquid lips and highlighters but their star product in my eyes is their amazing lip toppers none of these have coconut oil in them the formula is like this just be you can wear these alone or on top of a lipstick right now I'm sure most of you have seen these in with some of my favorites videos or you've seen them in tutorials but here are a few of their lift Stoppers these are unbelievable I am such a fan of the tan line skinny dip frostbite rose gold they're just an amazing product now I'm someone where of course we all know I do have my own brand I would rather team up with a another brand and do an amazing thing with their product rather than try to create the same exact thing I think there are so many brands out there that are being innovative and cool let's all support each other so as you guys can see today I am wearing the lip topper that I created with Joey on my mouth so when you get the product here is the beautiful baby pink chrome box knavish your weight has never really changed their packaging colors before even on top of their components so I thought that it was really cool that they were willing to go the extra mile of course you see the little Geoffrey sort of signature on here under the logo and they have sprinkled the box with stars everywhere we even have the JSE logo on the side all here of course it's Hollow and it's on the top as well and of course the name of the product is sweet tooth and it is right on the top so once you open it you see that of course normal joy products have a black top sweet tooth comes with a baby pink chrome top with the of course logo right there BAM I just want you guys to really look at the product in the vial it is so glittery and beautiful and blinding and this is actually as your ways first time putting this much glitter in a product I was like you guys know your calabria Jeffrey sorry to turn up the

know I'm infamous for the damn hand swatches let's dive into it skin tight is a very peachy nude it is a very pale now I've been wearing the lip mo for a long time and on my girl we need it in a liquid lip so I'm gonna take these now you know although this is not gonna be the best swatches on the planet I'm not doing no tape no nothing I'm just showing you exactly what the color looks like so there is skin tight now if you are someone who have used my liquid lips before there's no explanation needed but if you are new my liquid lips are vegan they are cruelty free they are paraben and gluten free and they are also very full coverage they're very light on the mouth so it really feels like you're not really wearing much and of course they are long lasting if you're gonna eat oily foods I definitely recommend grabbing it and taking it with you because oil will remove most or if not all liquid lips alright next shade is mannequin of course I am wearing it on my mouth but we're still gonna swapped her on my hand real quick this is a darker shade than skin-tight of course you're about to see in a second BAM and there is I'm gonna try to make it the same width because my brain is like a little more there we go alright so there is mannequin MA next up is celebrity skin this is one of the top selling shades of all time for my brand right below and drogyny and this looks good on every single skin tone it is in the more dark family so it's a little darker than mannequin as you can see on my hand let me bring it all the way back there we go it is a shade darker so if mannequin is too light for you it definitely go up and do celebrity skin or use it with a lip liner and put some in the middle baby mmm next up is posh spice which is like a Grey's nude it has more of a grey tone to it it's kind of a little more eat the roll I love this color let's swatch it I think when I first came out with this I wore this for like a month straight could not take it off I just love the tone of this one as you can see it is darker than the previous three next up is a rose madder which you all know I've used this shade in so many videos I love it it has a different tone it's not your typical nude but it's definitely in the nude family oh girl I am obsessed and I kind of feel weird saying I'm obsessed with this color because it is my own brand but maybe I'm obsessed next up is Gemini and I know this is so many people's favorites like I see this tagged all the time this is a more of a warm tone almost like a peachy celebrity skin and I think this shade looks flawless on anyone alright now next up is Leo which of course we just mentioned and this one is such a beautiful warm terracotta nude this looks so beautiful on medium to dark skin tones and let's swatch her my hands running out of room but you guys will get the gist sorry for these swatches I know they are a little weird and unconventional but hey the hand works so as you see it is a little darker than these three and I just love the undertone last but not least is Enduro Janee this was one of my favorite shades of all time and it has been like number one ever since I put it out it doesn't matter what color I put out this is still top seller it's insane so of course we are going to swatch androgyny right here this is such a cool dark plum Mavi type of nude and you guys have made this such a hit so thank you so much for supporting androgyny so here all eight of the minis swatched I know a lot of you have these shades already and if you don't this is a perfect time to grab them and try

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] my life [Music] going on oh look at here my favorite two patient we're glad they are here with three patient is this kindnesses nice brother - how are you is here from wall support yeah you may drive us home we'll see you know calm and how can I help you guys Pepsi today mates go first ok tell us what's going on over here sweatin like crazy ok why is that so no there's got to be the jeans it's something because we going off for a long time oh yeah no I mean I can sit down on the couch a search button ok mostly an axle on market mostly a target a few comments here and there randomly ok saying I spend some you know ok you have that no leakage are in hillock vacuum of square on the living room and what yeah it's ridiculous yeah and especially with summer approaching is going to be hot too literally will jump on we're not in Michigan anymore now it's going to be hundred degrees and you're my type of problems yeah fair enough the conditions called hyperhidrosis I'm exceedingly common hyper meaning above and hydrosis being just sweat so you have to pay you know above normal amount of sweat it's not pathological and not dangerous if it doesn't bother you it doesn't bother me but it sounds like it bothers you a little video so there's a couple options I would some people the simplest option is often the best choice in this case what I recommend and it might not crazy to you is we inject a little bit of neuromodulator in there a little bit of Botox in the armpits but it sounds right knee a little great then I was like little house leg majority what happens is sweat is secreted by muscle and little tiny microscopic muscles push the sweat out so by temporarily paralyzing those muscles you don't sweat and when you don't sweat it you don't smell so you what are you mean typically it's pretty remarkable but with a few injections in each armpit takes about a week to kick in you'll have 95 to 100 percent eliminated for about a year blows my mind yes we all now the only thing is it it's a weird procedure a kid I can imagine yeah how does that work so what we need to do is shave your armpits that we have to put on an iodine color okay we dab on cornstarch and then you need to sweat so we need to come up with a way means by which we can get you to sweat then we are going to notice a dark visualization a navy blue color where the sweat interacts with the iodine in the cornstarch and they'll be able to see exactly what your economic glands are we sweat going and then we're going to check right into them Wow interesting 30 down for that I'm down let's do this let's do it we need your happy reset worked on competitors all the exact does everybody like Daddy or he's like we're better then we wanted to remove the hair just so we can really visualize the area that we're going to treat they have a little bit of irritation here it's probably nothing more than mechanical and what we're going to do is we're going to clean this area really well with alcohol we're going to cover it with iodine and then cornstarch and then we have a connection 12 years of formal training I'm an associate clinical professor of dermatology at two different medical schools I'm on editorial advisory board to peer-reviewed journals and right now shaving Nate's armpit this is much more than just iodine okay once the iodine is dry we paint the cornstarch over the iodine and we're gonna be able to see we will visualize it this may turn me on blue or purple almost wherever you started sweat and you can see it oh wow look at that I mean oh wow this side works perfectly we're gonna have to do this side again or actually have them start sweating so we just need to sweat now great all right Nate what do we have made news going back you want to run on a stream yeah but I got to hold my arms up up yeah come on all right what about mating to light down without into the block and then run back to the jewelers that little Berkshire yeah all right plenty laughing don't get into a free show yeah okay you can do it that's exactly what I want to see long oh that looks crazy ready to inject and once I get in there I'll circle anymore okay great why don't you say goodbye to those nappy our pizzas we're getting rid of that they look good on you thank you God we have a beautiful visualization of where this eccrine glands are I'm ready to inject I just need to clean this demarcate where the needles need to go series of little pinches and then you'll be done a little bit quarters I'm sorry I think I'm good Oh everybody's a comedian okay here we go so this is right where Whoopi and business a little griddling is it really helps me space with the injection site we're just cleaning up the area removing some of that start some of that iodine so that we have a clean slate - objection - we shave the area clean it with iodine use the cornstarch to visualize where you're at crime sweat glands are and now time to inject so with your permission I'll get started writing I'm ever gonna be yeah you're not going to set that I promise you will pinch sorry sorry when I open a couple more little pinches okay full of fusion nice and comfortable mm-hmm this is it three groups of people that request this procedure one is people who have to work in hot climates within nice clothes so as an example have a lot of people who come to seeing from Palm Springs for real estate agents they're going to be showing houses and how to candy and they don't want to sweat in from the client the other one which is very timely because the Oscars just occurred we have a lot of actresses who wear strapless gowns and they don't want to show their armpits with the other anonymity and then third category is people like you me who just want gorgeous armpits is that done with one side head of that field not too bad at all not terrible i the initial pension and doesn't feel like there's anything in my armpit doesn't feel like even anything went in it's not you can relax I'm pretty much done torching it I'm gonna clean up in a second I'll let's do this I tripped over yeah I'm ready [Music] Nate I'm not torturing you I just want to clean up a little bit and then you're going to be on your merry way yay a consulate yeah link you go neuromodulators take a couple days to kick in so about four days from now you're going to wake up and you're going to go through your normal routine you're going to brush your teeth you go okay so talk to me to put on yet oh I don't need to prompt you ever know you're really a like three operation now you're going to notice you don't need to do it anymore tonight can't wait you're going to really it's the weirdest thing it's so weird Nate I'm done torturing you your armpits look absolutely gorgeous what questions do you have for me I think I'm great you keep them looking beautiful and you know don't be afraid to go out maybe Venice Beach this number just flexes yeah nice to see you my daddy too [Music] gender what's happening to the oh right so it's been about a year since the last time so I feel like I was losing a little bit of volume I just want that external drama for 2015 so let's let's go I like to be anatomically correct yeah and go area by area let's take a look together your nasal columns and your filter they're beautiful and they make excellent and they frame a nice Cupid's bow right here yeah Vermilion border is really nice we can always shop in that ever-so-slightly on both sides but it looks really good okay you're a little flat in the front here so we always could consider building a little typical but they look really voluminous and yet and what's really important is the lower lip needs to always have a higher volume in the upper lip the ratio should be about one to two or more specifically if you really want to get granular one two 1.618 okay and your volume you have a nice little subtle concavity or your tubercle fits in all things considered it look really good I mean you want to make sure that I see what you see right if you want to go oh look you in a room named Porter's field Harper I think I'm gonna wipe this off I just want it a little over drop today and then we'll look through the real truth you're a little flat upfront but not bad at all volume down below again look straight is it the Vermilion border here you want just a little sharper a little bit yet and maybe a little in here okay so this is the belly of the lip yeah and you're pretty voluminous there but we certainly can put a little bit okay come on what questions you have take up there little down here I know I like the bottom lip I think it looks great I think just a little so where'd you see I'm pretty juicy already but let's put a little bit and we'll stop and always take a log here cool I need to get you end up because yeah well so we're going to put on the lemon cream okay here leave it for about 30 minutes okay wipe it off and that's going to take away 50% of the pan thank god that's perfect and this is the final result No so we're going to design it for what like wearing at less than 39 it's just simply not going to work and as you know the parlament ation is uncomfortable so yes up to you I'd recommend a 30-minute session animal okay perfect do another cream for about 30 minutes let's go ahead and wipe it off okay starts perfect I'm feeling down wow they look amazing I'm so glad we did it it needs a little extra something for the new year but they look amazing I'm so glad to hear you say that it's always great seeing my favorite ocean yeah and when you with jeffree star cosmetics when you buy that island which is probably six eight months away yes please come visit during a groans a row taps on islands that's all you do that I don't want to buy that it is only a few [Music] 
What’s up everybody,
welcome back to my channel. Today we are doing my March
Holy Grails and Fails. Now, February flew by, you guys. I know I did not do a February Favorites
or any type of video like that. I don’t even know what
happened to February.  It just vanished, it went by in a flash. I just remember blinking and all of a sudden,
it’s about to be April and I’m like, I can’t, I can’t breathe. So, in today’s video we’re going to talk about
some of my favorite make-up products, some of my favorite fashion items, and I’m also going to talk about a few products that
 I tried last month that didn’t really work out for me. But besides that, you guys, recently some life changes
have been happening with me and Nathan. We hired a personal trainer. Oh my God,
Mama is trying to get a little bit more fit. I kind of slacked off of working out half of last year and I just miss the feeling of working out
 and having real energy throughout the day and not always needing energy
drinks or that type of bullshit. So, I’m back on my health kick and
I just feel mentally better as a person. A lot more, even just happier with life.
I think that fitness is so important. I think I want to make a separate video
about weight issues and insecurities. Let me know if you guys want that. Because when I did the video where
Nicole covered all of my tattoos there were so many people just being
like really evil and crazy about, oh my God, you look too skinny,
you look too this, you look too that, and I’m like, really, we’re still, like,
 really going in on people that hard? Now, personally, I’m really happy
with myself and how I look. Of course, how others view
me is how others view me. But I think it really brings up a different topic
of self-worth, individuality, weight issues, whether you are overweight or underweight,
 and just how society judges us. So, I definitely kind of want to just sit and
turn the camera on over the next few days and maybe just kind of talk about stuff. So, if you guys would be interested in that
type of video, let me know down below. So, recently, like literally a few days ago,
 I just got back from Necker Island which is owned by Richard Branson. Oh my God, I’m sure you guys saw the SnapChat was lit
 from so many different YouTubers and beauty influencers. I went with Benefit Cosmetics
and I got to take Nathan. We filmed an entire vlog for my channel so that
 will be up hopefully in the next week or two. And it was just really fun. Everyone was there. Manny, Nikita, Gabriel, Patrick, Nikkie,
like literally everyone was there, on a tiny little island in the middle
of nowhere. It was wild. So, if you want to see all of my adventures
that will be on my channel soon. And besides that, you guys, a few days ago,
me and Nathan just had our two-year anniversary. Holy shit, I feel like we literally
just met and I don’t know, I’m kind of having like this reminiscent just moment
of the first time me and Nathan ever locked eyes and we met. I just felt like he was like an old
 friend and I literally, I don’t know, like my heart and my body and my whole
entire soul was just like so like comfortable and he’s probably one of the only people in my entire
life that has genuinely loved me entirely for just me and two years has gone by in a flash.  It was really cool to celebrate our
 anniversary on the island as well. Also, we are literally one week away from
the Manny MUA/Jeffree Star Cosmetics collaboration. It is around the corner. I am so excited
for you guys to see everything and just touch it and
feel it and play with it. If you guys haven’t seen the reveal  yet and you’ve
been busy, you can check it out on Manny’s channel. Of course, I’m going t
o link that down below. But yeah, the first make-up item that
I’m going to be talking about today is no other than the Anastasia
Beverly Hills Nicole Guerriero Glow Kit. Now, I did a review on this almost a month
ago, and you guys really loved the review. It was really fun to see everyone
just excited about highlighting. You guys know I am the highlighting god. And I just, I don’t know,
I love bathing in highlight. Now, this palette alone,
it speaks to my soul. Now, I’ve got to be really real
with you guys, nothing new here. Kitty Kat might be hitting pan soon because
I’ve been using her a lot recently.  I love layering this with my Ice
Cold or with any other highlighter. I swear to God, it’s like amplified
to the extreme. And this one, though, I’ve been using Forever
Lit on the brow bone and the inner corner. It is one of my favorites.
I think that this palette is really versatile.  I know that so many of you have been loving
it so I definitely had to put this Number One. I love this palette. Now, let’s move onto something
a little more glossy. Now, this is on my lips right now.
Bam! This is from Chanel.  Now, their lip-glosses have been probably
one of my favorite formulas just throughout the last few years because it is
very lightweight. It is not sticky. It’s almost like a wet type of feeling
that just kind of goes away. There’s really no crazy
fragrance on this one. Now, this is like a beautiful, golden, glittery type of clear
gloss and this shade is called Melted Honey.  Oh, I love that name.  Now, I am wearing this over nothing. These are just my bare lips,
no liner, no lipstick. But this over a lipstick though,
or like a light liner, is e-very-thing.  I know I don’t talk about glosses
 a lot. I am a matte queen. But this one though is just… .... fabulous. Alright, the next item is from the brand Farsali,
and this is their make-up primer serum.  It is amazing. I don’t know what it is. This is like magic in a bottle. When you put it on and rub it in all over your face, wait
a second, put your foundation on, and it is so snatched. Like, I’ve had this make-up on for like seven
 to eight hours, and my skin looks amazing. Now, I love this brand, I can’t wait
to see what they put out next. Let me know if anyone
has tried this down below. Not much to say about it except it is amazing
 as a primer and that’s what I use it for. I think I’m in love. Next up is from the brand
ICONIC LONDON. These are the Illuminator Drops. Now, they are blinding. Now, the other day I literally wore moisturizer and
this lip-gloss and I mixed this with the moisturizer  and it just gave my face this
all over like hue of like metal. I was feeling very Tin-man,
very snatched. And in case you guys have
never seen these in action, I talked about these in a video called, “Instagram
made me buy it” which I will put down here. These are everything you guys. Let me just demonstrate
a little bit on my hand. Hi there. Now, a little goes a long way. So, I’m just going to take two fingers here and
I mean, hi, do we need to say any more anyone?  I mean, this is just great for,
by itself, in a moisturizer,  in your foundation, you can drop it on your
cheeks and buff it out with a beauty blender. It is very versatile. And you know what’s crazy, is literally
 the day that I posted the video, I talked about how I wish they made other shades
 and they literally put out two shades that same day. Coincidence? Yes God. So, there also is a few more
shades and hopefully they expand. The next next item is…Bam! This is a blush called Bumpy Ride
from the brand NARS. Now, I’ve been wearing NARS
since high school. Oh my God, I just got
highlighter all over that. This blush is really, really gorgeous. It is very soft and peachy which I know everyone
has been into those colors lately, including myself, and I love a denim moment with some
 peach blush. I mean, it is everything.  Now, these blushes are a little
bit on the pricey side. So, of course there are other
dupes for, you know, this brand,  but I feel like if you can get the real thing, get the fucking
real thing, because this formula is bomb. It blends and melts into
the skin, it’s not chalky.  Probably one of my favorite
blush formulas ever. And, not that any of you are shocked,
a little product placement here. But my Androgyny palette
has to be in my favorites. It has been out for almost two months now
and the response has been so incredible. I love seeing everyone’s looks. If you’re on Instagram, hashtag Jeffree
Star Cosmetics so I can see all your looks. I love reposting everyone. But, my palette, you guys, I’m going
to open her up because she is worn in. I love seeing pans that
are really worn in. Now, this one I’ve been using for contouring
 my face and this for highlighter. I don’t know what it is
you guys, but greens,  I’m wearing Military right
here in the crease. I’ve just been loving greens lately. Definitely different from
what I normally do. But this palette just means something
so special to me as the second palette  that I’ve ever created and just so see you
 guys love it so much is just so unreal. So, thank you guys so much. And, I might have another eyeshadow
palette launching in the Fall.  We’ll see. Alright, now let’s dive into
some fashion items. Now, sunglasses. If you’ve been watching my channel for a while you
 know that I always put sunglasses in my favorites.  I’m obsessed with them. Not also
 for any looks but for anti-aging. Whenever I’m driving in the car
I always have sunglasses on. I’ll look over at someone and
when the sun’s hitting their face or it’s bright out I always see people squinting
 and I’m like, Hah, them crow’s feet, girl! Not today. So, recently, Gucci just put out
some new sunglasses. First of all, the case, though,
that teal velvet. I’m like, I love. Kind of matches
my eyeshadow too. Now, these glasses I’ve been
wearing a lot lately. Let me just put these on for
y’all just for a minute please. Why are they so cute? If you’re not into big glasses and you think these
look ridiculous, you can fast forward to the next item. But for someone that appreciates
huge glasses, I live for these. The Swarovski crystal border is
kind of everything, let’s be real. I just love obnoxious fashion,
I think they’re so fun. And maybe these might not be for everybody
but definitely… maybe they were made for me. No, but I just love outrageous things and they’re
really fun and given me a lot of 60s vibes. And I don’t know, anything pink, though you
 guys know, if it’s pink, I’m going to buy it. So, Nathan’s here real quickly  because we have something that we’ve been using
 for a few months and everyone’s like, what the fuck?  Our iPhone 7 Plus cases we’ve
put kind of all over the internet. Yeah, they’re pretty tight. And we are obsessed with them. And they are from Louis Vuitton and
 we have three of them here today. Of course, Nathan got the dude version. Yeah, the black and grey The Eclipse as they call it.
Yeah, Monogram is solid.  and I got the reverse Monogram. I used that for a lot of March and then I recently
 just got this gold crocodile and I fucking live for it. It is so heavy. Yeah. Explain to them…you could
use this as a weapon probably. I’m going to Naomi Campbell
someone if you come for me. This is a brick. Yeah. Whenever anyone sees it they’re like,
“Oh my God, can I see that?” And I like throw it and they’re... and you’ve got
to remember it’s like… this thing is like… It’s huge. It’s quite big. It’s like… Look at my face.
You can’t even see it any more. Exactly. It’s like…
 A bit heavy. Yeah, it's like literally, it took our
wrists a few days to get used to it. Yeah, like, being able to grip it, And when you’re in bed laying on
the pillow and you’re up… oh my God. You have to double hand or you’re like… If this drops on your face, Mama’s going
to need some extra thick concealer for the day. Alright. But yeah, I love these. Of course, a lot of people ask,
 “Where do you buy Louis Vuitton?” Girl, the only place to buy Louis Vuitton
is at Louis Vuitton. So, if you want these, I know
that they’re floating around. They sold out so quickly so I know
that they’re really hard to find. And they’re also really pricey
for a dumb cellphone case. So, I know a lot of people are like,
 “You don’t need that bullshit.” You don’t need anything
in life except food and water. Right. But I'm..... And maybe some love. But I’m obsessed with these and
 hopefully they put out more soon. Yeah, I’m ready. Last fashion item.
No shoes. Backpacks. You guys know I’m a handbag whore, but backpacks
have been speaking to my soul lately.  I don’t know why when I’m travelling I’m
loving just throwing things on my back instead of carrying a heavy-ass
purse all the time. So, recently Chanel just put out
this beautiful classic backpack.  Now, I just love Chanel. When I was a little girl I always
dreamed of carrying Chanel bags. I would watch Sex and the City and
be like, “Oh my God, I just want one.”  But now that I am a handbag collector
I am obsessed with these types of items. They are like pieces of art to me. I don’t take these for, eh, it is what it is.
Like, to me, this like speaks to me. They’re just like, I don’t know, I just
 love collecting, I am definitely a collector. But this backpack is perfect
for travelling, for on the go, for all those long flights that Mama been
taking a lot recently. And I’m obsessed Alright guys, now we are going to talk about
a few items that kind of failed for me last month. And every product that I mention
throughout this year that is a fail,  I will always explain why and
why it didn’t work out for me.  If you had a great experience
 with this product, congratulations, you definitely saved money
by not ever using it again. So, the first product I am going to be talking
about today is the Kylie Cosmetics Kylighters. Now, you guys know, I mean look at my face,
I am a blinding highlighter lover.  When I tested these out on my channel there
was such crazy feedback and opinions. A lot of you were like, “Look, the packaging
is just not stunning. It looks cheap. The highlighter was not
blinding for $22. And I totally understood all of those
concerns. I had the same issues. Now, this one is Strawberry Shortcake. I love the pink hue to this but it
just really wasn’t blinding for me. And then of course the Banana Split one which
was talked about a lot on my channel. It was cute. They’re just not blinding
and I think for $22  there is definitely a lot of other products
out there that work a lot better. But if you’re someone that likes a subtle glow, these
will probably work for you. But for me, it was a fail. Alright, my second and last fail, oh Lord Jesus,
this is the Too Faced Chocolate Chip palette.  I’m going to use the word palette
loosely, because this thing is so tiny. Now, when I saw this online I got the illusion that maybe
it was like bigger, like their Chocolate Bar palette. Or maybe slightly larger,
I’m not sure what I expected. But when I got this
in the mail I was like… It’s like when you finally hook up with a hot
guy you’ve been wanting for a long time and you unzip his pants and it’s like...
is that all? That’s kind of the moment that I had
with this motherfucking product. So, let me open her up. Now, look. When I saw this you guys,
I immediately was like, am I doing the “Full face using
only kids’ make-up challenge”? Because this looks tiny! Look how small those pans are.
And here’s the main problem. Let me get a brush and let me just tap. So, let me just tap into this shade
right here once or twice. There is so much fallout it’s unreal. Every shade you guys
is literally just like… oh my God, can you see
that with my lighting? Let me just click it
a few more times. It is intense. The one good thing about it is,
oh, it smells really yummy. Like most of their products now,
they all smell bomb as fuck. But the actual formula and the product
itself, I’m not really loving it.  It’s like, you can definitely create a full
 look out of here, it’s just a lot of lights. It’s like these two all kind of look
like the same shade to me. And they threw in the classic
white and the black. But, nah, it fell really flat for me
 and that fallout, I’m like, (coughs),  I literally taste the like the powder in my mouth right
 now which, kinda yummy, but maybe dangerous. Besides, that you guys, those were
 my only disappointments for last month. There was a lot of amazing things. I also tried out a lot of stuff and if I don’t use something
 more than once I really don’t talk about it again. Unless, like, if I review it and I hate it,
it’s going in the make-up archives. And one day I’ll do a make-up tour, I promise. Alright you guys, thank you so much for
watching my March Holy Grails and Fails. I am really excited to dive into April. I’m so excited
for my collab with Manny to come out. And we’re about to start off Spring

this one alright so in this box you guys you get matte liquid lipsticks you have pressed powder highlighters you have oh my god you guys there's her velvet liquid lips there is super glitter glosses which is a new formula I can't wait to try those there is a brand new eyeshadow palette there is a face duo there is loose powder highlighters oh my god I think I'm going to try the highlighters first now there are several types in this collection so something that I wore the other day on snapchat and online was something called the wet set now this says on the back of the box that it is a pressed powder highlighter okay so let me open this up there are four shades BAM and as you see I did try this one the other day it's called privacy please it was blinding so before we even get into it I'm going to tell you my first impression because I did try this this is the only thing I've tried in the box I was look at the formula it is not a normal pressed powder highlighter even though it says it all in there it has a almost like a cool to touch cream feeling let me show you my clean finger here and let me just dive into privacy please you see one two one two blinder oooh that's how I feel when I saw this and I might as well just watch the other ones for you this one is unbothered oh my god I mean look at that it's like mirrors on my finger and then we have do-not-disturb which is this guy look at that guy's all the tones are so different we got champagne we got a pinky one and we got a bronze one and then the third one get away is the more dark do bronze with like gold glitter oh my god just feel so cool so here is all four shades from the wet set and by the way I love that name now I did see some people on snapchat really like go in here and press it hard like putty and you can press it and see I don't want to do it too hard because I don't want to ruin it so as you see you guys you can see my finger imprints so it is like a I don't even know how to explain it it's like literally a powder and a gel and a cream all in one but it dries like this and it's not like tacky a lot of the times you guys just see me on my channel use cream highlighters and it just has that weird tacky feeling and you have to set it this is not the case this just looks stunning now here's my only issue is that this for four shades is $62 I'm my girl Kylie's trying to use them luxury prices all decided another formula is probably a little more expensive that is just my guess I do not know that for a fact and you know she isn't that middle tier price point but 62 dollars for four shades I was like for the entire bundle of stuff that I just showed you you can get everything for $250 of course if you're a makeup collector or an addict you are going to love that price it is discounted if you only want a few things from a collection obviously I understand that $250 is a lot of money for a collection everything comes in the bundle except the wet set so just want to put that out there I know a lot of you are going to be wondering and asking so before we move on I think it's only fair that we swatch with you on my cheeks because girl I'm kind of obsessed are you guys so I'm going to take this little highlighting brush from heaven 'upon I I'm going to go in with privacy please ignore my of course fingermark and all I'm going to do is go like that like BAM so let me just put it right on the line of my cup contour well I mean um what is once the other day and now is my second time using it and let me just say the catchphrase at me and Manny made famous I sure I'm really shook look at that I mean look at that girl now I am gonna go in with Do Not Disturb which is a more pink champagne like color same brush now that the color is off right so I just put my hair behind my ears to see you guys can visually see a little bit more don't hate a knife Sephora clip y'all let's see what it looks like oh I'm like feeling the burn honey I don't want to sound like a broken record you guys but I really really love this formula I know I said the price point was a little crazy but I think for how blinding they look right away I would definitely buy this myself damn that is beautiful huh alright the next item I really had been dying to try out is they take me on vacation I shadow palette this is it's different I heard allegedly Kylie did talk about on snapchat that this is her best collection today she said thank you for dealing with a lot of my trial and errors I've really perfected this and I'm very proud of this collection and this is my proudest collection I guess since she started her brand which I love that she is open to improving and she has acknowledged I think that it's so cool so here is the palette those shades though yo those shades so for $52 you get 16 shades and of course they look like this so I have primed my lids off-camera with the Mac painterly paint-pot of course I do that every video i prime eyelid so it's only fair that we do it before we try out a palette so I'm going to take shade first class it is a pale matte lavender and I'm going to put that all over my lid here and let's see what it looks like [Music] okay so right off the bat you guys this formula is amazing I definitely think they are a little bit a more easier to blend in the previous palette I think my only issue with the Kylie cosmetics shadows has been the metallics in the past have been a little underwhelming and definitely I've seen improvements so of course we're going to try it we got try at that blue y'all I want to smoke out my lashline so now I'm going to go in with this matte to have a slate gray color called on the rocks or just gonna use a little Mac blending brush and put that right in my crease and blend out alright now we're going to take this matte chocolate brown shade called palm tree and we are going to put a little bit in the crease and just darken it a hair alright now if you've been watching my channel for a while you know that I'd love to take really light shades and put them on the brow bone I'm a little scared to try this this is called a loja it's like a peachy matte shade and what I mean scared I just mean that I am very fair so I don't want it to look too crazy on my lid so I'm going to take a clean brush and we're going to play with it we'll try half the eye or in case it's too dark all right you guys Aloha is tucked in there I kind of love these two color combos together I'm living so far so we are going to dip into shade island girl which is of course this stunning electric blue color I'm going to use a Tom Ford a little pencil brush and we're just going to coat the brush I did see Kylie on snapchat wet the brush for some of the metallic we can definitely try that on my channel but I want to coat the brush completely before I wet it just to see how it works on its own the brush is coated let's see if it works all right now you guys know I'm the realest bitch on YouTube Kylie I love you this blue one it's a litter and by shear I mean it's sheer honey its sheer not a bad thing some people do like a soft look but if you're going to do a blue shadow bitch you better do a damn blue shadow okay let me just wet my brush let's take this back in the palette and let's close the brush while it's damned okay and now let's see what happens I'll write you guys I will say that once I wet the brush with six-plus it applied really nice I think by itself it was a little subtle so if you're someone that doesn't want an intense crazy blue look can definitely use it dry but I think it definitely needed the fix plus alright now for a little inner corner action I want to use a soft champagne peachy color this one's called a summer 17 or right here and let's just pop this right in here it definitely goes well with the blue but to me I want a little bit more intensity so we're gonna wet the brush again oh girl there we go so wetting the brush with the metallics definitely is a big help you guys know if I was like mm-hmm I would tell y'all but I mean it is very common nowadays for the world to own a setting spray and to bump up you know the pigment as you guys can see she's blinding definitely was amazing after I wet the brush so T no shade I think the metallics definitely do need a little bit of moisture to really take it there but that was announced on social media so there's no games here now I have used five shades in the palette so far I am loving the formula of course I think all the masks are going to feel the same same with the shimmers or the metallics so I am going to quickly put on some black eyeliner in my waterline and some mascara and I'll be right back alright you guys I quickly put on some roller lash from benefit on the lashes and I'm loving it now normally I would use false lashes but I think it's summer let's just keep it a little more subtle and cute let's move on to lips but of course let me give you my full on first impressions thoughts I think that the matte shades in this palette were amazing they blended beautifully just like every other brand that I love and respect so shout out to Kylie I think the formula is great alright let's move on to the matte liquid lips and now here we have the send me more nudes collection so for $45 you get four shades and they look like this I love the camel nude gold packaging I think it is stunning now from left to right we have naked we have birthday suit and I let's just talk about the elephant in the room I also have a lipstick called birthday suit from my collection I know the internet was going crazy at the end of the day it's a shade name and we all make these things in advance so it's a coincidence anyway we have so we have naked we have birthday suit we have commando and we have their I am going to swatch one of them on my lips and put one of the glosses over it and then I'll swatch the other three on my hand just so you guys can see what they look like and I was going to take the first one called naked I haven't a fan of the matte formula same wand same type of like candy licorice scent let's see how it goes on all right you guys here is the shade naked swatched I think it is really gorgeous it is very consistent with the past formulas all her news are always bomb I do want to swatch them all in my hand for you guys so I will swatch this one one more time my hand is so glittery today so we have naked right there and here we have birthday suit which is a looks like it's a little darker nude than the one that I just swatch on my mouth oh yeah definitely can tell on the monitor it is a more caramel nude and now we have commando which is an even darker nude and now we have the shade bear oh girl I love that one I'm not to try that in a video later so here are all of the four matte liquid lips there's also one other liquid to matte lip kit in the vacation collection that this shade is called junebug now the internet was once again going crazy now normally in reviews you guys I never talk about myself or my own brand you know I'm not about that life but when the internet saw the shade it looks like this they were going crazy saying that it looked like my shade coming out called you better work so when you see them together you guys hers is definitely more neon and bright I did a swatch comparison on snapchat let me insert that right here and as you guys can see mine is a more deeper darker violet purple and hers is a more hot neon purple so there is definitely different no install anyone's ideas relax take a breather take a hit girl let's move on so there are two glosses with a different formula and the box looks like this these are the super glitter glosses there are two shades we have a glamour and we have glitz I definitely want to put one over this lip here and if you hold them up I mean you can see they're blinding in here they look very glittery on snapchat and online I was like oh my lord girl I'm just going to put it right on top of this now at first I thought I was going to hate the little brush you guys see it is very little right here it lets you get right on the edge and define it really quickly I'm like looking in the mirror like whoa so I think it's only fair that we do a little swatch of course this is glitz one more time on the hand as you can see it is a very very pigmented and glossy and then the next one we have is glamour which of course I said it was a more Goldy bronze color and let's just put that right next to that one oh yeah that one's really pretty Wow all right so there are both of the super glitter glasses alright and because my cheekbones are already glowing for the gauze I needed a chic model hi baby hi baby so today David is going to help me model a few other of the highlighters from the vacation collection so today babe we are going to try the ultra glow loose powder highlights these highlighters are supposed to be blinding I mean we're think about my cheek I mean it's pretty it's pretty blinding that's a wild on what do think about a lip kind of sit yeah it's pretty it's crazy it's got like a little of luminescence of pink it's pretty crazy cool so today we're going to try out two shades of the ultra glow powders today we have Santorini and we have Fiji all right so let's try Santorini first and you open them up and they look like this so I have this little brush here I'm just gonna lightly dip in there alright cool don't move oh holy we were head a little bit my blinding well okay let me let me get more this is blinding okay yes Santa ruder now let's try Fiji with a clean brush we'll use this little Anastasio on and less oh oh my god you can't hold on let me try let me turn you this way over there you go right there oh yeah baby right there I like it it's more like flush sheet because I just like it matches your skin tone more so it's definitely blending in yeah my hands kind of like I've definitely been getting some Sun lately so you know I like it it's cute I think the other one turned to me is almost a little bit more blinding but this one matches Nathan skin tone perfectly so Fiji is more like you bronzed the softer glow if you want to call it soft but um wow these are really pretty and there is a third one we are out of cheek bones today but we are what is called Tahiti oh that's me been there yes I have under my nose I mean it so let's do it give a little whirl right here here we'll do an extreme nose highlight it's definitely more subtle and I don't mind it I will just Dallas triple nose in it people can greet us later oh my god okay I mean that is blinding you guys look at his nose it looks a little looks wedge thanks babe yeah of course okay so also in this bundle you guys there are velvet liquid lips which are the formula that she created that are not kiss proof that dry down and they're actually the identical shades to the liquid to matte so I don't really think we need to swatch them you guys saw them earlier on my hand these two just don't dry down besides that there is something called a face duo I guess we should open that up before we before we leave everyone oh okay so it's a highlighter and ruther all right kela so blow up oh okay so glow up is like a blinding metallic no it's good and then of course Sunkist is a bronzer and it looks like that swatch brand mm-hmm cute so you guys that is the entire vacation collection from Kylie cosmetics I think I'm just gonna do a quick little recap to my favorite items to the entire collection are the

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel hi good morning how are you alright you guys I am really really excited for today's first impression slash review because today we are going to be testing out the brand new Fenty Beauty galaxy collection just look at the packaging for a second we just drink it in first of all Rihanna just came hard she dropped her brand-new makeup line in September like good morning you bitches better wake the fuck up and here we are already a month and a half later and she has the Holiday Collection out I'm like RiRi you better slow it down baby girl so today you guys we are going to dive into everything we got the lip glitter glosses we got the hyper glitz lipsticks we have liners and of course we have the coveted galaxy eyeshadow palette so we're going to play it with all of this yumminess today I do want to quickly read myself to filth because my fenty video which I gotta say thank you to everyone out there watches my channel and appreciates my makeup reviews because you guys have made my Fenty Beauty review the number one most watched FNT video on the internet and I'm like girl y'all are fuckin crazy so in that video I had filmed it in my hotel room the day after the Rihanna event right the big launch party a shade matched myself with really dark lighting and in the video a lot of you were like oh my god the foundation turned really orange on you it oxidized it got weird what happened and I kind of never really got to say my side of the story I definitely shade match for myself wrong and also I think a lot of people forgot that I was filming with natural daylight in a bed so my beauty lights and everything that we're at home we're definitely not there in New York so I think it even looked crazier I apologize now I am wearing my correct foundation shade I'm sure you guys can tell now so I actually like to mix because that's just what I like to do I like to be slightly a little more tanks I am so pale so this is shade 140 and 170 I do a big like three pumps of 140 and then I do one pump of 170 and I mix it around with the brush and then and also because I know everyone's gonna be asking I am also wearing the which shade is this this is the kilowatt freestyle highlighter duo and I am wearing the shade on the right which is fire crystal it is so pretty look at that mmm and of course a lot of you are gonna be asking me wow this is the gloss balm universal lip Luminizer of course from venti as well it's a Fendi video girl okay you guys I think as I'm the dive into this damn review let's see if this eyeshadow palette works we're gonna do some swatches of the lips and I can't wait to get galactic so of course first product that I have been dying to try is the Fendi Beauty galaxy eyeshadow palette here is the unit carton it has this gorgeous I call it an oil slick metallic feel to it all the packaging has the same of course feel once you open it up first of all on the back it does have all the shades which is cool this says that it is hyper reflective phenomenal 3d flex with infinite new dimensions so this whole entire theme of the holiday collection is of course called galaxy it's very space in alien-themed which I've been calling myself an alien since eighth grade so I appreciate this and I was really excited to see that everything was sparkly and had that really cool alien oil vibe is what I'm gonna call it the oil slick so when you open up the unit cart in this beautiful jeweled like compact M comes out now I love it it's very slim so you can travel with it it's not too much on the back it has all the shade names of course they are all very Spacey we got Jupiter sand Milky Way Lightyear Extra Terrestrial cosmic ocean so they're all very like space themed which I live for so let's open her up this feels expensive you guys know I do not like cheap packaging and I'm always telling you about it once you open it up of course it has a beautiful nice gigantic mirror which I always appreciate let's just do a little overview of these shades now this palette is a limited edition it is a glitter eyeshadow palette of 14 star dusted shades designed to accessorize any eye look so I think that that's very important to know is because a lot of you may think this is just like a normal palette that you just take a brush and you dig into and it's gonna have like this crazy look so these eyeshadows are going to have a of different formulas it says here that some are shear some are glittering topcoats to smoky shimmer drenched hues like jewelry for your eyes hmm you can use these with a brush and it actually comes with a brush you guys so let's talk about the brush real quick here is the box of course the same type of feel in the packaging now this brush retails for $24 of course the eyeshadow palette retailed for $59 now this once you open it up this is called the galaxy 2 way I shadow brush once you open it up here is what it looks like now this brush you guys that says is petite and smudges plush and blends custom cut for the ultimate glitter effect one side is going to smudge obviously I'm gonna assume is just a little one and then the other side is going to blend out or it almost feels like a packer brush so do i prime my eyes with this what am I supposed to do let's read the website now it says from smokey iridescent violet to gold glitter on mint galaxy is studded with unique colors and glitter combos that deliver a phenomenal 3d effect real quickly you guys this says wear eyeshadow solo for a sheer - smokey effect so that I think is very important to know so this is not gonna give you some crazy light it's not gonna look like you took loose glitter and it has that type of moment it's gonna give more of a like a really cool shift or it says layer top coats over any eyeshadow for a brilliant out-of-this-world boost and of course it says for intense intensity wet your brush which we all know you can do that with anything whether it's highlighting or eyeshadow if you want the brush girl on a metallic you know it's gonna pop well let's get ready to do this look I'm going to dip into the Mac painterly paint-pot and prime these eyes and I like to use a little synthetic brush now I do want to put down a little bit of regular eyeshadow so we can try topping them are you a top or are you a bottom you think we should use brushes we should use our finger and we should just play around and have some fun so I'm going to take a V androgyny eyeshadow palette and I am just going to take a little what is this the Bobbi Brown eye blender and I'm just going to dip into shade charm really quickly and we are going to lay down a transition shade and maybe put a little bit of the green and blue in there just so we can see if these works so I'm just going to take this and put this right into the crease alright we have the transition shade down curve we are blended all right so let's put in a few more colors and get this show on the road so I am going to dip into shade poison right now I'm just going to take this and put this right in my deep set eyes and my crease and hi it's fall people dark green eye shadow is like I just smoked out my eyes a little bit with of course the shade of poison and charm that's all I used so now we are ready to move on to the galaxy palette I am going to start off God they're all so pretty I really want to try this one right here called cosmic ocean it looks stunning now where is that brush so I'm gonna try to use this I heard you know when people do those little Instagram tutorials I saw people digging in and just kind of going in only problem I have this long nail that is in the way but I'm still going to touch it ok it feels nice the textures not too gritty so it's more like a smoother texture and I'm just gonna take this and put it in the inner corner or try to because I have these long ass fucking nails I'm just gonna kind of put it right there on the lid let's see how it looks on the brush ok I think it likes it like a little more flaky with the brush without wetting it I always wet my brush but I know a lot of people are like well try both on camera so we don't wet the brush we know what it looks like and I'm like girl so I wet the brush if you take this like this you're gonna get some pigment and this is easy this is of course this is the smudger side so I'm just gonna take this and oh yeah it's actually depositing it totally fine okay girl but if you do want to wet it which we're about to try you definitely can now this is of course a glitter type formula so I'm just going to take a clean brush and just sweep away the fallout or you can just rub it into your skin because it's glitter and why not all right so let's wet the brush and let's see what happens I'm going to take a little morphe setting spray we got her wetted down and now let's dip into cosmic ocean now let's just put that right in here oh okay definitely intensify that hot damn baby all right now we're gonna dip into shade midnight bolt which is this one right below that one now you guys this is really pretty my eyes look like I was like baby blue glass on it and the glitter though I'm getting excited alright so let's just take our finger real quickly right here and oh that is a really cool shade I'm gonna apply that kind of in the middle on top of what we already did and just press down and oh wow this is a look it's a look so then we're gonna leave a little bit of that shade of poison right here and I'm just gonna blend it together so it looks nice alright I threw one some max smolder liner in my waterline now these shades girl they got pigment now we're gonna go into the shade god extraterrestrial so pretty and so is sublime so extraterrestrial is right here this looks so pretty looks like a Japanese beetle like the shell of it so I'm just gonna take a little bit of that now that one looks like it has like one of the formulas that has glitter and pigment and not just like a top coat so I'm gonna take this a little bit right here and let's just press it under my eye and let's see what happens and love the shimmer and it's just an easy way to smoke it out all right now let's take this shade sublime right here it's like an ether oh it almost looks silver then you move it and then it's a green ish like it's cool here I'll show you with my finger a little bit see there you go mmm-hmmm and the pan it almost reads a little silver so I am going to take this brush and I'm gonna just dip it in and we're gonna go right in here and I'm actually going to wet the brush a little bit because Mama wants high intensity alright then we're just going to take the shadow and place it right there huh Wow there's a gold like kind of like flakes in there glitter and bam whoa that shade laid down really nicely now I did want to try out the like kind of shader blending site on this so I was gonna dip into what are we gonna dip into cloth there's so many shades I want to try it we're gonna definitely have to use this in another look so I'm just gonna take this shade what is this one Jupiter sand this one right here look at how weird that looks it's such a cool unique shade so I'm gonna dip in oh it's like a brown to have a base okay so I'm just gonna pop this a little bit right in here I know I'm like maybe going overkill with the shadows but I just wanted to try it out okay the good match is too closely to what I already have in there but oh okay I see some shimmer in there I do already know how I feel about this palette I'm sure you can gauge how pretty this I look is so we will talk about it of course in the outro but let's get to swatching the eyeliners all right the next product we are going to be talking about is the eclipse two and one glitter a release eye liner now I have two shades here today we have never turned and we have alien bay so here's what the component looks like you get a wand I'm going to assume wallah there she is whoa it almost looks like black black but up close you can see that it has like some glitter reflex in there this retails for $20 and I have two shades right here they are both really dark like the bases and I'm not sure what they do so let's find out this is a limited edition liquid eyeliner with a transforming metallic to glitter formula that lets you choose your own finish oh wow okay a low-key metallic or high-impact Sparkle this delivers both worlds in one of its revolutionary blend of intense pigment and pearl essence that dries to a sleek metallic finish rub it when it's dry to reveal a surprising glitter effect this liner puts the power to go from data play literally at your fingertips so we are going to take shade yes blue ones pretty cool okay alien Bay I know my shadows are really crazy right now but we are just going to put this right across and let's see what happens on my lid alright you guys let's just put a little bit of this down oh wow no I didn't do any lashes yet you guys see I have mascara on because I wanted to test out the liner alright so I think what we do is I'm going to just do a little dramatic wing here and let's see if there's glitter on all right there is a little wing aligner so let's let this dry and let's try to rub her out alright you guys it is now dry so alien bay is on this side and I put Knepp turnt on this side it says to rub it with your fingers I think well it says rub when dry so what does rub means I kind of use a clean brush can I use a finger scared so I guess we'll just try both maybe alright so I'm gonna take my pinky and let's zoom in right here and let's see oh my god I got glitter all over me alright let's see what happens I mean definitely blue glitter came through that is a trip like my fingers clean

your a distant glitter drenched in a mirror-like shine for a mega dose of multi-dimensional shimmer in one swipe unlike other glitter lip glosses this is designed to be unbelievably smooth and creamy for out-of-this-world shine plus phenomenal comfort I love that all right well let's see if it's really real let's try spacesuit that is this guy right here oh my god it's like creme brulee vanilla like I'm fucking hungry I have the munchies okay so the dough foot looks like this it is large and flat and let's just go directly on the mouth hmm whoa so there's the difference of no lipgloss with the product only down here and girl that is really shiny and I okay now we're going to just touch our lips together doesn't stick doesn't feel weird it doesn't look gummy at all like look at the glitter and the pearls in here like I'm living for this formula okay so I loved how the doe foot was long so it really got my entire lip I didn't even have to dunk twice this is literally one dunk in and it covered like my whole mouth so that is pretty impressive and smell so pretty this is a good formula right you guys I think we've tested out everything here I do want to quickly swatch a few of these just because they look so pretty oh my god and imagine this over like a lipstick so sorry I know my head has a bunch of glitter on it but we will just test right here oh my God look at that dirt dirt okay and then I have to swatch this one because it looks so damn pretty in the bottle first of all that last one was cold plutonic a relationship and then this other one is called gal on the moon I thought it looks so stunning in the bottle so I know my hands are not the best but look at that pigment like oh wow those are stunning alright you guys so I think we have tried out enough I think I know my final thoughts so let's get into it alright you guys so the Fenty beauty collection the galaxy collection first of all let's go through everything alright so I just kind of want to put it out there that this was a really fun video to do I loved all the glitters I loved all the formulas and reona you made makeup fun again for me thank you for that today all right so let's move on to the products the galaxy eyeshadow palette I think was really pretty and definitely a unique idea I mean you really don't see full glitter shimmer eyeshadow palettes on the market you usually see always a mix obviously it's mattes and metallics and shimmers and everyone's always all over the place so to have an entire palette dedicated to a glitter definitely a unique idea I loved it the formulas were great of course it's glitter you're gonna have a little bit of fall out it's not gonna blend like a normal shadow and I love how clear they were on the site and on the packaging of exactly how they were going to perform so the palette a plus love it let's move on to the liners now I'm not always a liner type of person but this formula was great it was a very opaque as you see the glitter activated immediately when I touched it and I loved it it was definitely something new on the market it reminded me of the where is it the glitter flip lipstick when I went on the review a month ago we all know what this is by now it reminded me of that in a I form these ones are really cool they were different and a unique makeup product on the market which is kind of hard to do nowadays so I liked that now let's move on alright let's go to the lipsticks these were fun these aren't really up my alley I don't normally like slim line lipsticks I love a normal like big stick but these ones were really cute I liked the formula they were not gritty at all they had a really nice coverage they were metallic and they did exactly what um you know they said so these are definitely cute and the pink ones are gonna be going in my purse alright and quickly before we move on to the last thing this eyeshadow brush even though I am always shading brands they put the cheapest brushes with their eyeshadow palettes distant perform it did work it didn't feel too rough you know sometimes you get a brush with the palette and you're like my eyes bleeding this one did not do that at all and it actually did what it said which I appreciate last but not least of course the lip glitter glosses now obviously I'm wearing it I've been wearing it and went downstairs and I drank a root beer float and put on this way and the gloss is still really pretty I love it the formula is beautiful so I was shocked I had no idea what to expect I've been hearing things throughout the makeup community about what everything is and I had no idea really what to expect but I'm like okay there's a lot of products here I'm definitely gonna not like at least one of them I'm wrong Rihanna you did that baby so the Fenty Beauty galaxy collection and I can't believe I'm saying this but the entire collection is jeffree star approved BAM bitch it was beautiful I can't wait to take this to Finland I am leaving literally you guys tomorrow I will be in Finland for a week we're doing a big makeup convention so if you are from Europe or Finland I will leave it linked down below and if the rest of you are like girl we don't live there we don't care then keep on watching or don't keep on watching because the video is about the end all right you guys this collection was really awesome Rihanna killed it I cannot wait to see what else they come out with thank you for watching mwah I'll see you on the next one 
What's up everybody welcome back to my channel alright today We're gonna dive into some glitter some liquid lips And I guess they're gonna be combined and some crazy magical shit is supposed to go down now I have been in Michigan for a few days so girl. She's back, and I'm ready to roll today we're going to dive into something that I've seen all over the internet, and it is the Ciaté London glitter flip liquid lipsticks now I had to try this for myself because they kind of went viral and Instagram everyone was talking about it And I like Jeffree try it out. Let's see if they're Jeffree Star Approved so when I got these in the mail I was like okay. I'm gonna save them. I'm gonna try them a lot of the times. I get so giddy and excited I will try things before filming with them, and then I'll be like okay I already tried it not filming it so these I was like okay We're gonna put them aside and here we are so today. We are going to dive into them I actually have all the colors here, but I feel like if most of them work Do we need to try all the damn shades I know at home you guys are like my mouth is saying no So we will do 5 out of these 7, but I do have them all here And I guess basically if you want to see me try these out - keep on watching alright So they all of course come in these unit cartons, and there is of course I just said it's seven shades, and they all retail for and nineteen dollars a piece I think that's pretty fair for this type of brand now on this side of the box. It says that this is a Transforming glitter liquid lipstick now. I don't really think this has ever been done before as far as this type of formula So you know I love when a brand makes something that is not out yet So this says glitter lips made easy with cia's a glitter flip simply press lips together and watches metallic matte liquid lipstick magically transforms into a dazzling multi dimension glitter lip with none of the mess and a fraction of the time of a traditional glitter lip look now of course We all know When you want to do a glitter lipstick you put down a normal base you take glitter in a pot you take it and you Press it on your mouth now over time does that look good. No because after 10 minutes. It's all over your face It's just a mess and it doesn't really last throughout the day if you go to eat with that Goodbye, this extra sounds are pretty cool Literally apply dry press and pop so it sounds pretty easy to do this product says that it has zero point one zero one fluid ounces, okay, and Let's open it up and see what's inside all right? Okay, so the top of it is glitter and this reminds me of the Mack mariah carey collection anyone else got that last year Very similar, but the packaging is cute. We got the stars on there We have the logo of course and this shade is called candy. Okay, so I think um Do I want to try the pink first I kind of want to try this crazy purple this because I have purple eyeshadow on today, so I'm just gonna unbox them all and Let's see if they work, so I was just reading on the website And I just want to let everyone know that this product is vegan. It's cruelty free It's formulated without gluten and this is supposed to be a stay put formula with Non-drying and toward a little comfortable wear will last all night with no need for retouching well if you're me you're gonna need some retouching cuz bitch bra was on her knees so this color is called fortune and Let's see if they smell like anything crazy. Here is what the applicator looks like it is Kind of flat has a little bit of an arch right there and then Let's see what they smell like hmm Not really anything which is shocking cuz usually when there's glitter in something. It kind of smells a little weird or a little intense, but Hmm nothing all right, so let's go in and see what this is all about oh Okay coverage All right, so I dipped in once and I got my entire bottom lip so let's finish her off All right here is the lipstick fully swatched, I must say I'm a little surprised at how pigmented and full coverage that went on like this looks so pretty by itself of course I have not pressed my lips together whatsoever yet, and you do see that There is already shimmer and a little bit of the metallic hue over the lip obviously it's a very prominent right there And I really like this color already now of course the moment We've all been waiting for it let's zoom in and press our lips together and see what the fuck is about to happen So here we go one two Whoa Okay that definitely activated a lot of glitter. Let's do it a few more times oh It's almost like a disco ball kind of like that like blown on my mouth wow, I'm like hmm any of my teeth No, okay, you guys so this definitely worked no ifs ands or buts about it I love this color here, so I'm like okay. If you take your finger. What happens if you rub it. I'm just curious Well nothing really comes off a little bit obviously it maybe not be fully fully dry yet, but wow this is really pretty I'm like ooh. I think that these are really light which is nice I was afraid that there would be like too thick but the lips don't feel like if they're Crunchy or that there's anything really on them again when you close your eyes, and you're like It doesn't really feel like there's that much in there, which is nice. The glitter doesn't feel chunky. It's definitely sparkling I'm gonna take my flash on my iPhone real quickly here, and let's put it on my mouth and see Hmm. Oh look at Whoa okay I might be obsessed with these let's try another one the next shade is called candy And it is this soft rosy pink I thought let's try a lighter shade and see if the glitter still activates as strongly And then we'll move on so let's give this color a whirl All right, let's see if candy has the same metallic glitter moment it looks very very match And there's not really that much of a metallic sheen compared to the first one. We just did well. Let's see right now Whoa That is really pretty I'm like oh, okay I've never really seen a formula like this, so I am definitely impressed and that looks really really pretty Whoa okay this one is really cool because it's the color subtle what the glitter is Stunning now. I've been dying to try this crazy mermaid teal color. It is called siren and Close-up it has like teal glitter on top of the teal so I think this is gonna look pretty cute Let's see if the teal one works Woah holy shit, huh All right, let's see if siren has the same glitter effect, which I think by now We know because look how beautiful and metallic that looks without pressing together already. I'm like who lowered alright here. We go, ooh This one packs a punch and it definitely has a lot of glitter in it which I love mm-hmm Okay, this color is a really cool. I know it's a little edgy. It's a little out there So if you're someone that is a little afraid of crazy colors I think of course that last one candy would definitely be good for you, but this one Lord Jesus I love it alright the green stain my mouth a little bit It looks like I've been sucking off a dragon on Game of Thrones But back to the pieces of watching this one. It looks to be like a crazy red with like pink glitter. It's called Hollywood and Let's see what she looks like All right now this color by itself before we even in glitter Philippa tis so pretty I love the undertone and that pink like metallic who you already see the glitter wants to come forward right in the fry It's like let me out, so let's let this dry for a second and give her a spin all right now Let's give Hollywood a flip and see how pretty it looks oh That's silver that just came out with the pink is Spectacular this might be my favorite, maybe it's cuz my makeup I'm not sure, but I'm looking in the monitor, and I'm like what the hell this one is Obviously by now I think we know the formula works the glitter looks so pretty they all have of course different hues of glitter different Tones, I'm definitely really loving this formula, so we could stop here But then I saw this one called iconic And it is a more almost like a black version of this purple one that we first swatch and it has crazy Amount of glitter in it so I do want to keep this on, but I will swatch this one as well But don't do this one's hot it last but not least we are going to try Iconic my mouth is getting a little raw all the glitter and the formula it does last Sonam We're moving it in between takes you guys It's a mess, but we got one more to go, so let's see how does Kylie rocks? Holy shit All right, let's give this one a flip and here we go Whoa I'm like are we serving some mermaid realness, or what the blue green and pink glitter Undertones, I'm like holy shit hmm. I don't know which one's my favorite I'm sitting here looking at the all the colors, and I'm like oh my god like look at the way this glue door moves I'm like It's so satisfiying damn it all right you guys I think this is maybe my second runner-up, but I think the red is stole the show for me I thought the purple was like fucking Bomb as well and the teal of course, but this red one was my favorite I think the glitter just looked spectacular, and I can't wait to wear again now this finale though. I'm like Looks like a fireworks on my mouth, and I'm loving every second of it. All right you guys I think it is time to give my final thoughts now. I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into when I First saw these, but I'm pleasantly surprised that ciate London Slade killed deceased murdered this formula I really loved it, and if you guys have a chance to pick up a few colors I highly recommend the red and pink But if you're a little more on the daring side wear this wear to a wedding wear it to a funeral and where to target But I'm alright you guys. I think it's no shocker here that the CIA London glitter flip a liquid lipstick is Geoffrey star approved, I am really really happy that this brand is stepping it up and they're trying new things And I can't wait to see what they come out what's next all right you guys.

trays in our mouths and the graphics bugs the rest of history exactly are you guys so if you want to see us get ready and spill the damn key and keep on watching okay so proprietor where Manny's never tried this before I've been using it for a while as you can see this is from the brand touch and soul then the name makes me want to read it as a creative but it's called no pores Loman like no problem before yeah Donna convergence really a you know portal um I make you just violate it I don't like it at a smooth and poor covering primer it's amazing and it probably has more silicone on my face shuffle what if you saw guys please though it made me fucking ton oh that too much nothing it's fine got a big fuckin face and then is it smell really like it was really good come on I'm not fucking playing you have a favorite baby people with me watching your favorite video is actually in my July favorites I'm hooked crazy there's so many primers like coming out lately it's like every brand is like coming out it's just my breath smell it too many things in general they are it's a lot as overwhelming you can throw that whatever like brands are coming out with so much stuff it's just way too overwhelming I hate it and on a feed us I think to like I don't be shady or anything but I think also like a lot of people are coming out different brands like so much and I out and I also feel like the people how much ok randoms I know I want to take the new milk foundation ok so try out yes but I feel like people are pointing to like you look I would make a brand but they're not passionate on me good let me tell ya like I feel like it's not I wanted a talk with money yeah the quick bar and that's getting me noise it's like what about all of us who actually care about me doesn't actually care about like the well-being of consumers right now it's I'm going I don't break my own break make a brand and it's like I'm working so hard and doing everything I can to make it perfect yes but like and as well so there's different like ways to create a brand there's someone like me or you or honest ostia or other in like people that started from the ground up or up to that create yes of course i'm laura that create from the ground up and it's not just like what people call like a private label where you just go into a lab and they already have everything done and you just like oh yeah I want this mess and this and like 20 brands all have the same thing this is like actual we're really working with the lab we're creating real colors custom everything I think that's the big difference oh come on no yeah how's it again come on okay wait real quick I'm going to go in with the brand-new YSL beauty all ours foundation I use it only once so far and I'm a fan okay I'm gonna put this damn foundation on my foundation I normally go in with over that over this my fucking wiping it off long time to wipe off well this was supposed to be a really full coverage oh I know you're going for tribal one other thing I wanted to say randomly I've seen she's like a random thing I was noticing like so people coming out brands right like they're following their dreams yeah Kevin England being like something like people coming out to that and I know for a fact are not like really having leverage and they don't wanna go client that's annoying to me but I also think it's really frustrating when I see people like hating on them for coming out with their own brand because they acid and they they still are following their dreams yeah becoming older or like they're doing their own thing and it's like why do people have to hate on someone falling with wires internet so a damn ugly y'all that's what I want to know Chloe I just don't get it and I know I think I joined you too but it's such a crazy time agree mmm oh my god I'm a year and a half in and I'm like my head spinning like thank you alright so what the graphics from my kitchen and we haven't tried these yet these are the colour-pop no filter concealer mm-hmm the nudies literally just launched they should also with like they came out with like highlighting palette not like a lot of standards like how the tons everything i mean i love color cloth but they put out so many DM skews i know that it's so affordable so they kind of get away with it definitely but it's again let me enjoy the the eyeshadow pot my highlighter palette i one thing i think is like my annoyance about that matrix too often it loses its charm it does it's a lot alright so i'm going to go in with show you spare five it is like the lightest shade I think I'm going with light neutral which is 15 okay let's a bit of world on foreigners receiving face board if it dries too quickly and only ones I rude wait I said blend oh look look at that coverage like over your tattoos oh okay alright now let's set this damn concealer actually really liked it I did show but I noticed that like it is falling it's my fine line the wrinkle so you'd have to set it pretty quick I'm assuming it is for to not be able to fall in because why do you like it I set the concealer so Manny told me to pick this up out of my drawer I haven't use this yet like I just like I've been getting so much product lately I'm like overwhelmed I love it I really hope you looking feminine and mine brand-new and I use the site this VT as well okay so there's a cream contour side mm-hmm okay and I like a really bright highlight it was dark it works on me félicité even works on me okay a little dark for you but what if it was not nice okay the thing okay let me our each let me just try this before I do the whole face am really sheers out with a Beauty Blender I mean I was probably absorbing a little bit of product and I would do powder over anyway obviously to set it Oh same look I'm not mad at this my cheekbones a car there Q there's one side it lower the norm honesty looks really good on your I can see it like it looks nice okay cool it's soft I love that that's so pigmented has become such a thing oh my god okay you guys you look so crazy is I like when you're with your best friends you all talk alike you all get the same funny things wrong we all do that and Manny like that's just his thing I just do more than others he doesn't he does it with everyone and I never noticed filming so when I mean we have so many videos together more than four you really took their time I know like I've never liked and I remember it's kind of cool to look at your book you get to like see all the videos we film yeah oh definitely sounds a lot yeah it's turning to this crazy viral thing it's a circus guys it's so funny to go on peoples channels and see like summer in the comments section of they're not even baby like I don't at all and it's literally just it's like they're talking to me because Manny repeating the same thing and I'm like huh where did this come right now it's already funny I love it it's cool I did too I think it's so fun to like guys it's so fun to make fun of yourself with why take life so seriously you guys that it is so what nice to make fun yourself why take life so serious [Laughter] the concealer has like fine line that's what I was saying about mine look at that look at my fuckin eyes I don't look they look like that no but when it blended out and the one I said it and kind of not living no offense like what who fucking cares I'm offending anyone it's just I'm like oh yeah my under eye wrinkles are gnarly right now they look I don't I'm not look and so or might even like my smiling wrinkles like they're usually not too tight either all right well many is a little bronze I'm about to bronze up a tiny bit mate has emerge ages wonders July I live for this I'm so bummed that was a limited edition and I don't even people get this again no idea they look at that maybe but you know it's really you know it's really fucked up I may have bought in like two months before Colleen judaics ago yeah you're going that rent okay so open out money if I like something I'm like I'm scared no I know I would love this I love at this bronzer color alright so we're going to dip into this I've never tried this before I have powder so so pigmented okay it was really powdery to not powdery something be tried but definitely contouring Oh like subculture it kind of crazed how the witch hunt has gotten so severe for a brand new bat though like I think it's so stupid that people have gone to this level yeah now I get everyone out there wants to know is a palate good or not obviously a lot of us had proven that there was a lot of problems with it it was inconsistent who knows that the lab had issues obviously there was the issue every single youtuber is going ham about all of them well most their forefront beauty brand that's what it is like they're at one of the frontrunners when it comes to anything beauty like their there's no denying it they're one of the biggest on social media yes they are and they had a fuckin and they had a fuck to polish it make it happen not everyone is gonna have the best launches ever but I think when they've had such a good track record I think it was shocking to people about like a modern renaissance was so successful here's the follow up which I looked back at them once a year yes later someone and I think a lot of people were just kind of like really really shocked people cats like seeing like all the modern responses super powdery to I said yeah it is powdery I said I'm I review it it's super powdery but it blends when I know so I don't know what happened at the end of the day obviously we stick by our reviews but I love the brand there's one palette that we didn't love this I mean okay all of a sudden they're cancelled like that's a problem with the internet and people are just so aggressive it'll ready to jump on like a bandwagon yeah that's the problem we hate them oh my girl you're gonna be wearing a new shit when it drops next month come on half the people that he does don't even know why they hate us they just find because everyone else does sad it's so fuckin different although Ruthie that's just some real shit like a big okay it's funny cuz I always feel like this like whenever people would meet me in person like even if I could hater maybe in person I'm sure they were actually enjoy like the experience it wouldn't it be like I'm really nice and like all these things and people would want to make it seem like I'm gonna be uh huh do it I'm gonna be like a complete ass I'm like oh I know I get that you and my grommets just I'm just I'm just one little person on this earth tryna live and it's just I think there's one day here's one little person just one little little horrible but yeah the internet has just been so brutal lately you guys since I've entered the YouTube realm I've never read or seen or been abused by so much hate and in my comments and people in general and I get that that's what comes with success because everyone out there watching has shown us so much love and it's just something he's going to do with ya okay we're going to quickly do blush before we run our mouths and we're going to go in with the new Saharan blush volume 2 from Julia's please M hmm I've never used this yet I worked it beautiful I ordered it myself looks really really pretty I know this color hello kids look at that look see have a look on the face so I held a deep yesterday and we all talked about how being on solution we have been like biggest blessings of our lives and how we're so lucky to be in the place that we are by it it's crazy because we struggle so much more now against so much more anxiety we have so much more things to worry about then that we had like no money no hood sex no nothing and that's some real shit that maybe a lot of people don't take it wrong when he does that you guys I think a lot of people think that money equals I mean real happiness it doesn't at all no

house I've gotten to help my cousins who are struggling in college by them you know car then it's like it's just so fulfilling to be able to help the ones you love and donate to charity yes I mean Manning is donating to charity a lot and definitely you know trying to show that that's okay to promote as well as yeah people love to talk about drama all the time but you know if I donate or do anything and promote it no one wants to talk about it yeah it's not hot gossip it's not hot news it's what you'd be like person that's not interesting and it's not fun what he's actually he's actually nice like people just focus on so much negativity a lot I guess online and I hate saying that on my channel cuz most people out there obviously watching us enjoy us love what we're doing and they support us but there's a lot of people that don't and as if this brand and life and career grows it's hard to kind of stay sane sometimes oh my god and no one talks about this you guys so many people want to put up a front and they're all fraud you like oh my god I'm so happy all the fucking time it's like no how you're not though like on the realest level like no I don't know anyone says like

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I am really excited because I am doing a first impression slash swatch review on the brand new Dior Rouge liquid lipsticks oh my god now if you've been following my channel for a while you know that the Dior air flash is literally one of my favorite foundations ever I think I literally mentioned it in the video before this in my July favorites I was like when I discovered this like 5 years ago I don't know what happened with my life changed that's what happened I don't even know why I'm mentioning that I just thought you guys should know that you're fucking sick but sometimes brands have misses sometimes they have his and you know me we're going to keep it really gangster today as usual and see if this product is Geoffrey start or proof or not I am very critical when it comes to liquid lips I have to literally tried drugstore all the way to the most expensive liquid lip on the planet on this channel and you never know what you're going to get sometimes the luxury brands come at you and you want to scream and cry but I am excited to give you guys the first sneak peek of this product now I did reach out to the or on sa girl do you mind if I swatch of those on my channel and give them a whirl and they were like some brands I'm going to keep it real with you guys as always some brands have told me no I'm sorry I'm like ok cool well when it comes out I'm going to buy it and review it anyway you can't stop me but I have had brands tell me if you are iffy about the product or you don't like it can you just not talk about it and I'm like no that's not how I work so I really appreciate your sending me this collection of liquid lips I am really excited to talk about them and swatch them that I have been saving this for a few days I haven't even swatch them on my hands or tried anything yet so I'm sitting you're like ok let's dive into it so if you want to see me swatch the nudie or liquid lipsticks thank you for watching so they come in a gorgeous blue unit car in a very classic Dior we all have seen this before on my channel now of course the shade labels are on top now there is three formulas there is a rock matte which is I guess fully matte long-lasting then there is an electric metal formula and then there is a pop satin which i think is more like a satin type lipstick of course we are going to log in and see exactly what it's supposed to happen here so the packaging looks like this and this component is really classic it looks very classy to your course with a little imprint you can see the color through the window which I love so all of them have that I'm going to test out a few of the formulas today I'm really excited for the metals because oh my god girl we're simply no logical because this is a hologram it's almost like a lip topper you can wear it by itself or you can put it over other lipsticks to give it like a feel so this one I am really excited about on the website eat say is that this one is a multi-dimensional cyber silver that can be worn alone or used as a topcoat and I'm like oh girl I'm excited for this one I know a lot of brands really don't do black lipstick or kind of crazy colors but not new a girl we have a matte black lipstick which a lot of brands do not make this color or it's kind of hard to perfect it a lot of the time in blacks or greys or really chalky and weird so we don't test this formula out today baby alright so I think I'm just going to dive into the matte colors now here's the T on this one I'm going to read you what this formula is supposed to do now there is 29 colors you know my mouth cannot take 29 mm well that's in a whole nother video but 29 lip swatches is insane so I'm going to do about 10 for you today and test out the different formula that we're going to see what the hell is going on so the formula is supposed to be a very lightweight formula so it's kind of supposed to be kind of like a lipstick that you really don't feel now it is it says laced with featherweight pigments that produce intense vibrant color that lasts up to 12 hours oh my god well that is a long time so of course this is a long-lasting formula so this is yours first a liquid lipstick that they've ever produced and now there's a lot of shades here so it says all the way from creamy beige to classic Dior red and it also is a full-throttle black in three distinct textures which of course I already said so I mean let's stop running my mouth and let's get to swatching alright so the classic and $9.99 Dior Rouge is a classic red it is a very on the orange based side and I'm like you know what let's just go for the brightest color first I'm going to see what the hell happened besides that you guys I did want to mention a few things about this product it has 0.20 fluid ounces which is six ml for everyone out there that likes the computer so this is a Chanel lip gloss this has 0.19 so it actually has a little bit more so this is a good amount of product now of course the price point is $35 for all of them individually which that's a Dewar price point that is not bad but if it doesn't work one I'll see now it does have kind of a curved dough foot if you can zoom in right there and it looks like it should be easy to apply on the mouth with that slant so oh okay usually with like bright red or any oranges I like to use a liner or I have to be very careful but for some reason that's glided on super easy I'm a little shocked let's finish them out this color though I'm like girl I love a red so it has been about two minutes I wanted to see if it was going to completely dry down or what kind of effect we're going to give first impressions though I really love the doe foot I know a lot of you are like girl it's just a flat wand I want to show you something that it actually has a little divot inside I'm gonna try to zoom in as much as I can and try to help the students against the backdrop you see that divot that goes in there it holds product way more than I think a normal dope foot and it released gave a precise application obviously I didn't use a lip liner I just went in and it was easy to just kind of paint on which is nice because a lot of times some wands I got to use a lip liner and give extra work and it's annoying now let's feel it okay now there is a tiny bit of transfer so I know you should probably wait a little bit longer for a full dry down so we will do that with another color but doesn't feel sticky I know it did say the source is so lightweight it does thank God let's watch the next color I get asked a lot in between takes how do I remove the makeup I honestly just take a makeup wipe and I take my nail you guys and I go like this really sharp just go around and I wipe it all off and then if my mouth is ever feeling raw or ab dry skin I go in with a lip scrub most y'all know I make a lip scrub but this one is in flavor orange soda girl mmm you just put a little on an exfoliate your mouth all right let's get just watching let's just go in for the kill and do the matte black color because that's really what I've been dying to try this is literally probably darker than my soul oh my god my teeth look so white I give this lipstick okay so black lipsticks are hard to make and I got to give it up for because this is full coverage oh those are really good too and I just love it all right anyone else ready for Halloween all right now next up I actually want to try the hologram lipstick this is one of the metallics it is supposed to be multi-dimensional and of course it can be used as a top coat I definitely want to try that so I'm going to take the wall and it looks something like this this color is literally just called hologram and it looks really sparkly and cute in the bottle I'm also going to take a lip brush because I don't want this to get black transfer on it and I'm just going to take a bunch out BAM let's see how it looks on top of the black all right here is a hologram I'm only gonna do the bottom lip as you can see the contrast it looks really pretty it's very like intergalactic it almost looks like brush metal on my mouth now I do want to swatch it really quickly just on my hand so you guys can see what it would look like on normal skin and not black lipstick of course so I'm just going to do a little whoo okay I love it I think this alone would be really cute as a lot of reflective properties and there is a glitter in there so can't wait to use this in the future the next shader I'm going to swatch it's called a vibrant metal it looks so pretty in here look at that reflection but how's it going to look on my mouth Oh oh my god oh come on Pigman all right here is this shade is so watched I'm like oh my god it's just so pretty I love a good metallic liquid lip and I'm just going to let this dry for a second I want to see if it feels khaki or any different than the other ones but so far it feels really lightweight especially it's like a metallic sometimes I can feel a little gritty or weird but this one is drying nicely and I love how we're selective it is if you're someone that wants a little more of a subtle look you may not want the metals but this is sickening all right now this shade is called crush it is a matte and it looks like a Barbie pink so of course I gravitated towards it and we're going to give her a whirl [Music] okay this color makes me feel happy it is really pretty it is that classic like Barbie pink and I'm living for I'm like okay videos then I'm going to go now okay let's do a nude you guys this one is called chic it is the one of the matte formulas and it looks really pretty in here but how it's going to look on my whore mouth so this color is such an everyday easy nude to wear if you do not like crazy dark colors or brights definitely get to the nude family this one is stunning like there's no ifs ands or buts about it alright my mouth is feeling raw this color scandalous whoo okay now this looks like to be a bronze metallic and it looks stunning in the bottle and like okay girls I complain me let's see how she looks so this one is a tiny bit more I guess a little trickier than the other ones maybe it is the shade and the metallic so I'm just adding on a little bit of a second layer and then it's like fully fully opaque so this is like the only shade so far that I've had to do two coats on it I don't really gravitate to metallic Browns with this color it's definitely unique and almost has like a little burgundy undertone to it and here is a scandalous swatch all right now last but not least I want to swatch one of these satin shades for you and this one looks like a gorgeous type of like watermelon cherry and this one is called a Versailles let's see what these satin formula a feels like by the way you guys my mouth is raw it's like but um the show must continue all right so I'm not sure if the satin formula is supposed to dry down completely or if it's just like a satin liquid lip and it kind of comes off so I'm going to give it a little two minutes here and I will be right back all right so it's been about three to four minutes let's do a little finger test okay definitely came off a lot more than the matte one so maybe this one is not completely dried down and it's not a good tiny bit of a shine to it just say satin so I'm going to assume that it doesn't completely dry down but I just want to make sure on the Box it's really it doesn't say it but okay anyway I think that I have tried all three formulas and did enough shades to come to my I'm sure you can already guess from just my thoughts throughout the video but the Dior Rouge and liquid lipsticks are they are jeffree star approved I am really really happy that you're killed it with this formula they have been on a roll lately from their highlighters to their foundation everything I know you guys just thought the Dior forever in my July favorite girl I just got a text message man you want to be a nude photo in the liquid lipsticks were really great the formula was pretty much consistent of course except the dark brown at the end needed two layers everything else so amazing the formula was on point and of course I forgot to do my infamous smell test in the beginning but I do want to let you guys know that these if you've ever smelled the jort lipstick whether it's a stick lipstick or gloss it has a classic like it's floral but with a touch a little bit of something in there a little Dew or magic and it's just very fresh it's nice its pleasant it's not overwhelming like some brand girl it's very nice so overall I'm really happy with this product thank God I was scared because you know that's you know liquid lipsticks you never know but this brand killed it and I think these are going to come out in the month of August I think it's this week they're going to be on sephora.com or in stores I think if your location carries you're alright you guys thank you so much for watching another lip swatch video also if you love lip swatch videos I do have a playlist here on my channel click playlist when you click on my actual channel tab and there is a playlist of just lip swatches from literally every brand on earth all right you guys thank you for watching and I'll see you on the next one muah 
yeah welcome back to my channel alright so I'm really really excited for today's video we are going to be testing out the brand-new Pat McGrath mat trance lipsticks listen bitch I saw these online the other day the sneak preview and I was like oh my god they look fucking bomb now Pat McGrath laughs did send me all these lipsticks today so I am dying to try them out now they look something like this of course you guys have seen the iconic Pat McGrath sequined bags by now she has come out with highlighters she's come out with eyeshadows and they're all in kids she's had lift kits with glitter and these are the latest items that she is releasing these are a matte stick lipstick but the formula allegedly is more unique than the average matte lip now they do come in these kits and I have all three of them today these are a limited edition so I don't really talk about people that have inspired me because there's not a lot of makeup artists growing up that I was like obsessed with but Pat is one of those just iconic unreal amazing artists so when Pat first released some of her products and she was announcing a makeup line I was so like giddy and excited I've definitely fell in love with her skin fetish highlighter they are blinding and unreal so I am going to open one of these first this is the so there's different like versions they each come with three lipsticks for these kids now I do want to note that these will be sold individually for $38 she's a luxury brand y'all and then they will come in these trios which are $95 and then there is a everything kit that includes all nine lipsticks and that retails for two hundred and seventy five dollars these will be available on Pat McGrath calm and then of course she is a brand that is known as Sephora so I'm sure these will be on Sephora calm and in stores so first of all let's open these bad bitches up and see what happens I'm just going to take some scissors going to go right in here now I love this packaging it's very like medical glamour I love the sequins actually save them and maybe go swimming in my bathtub with them when I'm not filming once you open it up you guys you see the sequins are encased with the product so we're going to take out I'm sure that's one lipstick would even fit a little name right there and then of course there is another one and then there is the third color so let's open up one of these and let's talk about the component the product the way everything oh so here is the component for the lipstick I know you guys cannot feel this through your screen but it's a nice weight it feels really good especially for a luxury brand on top it does have a little black moment and of course the shade names are on the bottom I love when you open it and it has the lips still on it so I think it's really cute you know my bougie-ass is like for pictures and Melilla so then of course we're going to twist it up oh wow I mean we all know what a matte lipstick normally looks like this just looks extra matte I want to say like I know it just looks different than a normal like matte lipstick it looks cool alright promise just unwrapping all three of them look at these shades like oh I don't know if you guys can see this on the screen but the actual lipstick looks like a petal off of a rose they just have a unique texture I'm like a little shook about it basically this a lust collection for lips is a provocative colorful Avoca fucking amazing product basically and this is past cake on a matte lip this is her brand new formula that's kind of I don't know if it's ever been done before so basically it says that entrancing color that satisfies with supreme hydration okay so it supposed to be hydrating opulent matte opacity so it is supposed to have a lot of coverage and it also says that you can flaunt your fixations Orly and it's luxurious richly pigmented formulation that cloaks lips and in light weight veil of rich color I'm my girl that sounds good and then it says like a good lover this lipstick lays down a high impact with a strong finish now of course I want to prep my mouth before every lips watch a video I ever do I always prep my lips with lip scrub so I'm going to go in with my own the lower lip scrub in flavor watermelon gum if you are a lover of candy or anything sweet the flavor of Gumby for you so I like to take a little bit on my finger and just go to town you're not substitute for a meal girl okay so the weight of this product I do want to mention it it is 0.14 ounces that's pretty good for a lipstick so that's awesome now this shade is called obsessed and I guess I'm just ready to get to swatching now of course let me do my favorite thing on earth let me sniff oh my god this is like literally odorless oh whoa how cool I mean you know I love flavor not intense flavor but wow it's like there's no there's no fragrance okay cool alright I am ready to get to swatching so let's see what the hell these are going to do to my mouth oh [Music] holy shit okay one swipe coverage ain't lyin okay literally I'm like scared to tell you guys how much I'm over already obsessed with this because I know I'm like girl Pat if you are watching this you just kill the lipstick game this feels so lightweight I feel like there's literally nothing on my mouth it went on so easy I'm like scared to say this out loud but this might be like the easiest matte lip I have ever applied it's really hydrating it feels good it doesn't feel gummy or sticky or hard or it is so lightweight my I like my clothes my eyes like suppose like nothing's on my mouth and first of all the color the pigment you guys saw like a one little oh okay damn I'm like alright um I'm shocked all right the next shade is called full panic and it is a stunning bright pink how does it look on my mouth let's find out [Music] all right here is a full panic it is such a beautiful pink now I've kind of strayed away from pink lipsticks because I've been wearing them for 10 years and needed to maybe switch it up a little bit but this is beautiful same exact formula now once I try like five or six shades I'm kind of figure out like okay is this brand consistent or do the shades kind of change you know sometimes the liquid lips one shades great the dark ones are weird with this but this feels identical to the first one and I'm liking it so far alright the next shade is called Elson it looks like a true beautiful matte red it looks something like this and let's put her on now of course this is cool tone which I love cool toned Reds [Music] now this formula is very consistent with the last two so I want to swatch a few of the nudes and then maybe one or two of the dark shade so let's get into it all right I just opened up the nude set this is called the skin show these little three and I'm going to do a few for you now the first one that was really like gravitating to me you guys it's called 19 and 95 what the hell is I didn t 95 probably got to suck my first deck so this color just look stunning already I'm like let's put her on to Matt you guys these are so easy to apply the point at the end definitely helps like shape your lip and it's like literally the same formula which I love there's no inconsistencies so far and I am really happy okay girl work alright the next shade we are going to try is called flesh 3 it looks to be like a dark kind of warm tone nude and let's see how she looks [Music] okay this shade is really cool it's almost like a like red based warm terracotta brown nude the list goes on and on but I really like this color stain formula last name everything girl okay all right you guys I wanted to try one of the dark shades from the vicious Venom's kit now there is one shade that was really like calling my name it's called deep void and when I opened it I was like oh my god is this like a black lipstick but it's actually a really like blackened purple plum and I'm like girl I gotta fucking try this out the inner goth kid in me is like alright let's see how she looks holy shit come on pigment okay now with really dark colors they can be unforgiving so I am going to go in with a little lip brush just to perfect it so I don't look crazy alright so I have been touching this up with a lip brush now the only thing I think because this is so dark and there's a lot of pigment to it it's kind of skipping a tiny bit and what I mean by that is like when you you can like on that we're going to zoom in right now and you can see like a little bit here a little bit in there and a little bit here as I'm manipulating the product it does skip a little bit so I'm just going to take this now that my mouth is lying and just kind of go over problem solved it filled in beautifully out of all of them I think this one was the only one that I had a little bit of like trouble putting on and as far as the matte formula it just have a little bit more like a shine as you guys can see it's not like a hundred percent matte like the other one but it is a stunning color alright you guys I think I can come to my final conclusion not that any of you are going to be shocked here but the Pat McGrath mass transit sticks our efforts are approved I really really love the formula of these you guys everything from the packaging to even the shade names yes I love a good shade name these are just really really good quality lipsticks I had no idea what I was about to get into of course you see things online and you're like okay great let me see it in person and this is one of those products that was even better than my expectations because I really didn't know what to expect of course there was a few other shades I did not swatch but you guys of course got to see the majority I hope you guys can gather your thoughts and opinions from what you've seen in this video but I am really happy with this formula and I hope she puts out more shades because yeah girls hugged all right you guys thank you so much for

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we're unveiling the blood sugar pressed pigment eyeshadow palette and girl I know the internet is dying to see we open this box so let me jump right into it today we are of course going to show you the entire lovesick collection from jeffree star cosmetics which features the coveted blood sugar palette now oh my god I've been working on this for months and I'm so excited to finally show you everything it is a different color story than my previous palettes of course beauty killer and androgyny were very unique on their own and they have their own moments and now it's time for the future so 2018 here we are my brand of course turned 3 years old just a few months ago and it is just so unreal that everything just keeps growing and you guys are loving everything that I'm putting out so first of all before I even unveil everything thank you for the support and I literally do everything for you guys so seeing the feedback from the packaging so far before you guys have even seen me open everything was like crazy so thank you for that that really just made me even extra excited to just show everything so this collection is all red of course red red red girl we are in the red season I have done pink for so long I'm like what is next we've done chrome we've done yellow we've done white cap we've done black we've done hologram we've done pink we've done everything so I'm like girl what is next red chrome was speaking to me I love it it's almost just like a Valentine's Day Terminator type of vibe of course you guys are gonna see everything in a minute I think it's time for me to shut my mouth and show you guys the palette now blood sugar of course is my third palette and when you buy it BAM it comes in a box like this now look I am so excited to show you guys everything so we're about to pop this baby open but before I even open this I do want to say I wanted to create something a little different now in the makeup industry I know a lot has already been done before so it's like what can you do for a palette I was very inspired by like doctor medical boxes I'm very into the medical field in general I love reading books and watching documentaries on Netflix I am just a very into that whole thing so when I was thinking of a theme or what to do I started to create these shades in the lab and they were very like we'll see in a second I know everyone they're very like you'll see the story it's just different so I wanted to show that with the box this comes in a I'm gonna say a VCR like box if you don't know what a VCR is they're ancient but you pull out the palette like this so of course you can see the clasps right away all the info is on the back and this is kind of like a book like moment but everything of course is here all the product info now let's unveil her let's open her up she slides out like this and of course this is a little thicker than a normal pallet so of course you guys know the androgyny palette is very thin this one is big this is like a literal box so you see the difference now this one is heavy not like overwhelmingly heavy but girl you know I love a luxurious expensive feeling box or packaging so this one definitely has some really nice weight to it now of course we have the clasps where you open the packaging and are we ready for the unveiling all right you guys here is the debut of the blood sugar pallet so when you first open up the pallet you will notice that the pan sizes are smaller than my previous pallets now listen these pallets I took it there when I first launched my brand I wanted to go really big like go big or go home and these are massive it takes people months and months to even hit pan on this so I thought okay we're gonna do 18 shades now beauty killer androgyny had 10 I want to do more so when I was thinking of the design I'm like okay we're gonna make the pans smaller but I'm gonna show you a comparison right now compared to a Mac Shadow these pans are still very large so I'm going to show just a normal eye shadow of course this is not me shading anyone I'm just showing you a comparison because so many people I know we're going to ask so here is the size of a mac eyeshadow which of course is a little circle so you guys of course can see the comparison these are still really big pan sizes and because the internet wants to know all the damn t i'm literally going to pop one of these shadows out that i've already been using and show you exactly how big they are so here is the size of the pan it goes in deep so it's not like a really thin where you literally get like no product you get a nice amount of products so that is the pan size for this of course now I did make a component that had 18 pans with being huge size that are in these girl it was so bulky and massive I was like no one wants and no one's gonna want to travel with this or carry this around so I did make the pen size smaller but you still get a lot of product now of course everyone is gonna be asking what is the price now I did have to charge a few more dollars in my previous pallets of course there is eight more shades and you are getting this amazing packaging that is very custom so the blood-sugar palette will retail for $52 I tried to keep it very fair now for $52 if you divide everything that is literally two dollars and 80 cents per shadow girl you know what it is so I want to be very fair with this and I think you guys will agree for this type of setup and how many shades there are I think $52 is a very fair and of course everything else in the collection has the same price as the previous stuff so let's dive in and talk about the colors now there is gonna be a million swatches all over the internet there's gonna be a lot of tutorials including one in a few days on my channel so I'm not going to do a bunch of swatches all over my body I feel like when you're showing off eyes shadow it's really all about how you apply them with the brush or what you use I think digging your finger in and rubbing them on your arm is all right for some Instagram moments but literally no one is going to apply this entire palette with their fingers that's just not realistic so I think when people show off their pigments or anything a lot of the times I've even swatched a palette from other brands where it looks beautiful on the arm your swatching and you're like oh my god and then you put it on the lid and it's like crazy and not great so I think showing finger swatches isn't it's like we're gonna show you all the colors of course right now and I'm gonna like dig into some but let's go through all of them from top second and third row now a lot of the shade names are medical dentistry desserts sweet it's very like all in that realm so the first shade is called glucose of course it is a pure matte white I have never created one yet and I just love a matte matte white so you will notice there are three formulas in this palette of course we have the iconic matte shades and the matte formula that is in my previous palettes and there are three metallic shades right here we have blood sugar sweetener and candy floss and then we have a high-bred breast pigment which is like almost glitter foil and metallic in one next is sugar cane it is a very soft cool tone Brown perfect for in that crease if you just want to do a transition shade easy next we have cake mix which is a deeper brown that is very nice for building and just creating a perfect flawless smoky eye and then next we have outch which is a even deeper more warm tone kind of camel brown color I love this all over the lid next we have donor which I'm just gonna swatch this now with my finger it is so oh so creamy it's like hi there it is a very blinding so I'm just gonna do a little swatch even though I don't like finger swatches I'm gonna show you guys real quick just how easy that is to apply now metallic shades I like to taking with my finger sometimes and Pat them on the lid and then I'll take a brush and do extra and just kind of go in there and soften it and then next to complete the full brown smokey eye moment to get that look we have intravenous here which is a very beautiful more dark warm tone chocolate brown so of course if you are afraid of neon colors this top row will be your best friend but if you're into diving into a little more fun the rest of the palette will definitely intrigue you now candy floss which if you do not know that is what people in the UK or England call cotton candy now when I travelled there for the first time ten years ago I was dying for dessert and they had this like bag and it said candy floss and I'm like this can't cotton candy and everyone's like duh that's what we call it here I love that name so I used that for this beautiful metallic pink shade I actually have this one I need my little wand so I have this shade right here today just to give that extra little pop of color next we have this matte shade which is almost like a it's like a soft orange tone like it's it's different I love it it's called Tong pop and it's really great for in the crease very good for a transition shade just like sugar cane or cake mix it just has a little bit of like a flavor to it and this today I am wearing blended out really very softly up here and of course we have glucose below the eyebrow so on the brow bone now we have sweetener next to this this is a full-on blinding metallic shade is very pretty it has pink tones and it's kind of peachy it has a little bit of like golden undertone it is bilal as' alright next we have a cavity of course now if you have been following me for a long time you know that I have had a lot of dental work I've been haunted by my teeth problem since I was a baby you guys I've had like 30 cavities from a baby to an adult I've had eight root canals I've had my whole entire mouth restored it has been a crazy journey okay like one day I'm gonna do a video storytime about that and show you guys the before and afters it's scary and I am wearing cavity all over here today now next we have o+ now that is a more muted cool-toned gray brown I love it it's really good for transition and also for mixing with the bright colors if you want to dim them down a little bit alright so root canal is a vibrant ultra violet purple pink hybrid it is so stunning we actually use some of it today to mix in here it is just a very bright color packet on the lid put it in your crease put it in your inner corner it's for you baby let's go down to the third row as you see the shade prick has a needle stamp into it instead of the normal jst logo I wanted to do something a little different so I did different stamps for these corners now this shade is called prick so I used a needle so that color can see it Pat it all over my lid it looks so pretty like it's such a vibrant color it's probably the brightest shade in the palette besides cavity now moving on next to it is I had to create a matte red shade so cherry soda is red it is straight-up red I've always wanted to create a red shadow I've been wearing red shadow as probably since like literally eighth grade like my first color ever if you've watched some of my story times I wore a red eye shadow in eighth grade to school and they called my mom like girl we got to talk and I remember stealing that rusty red color from my mom so - the cherry soda we also have another one called fresh meat which is a more dark like Mulberry burgundy shade perfect for these mixing in like I live for this color this one is actually under my lid right under here em and then blended out with cherry soda now next to fresh meat we have blood sugar of course I named a shade after the palette and this is a straight up rusty red I'm actually gonna just touch with my finger I hate rolling the pans so it is very like dark rusty I love it I want to smoke out my entire lash line with it we'll just show you a little red right there boom I live for red shadows and then next to blood sugar we have extraction which is a darker version of fresh meat as you can see the tones are very different this is more red and this is like a straight-up plum burgundy color and last but not least we have shade coma which as you can see the medical symbol is embossed and there and stamped in and I put the shade today all in here and mixed it so basically I'm wearing a lot of these colors and I just went and actually I didn't go in lipstick NIC went in and we have a lot of tutorials coming up of looks she created for this beauty campaign and the entire palette we're gonna recreate them of course for my channel so that will be coming up shortly alright you guys so as you can see here is the entire blood-sugar palette of course before we even dive into the other products I want you to pause this video I want you to sound off down below and let me know your immediate thoughts now that you have finally seen it I think that this one is very I'm gonna say the word wearable because there are so many looks you can create with this and I really can't wait to see what you guys all do with it I am just like over the moon and on cloud nine right now also the packaging is faux leather I wish there was another word for that because it sounds weird it's fake leather it's not real so of course you guys know my brand is vegan and cruelty free nothing has changed here also I do want to talk about so this is a pressed pigment palette if you have ever used the Urban Decay electric palette or other stuff like that Mac has pressed pigments basically we're gonna give you it guys a little science lesson right now so when you use a vegan formula Red's pinks purples and that nature are really hard to perfect and make amazing so if you want smooth creamy mattes you want the pigment to be off the chain you've got to use red dyes because if you are a vegan brand you cannot use carmine now what is carmine carmine is what a lot of brands who test on animals or who are not cruelty-free use in their pigments to really get rich red shades now what does carmine you can do a quick Google search I'm gonna tell you right now it is basically crushed beetles that people use in makeup to get red pigment I wish I could make it up it's been happening for years so carmine is actually very common in cosmetics it's safe but if you are not into wearing insects on your eyes you have to use pigments so a lot of these red dyes can stain the eye area so on the back of the box you will see that it says some of the shades are not really allowed near the immediate eye area so you know me I am always gonna keep it 100% with you guys you see my eyes they are covered every color is on my lid today so basically it is kind of a warning for people with sensitive eyes so if you were someone that when you wipe off your makeup you don't want like your lids stained pink or any like residue in there then you might not want to put it around your media area nothing crazy is gonna happen you're not gonna go blind nothing wild it's just legally I have to put that on there because there is red dyes in here just like urban decay and Mac I always want the best for you guys so that's why I made the decision to make pressed pigments as well as eye shadow so you will see the shade names half the palette are pigments and half the palette are regular eye shadows alright let's dive into the rest of the lipstick collection so we have a lot more to this collection and I just want to insert this of course everything will be down below if you forget anything but this entire collection does launch February 10th at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time that is 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and if you don't know your timezone do a quick search now on February 10th everything is coming so I'm going to show up everything we have we of course also have some velour liquid lips now I really wanted to do something fun with the packaging so I know a lot of brands do not do this type of tech but I wanted to really just take it there so with the boxes I did a really cool it's not hologram it's not holographic it is a different technology that I found when I visited some trade shows in Italy in Japan and I found this company that does this it is on Rio you can pick different patterns and shapes into whatever you want I first debuted this with the Mannie mu8 collection as you can see see this how this moves it is literally a heart so it literally has like this side of a heart almost like the you know when you go has one of the sides on the box so as it moves you can see it go crazy and it's a very like eye catching and I love it in this collection you get four of a lower liquid lip and we are going to show them off all right now I'm actually wearing one now with some gloss it is called self control and of course all the packaging is in red chrome so this shade is a beautiful lilac purple shade and I threw some gloss over it what is the gloss I don't know maybe you'll find out later this year the next shade is called Romeo it is a gorgeous kind of like neon coral pink hybrid cult color we're going to just give her a little swatch right here now this one is very bright okay it is not for the faint of heart it is very like it but it almost could be summer but bitch we're in winter so you can wear this all year long and this shade girl I am obsessed with it alright the next shade we have is called problematic it is a gorgeous berry shade that is just straight-up like hi we're here we're not playing games we're just gonna swatch this right here BAM I'm gonna put some more on there you know hand swatches are never pretty you guys but hey this is what we're doing today so this shade is buildable it's not streaky but it is like a color that you definitely can layer twice if you want but you don't need to I'm actually gonna swatch it self control for you guys so you can see it matte and dry and not with the gloss over it that is that is a very opaque such a pretty lilac like girl work all right and the fourth shade from this collection is called a restraints it is this beautiful cool toned gray metallic now this is a little bit of a different metallic formula I'm working on something new so let me know how you guys think or feel about it when you try it it is of course still pigmented as hell but just a little different type of metallic so this one is definitely buildable if you want or you can wear it like with one swipe coverage as always but I just love this shade it's different from what I've put out before and these four together like what do you call it ombre with four from Bree quick reminder in case you are new all of these will retail for $18 just like the pink capped ones so these of course are staying the same price moving on now let's talk about the Leppa munition there are three shades now two of them you may have heard of before we'll talk about that in a second but of course this comes in the same beautiful crazy box and when you open it you get a red chrome bullet of course with this silver tip I love how this came out I'm just like Oh livid die first of all let's talk about the two existing shades now these are not lip ammo shades these are actually liquid lip shades that I turned into lip mo because they are so highly requested on my girl we're gonna do with you so first up we have androgyny of course I had to make a lip M oh girl this is literally my number one most sold liquid lip of all time so we made a matching lip MO same creamy formula same creamsicle scent and this goes on one swipe coverage stays on for hours a very creamy satin finish the second shade is Calabasas now this was my number one sold lipstick from last summer oh my god you guys came so hard for this and it's a city I live in baby I had to make the lip ammo so of course same exact shade as the liquid lip but of course in the satin finish so ignore of the lines in my hands as you guys can see it is the same shade just different formula and I live for this the third shade is called sinister it is a gorgeous berry shade a little darker than problematic a lot darker but I live for this shade you guys ever seen someone swatch on their hands like this this is what I'm doing today let's just go up my whole pinky like girl look at that yes bitch one swipe coverage you better work we have not one but two JSC handheld mirrors now of course we have the hot red to match all the packaging and in a deep plum brown color which I live for also a lot of you have been asking away the pink ones are coming back in stock girl very so maybe a week or two after them they're on the way production is like they know you guys sold out of this  so quick so of course since the makeup bags had such an amazing response I want to start doing more of them so I made a holographic red one this might be my favorite one of all time I thought the blue and the black we're killing me like we know I love pink right now but the red oh I love this now if you've never seen these before we have little star logo emblems on them and we have the logo right there a pocket in the front and then there's actually a lot of room in here for all your stuff so I know a lot of you were like can palette fit in there are you sure and I'm like girl you know I got you so the beauty killer palette can go right in there of course you can put in the androgyny palette if you will you can put lipsticks in the front you can put them inside and where's the blood sugar palette is she coming on my next trip girl she's coming hold on I needed two hands for that so you can literally put all your palettes in there and you are ready to roll you can fit in like with lips lipsticks compacts anything you want and you were all set so these will of course retail the same price as before this is $25 and the mirrors where you at are 20 right almost last but not least we have three of the lower lip scrubs and of course they come in Chrome a red packaging as well with the same unit carton and we have three flavors ever since summer this product I know I don't post about them often but you guys slay and kill this product they have been like just selling crazy I'm like high like after the blue raspberry sucker and the watermelon gum it was a wrap so I'm like okay orange soda everything those are actually coming back they've been so highly requested so we brought them back once gone again they're coming back but for now the new flavors are and this might be my favorite one we have cherry soda now literally God if you're a cherry person you are going to be obsessed with this one I've been diving and into this one a lot I'm sick I'm like mmm it's like you can taste the fizz in your mouth it's uh it's so yummy if you right fruit person or loved cherry suckers candy or gum this is gonna be your new favorite all right the second flavor is candy necklace who wore candy necklaces as a kid you take them you bite them off I wanted to capture that essence and that fragrance and it literally is like so nostalgic when you smell this you are going to die now if you do not know my lip scrubs are edible of course they are vegan they are infused with aloe vera and a vitamin E so they leave your mouth and skin feeling full lawless now I did of course different sugar colors for everything I can't so before you put on any lipstick doesn't have to be mine of course you can't use this and it will leave you like some mood and also you can use them for dry skin I'm not kidding if your forehead is feeling a little alligator girl do a scoop rub relax all right now the third flavor is chocolate covered strawberry probably one of my favorite things to eat at night like girl mmm you know what she got the munchies it is so yummy and I did the sugar a little baby pink now I've been using this one and scooping it out and of course if you do not know these are also hand made so everything is handled with care so those are the three flavors let me know down below which one is your favorite so let's just watch you barking a girl all right you guys know last but not least this is gonna be a little mystery okay I know you guys are maybe gonna roll your eyes and want to slap me upside my head but for the February season mmm we have a new mini liquid lip bundle hi and the shades you'll have to see in a future video all right I know I'm annoying but I just kind of wanna do something different I'm sure a lot of you can

What’s up everybody? Welcome back to my channel. Today I have Laura Lee in the building.
- Hi! Hey girl, hey!
- Hey! Okay, so today... what the hell
are we getting ourselves into? Girl, today we have something, new,
fresh, it’s gone viral somewhat. My pap smear results?
-Exactly. We’re reviewing though. We’re so sick. - I know, we really are. But that’s why they’re here, obviously.
- Yep, that’s right. Sorry you guys, we have the giggles,
because we’re obsessed with highlighting. If you didn’t know, me and Laura have reviewed
so many highlighters last year, like, what? Yes, every fucking highlighter.
- Every highlighter. We were in.
- We were in. So, pull up the picture. So this meme, and this product has been going viral all over
Instagram, all over Pinterest, I’ve seen it everywhere. And basically we saw what?
It’s like a little oil bottle? Yep, it’s like a little bottle called Unicorn Oil,
it looks pink and it’s supposed to give you, like, this pink beautiful highlight, just showing
the picture that advertised... been advertising it. Now, this picture has been going viral everywhere, so I don’t know if it’s from the company
– Right. If someone made it, we really couldn’t research it.
And, so the brand is called Glow Cult Cosmetics. And today, we have some products to review. We’re going to do a little – ching!
- Ting! A little first impressions. So, we have all three
of the illuminating glow elixir. I love that word. And then we have the “Do Me”.
- The “Do Me”. Honey I could do you, we got to ask our husband’s permission.
- Yes. I’m not married. No wedding ring yet. Okay, so this is the rose water priming and
setting mist, with a guest glitter in it, allegedly. So, we were looking up this brand
on Instagram, Glow Cult Cosmetics. There’s no Instagram account for it.
- It’s gone. Yeah. It’s like it’s blocked,
or gone forever. Like, people have tagged them before, in the past.
And then the Instagram is gone, so I don’t know why, that’s kind of weird.
- It’s so weird. But, they do have a website and that’s
where I bought these products from. So, a little info about this product you guys.
It was a little weird though, because there was no logo
or any branding on the bottle. Like, the website’s not on the bottle so I was even trying
to look up the website and I couldn’t find it anywhere. And when it came in the package, it didn’t come in a uni-carton,
so there was no branding info, there was no ingredient list. It was just, like, sitting in there.
Yeah, no ingredient list, so. Now, there is ingredients on the website,
thank God, because I was getting a little iffy. Like, I’m about to put this on my face.
- What is in here? It’s a little crazy. So, these are it. Basically once you get it, you guys, the product is like,
sitting at the bottom, if we can show that off. Yeah, because I was a little bit shook because
of what it looks like on the website. Yes. - You get like, a clear – On the website it is, like, blinding glitter in a bottle.
- And then this is it at the bottom. So you have to shake these up, which it says
on the site, so that’s not a negative for me. But at first I was like, what the hell…
- Yeah. Is going on here?
- Yeah. Like, girl, did I get a bad one? Exactly. So basically you’re supposed to shake these really well.
Which we’ll just shake them all, we’ll let them sit for a second. Show you guys. Yeah. So this product says that it is a glistening
moisturizer perfect for use on bare skin. Okay, well we have foundation on.
- Yep. But it also says it adds an illuminating effect to your foundation, so if you add it in.
- So you… oh, like… Kind of like a cover effects thing.
- Okay, cool. And then you can’t put it on top
of make-up, I guess. But there’s people saying maybe use like
a balm highlighter, and then put it over. Over the balm high… oh. But oil over balm? That’s a little weird for me.
- It’s strange. So it says that this illuminating pigment oil adds
the perfect amount of glow and warmth to your face, while lightly moisturizing
at the same time. So, it’s $27, which for an indie brand, I was like…
- And it’s so… I mean, it’s just small. It’s small. So this is 1.5 fluid ounces. That’s a little small.
- Yeah. The ingredients: coconut oil, micah powder and vitamin E.
Okay, so these are all hand-made in Los Angeles. Oh, I didn’t know that. Yeah, and it did take like 10 days to get here.
I was like, “Oh, my Lord”. I ordered one too, it’s like, sitting at the house.
- Oh, cool. Okay. There’s one thing I want to call out,
I do have oil all over my hands. When you open the package, they had already like,
almost like leaked a little bit. Yeah, like it’s outside of the little sponge,
it’s a wet oil. It is definitely like that. And these are screwed on tight. They are. So I don’t know why
that happened. Little weird. It’s a little weird that there’s no ingredients on the bottle, of course.
- And no, like, website or… Branding, nothing. - Brand of the company. So, you might want to put that on there, everybody. So I guess
we can try this. I want to… first we can try it on our hands first. Yes, for sure, for safety. For safety. I want to see if they’re actually glowing and amazing, because
the picture’s we’ve seen, you guys, have been a little blinding. Yeah, they’ve been insane, and I think that’s…
and, I think it’s like all over Pinterest, it’s all over Google… Everywhere.
- It’s just like, those pictures. But, if it’s oil and the website says you really can’t put it on your face after a full look…
- Yeah. Why did that picture look so blinding? Yeah, that’s the problem. In the picture she obviously has on make-up, so how…
- I know. Does it look like that?
- So, I don’t know if a fan of the brand made that or the brand itself made it… Yeah, because the brand may have not made that picture, but…
- Yes. We can’t figure it out.
- We’ll see what happens. Okay, so what do you want, do you want to try the pink one, the glitter one?
- I’ll try glitter. Let’s both try it, let’s try them all.
- Okay, perfect. Give this a really good shake.
- Let’s shake it up. Yeah. Here she is. Give me a drop, please.
- Okay, I’ll give you a little drop. Okay, it looks glittery on here. It looks just like oil and sparkles. Here, put some on your hand, too.
- Yes. We’ll do it at the same damn time. So we’re going to try
to show this off. Oh, it’s dripping, oh, it’s dripping. Very liquidy. Okay, we’re taking our bare fingers,
and then we rub in. Oh wow. So this is grease. And that’s all that this is, is like… Oh my God, there’s like really no sparkle. There’s not much sparkle at all, it’s just like, wet. I would freak out
if this was all over my face. Honestly, just honestly. Whoa, it feels really wet. Wait, turn on the flash on your phone.
- Okay. Is there glitter, or not, like, for real.
Because right now, there’s like… It just looks like the warmth off your light,
you know what I mean? Okay, let’s hold it this way.
- Yeah, no. It looks wet. It just looks like I dumped my hand in baby oil, almost.
I’m like, rubbing it on my knuckles, on my whole hand… Look at this.
- Oh, so you… it’s easier to tell on her, you guys, because I have full tattoos.
- A full tiger. A full tiger. But let’s look on your hand.
It’s like, barely like… I mean, I’m obviously really close to her hand,
and so I can see a tiny bit of shimmer, but… It dispersed the glitter into almost nothing,
and this is heavy, guys, like there’s no way… Coconut oil is heavy.
- This is clogging pores, right here. Whoa. Doesn’t smell like anything. It smells like nothing.
- Nothing. Like, absolutely nothing. Interesting. It’s kind of weird there’s vitamin E and coconut oil.
- Yeah. Doesn’t really smell like anything. Okay, let’s wipe it off.
We’ll try the next one. So the glitter one, I don’t know right now. Yeah, that one’s a little greasy, little heavy. Hopefully these have a little bit of pigment to them and we can
really see like, some pink and some holographic looking stuff. It still looks wet, it hasn’t dried. Before I wipe it off, let’s do a little
like 2 minute moment, and just see if it dries. See if it seeps in. Perfect. We’ll be right back. Okay, so it’s been, 5 minutes.
- 5 minutes, I would say. We chatted, we gossiped.
- Go through the (inaudible). It’s wet. It’s the same. - It’s still wet. This is so crazy. So we were just sitting here talking about like the ingredients
where it said coconut oil. When I take off my make-up… A lot of people use coconut oil. A lot of people use coconut oil, they use it after their
make-up’s off to like, moisturize under their eyes. So, what is it you want to do? So I want to put a little bit of foundation on my hand,
because it says on the website you can mix it in with your foundation and get like a luminosity, luminy glow.
- Okay. So I’m going to mix it in and see what
happens with the oil and the foundation. Okay, amazing. Oh, you’re using the Lumiere? It’s not even my foundation.
Let me pump eight pumps out. You couldn’t even use a, you know, a drugstore foundation?
- Only Lumiere will tell the truth. Okay. Great. Alright, well Laura Lee’s going in
with a, okay… no, it’s one of my favorites. Okay, so here’s the dropper. Let shake it so we’re keeping it really real.
- Do the honors. Alright, so here we go. One, two, or more?
- Yeah. Two, but it’s like its breaking up in the middle of the foundation.
- Whoa. Okay, so let’s take the back of a brush. Alright, get in there. Oh wow.
- Okay, that just turned this beautiful Lumiere into a little oily. But, like, guys, I say oil weird wrong,
because I’m from Alabama. Can’t help it. If you’ve never seen her previous Rolls Royce Get Ready video,
go check it out, it’s going to be linked down below. Okay, anyway, come on free promo.
I’m promoting myself on my own channel. So if you put this on your face,
would it dry? Like, I need to know. I’m going to do this.
- Okay. I mean I’m not doing anything else tonight, but girl!
- Okay, she’s going in. I don’t want to mess up one of your brushes,
let’s just dab it in. Oh you can. No, no, no, no, here. Girl, we have
so many brushes, use this, this is the Sicily brush. He gives me the most expensive fucking brush. Oh, it already looks like grease on my face.
- Does it? I’m screaming.
- Here, zoom in, zoom in. I’m screaming a little bit. Oh, it’s wet. It’s almost like when you’re
brushing it on, I can see the brush hairs. It’s also streaky.
- Yeah, it’s streaky. No, that looks wet and shiny. Would it dry though, like…
- We’re going to find out. My hand is still wet, by the way.
- I’m literally so harsh, I’m like, “No, that looks so gross”. Oh, it does, I was ready to make a dirty diaper joke,
and then my brain froze in fear, actually. So this has been about what,
we’ve been talking for another 5 minutes. Yeah, 10 minutes.
- My hand’s wet. I couldn’t imagine that, just like on my face, like the wet, so…
- Oh no, it feels like baby oil. Touch my hand. That’s… oh. Okay. I’m going to wipe this off now,
because I’m like, uh uh, girl. Girl, not all over your sweater.
- Don’t play me bitch. Okay, now the one that’s been going viral online,
let’s try this one and see if there’s any difference. Okay, how does your foundation feel?
- So, if you can tell, it just feels sticky. Okay, so from looking at it from the side view,
guys, it looks shiny right here, and then it’s completely matte where your
bronzer contour is. It looks a little, like, damp. Yeah, you see the shine when you turn your head.
Come on, Vanna White. Yeah, it looks shiny. Well, I don’t want a shiny face. No.
- I like dewy. I just would never put like, oh, or oil in my foundation. I would never put oil… - Oi, in my foundation. Okay, now here, lets shake up this one.
- Okay, let’s give it a go. So let’s go on the website, this is… oh my God,
my finger is like glued. So this is the iridescent rose highlighter. It does say glistening moisturizer, it’s glistening on anything
we’re doing, so it’s kind of doing what it says on here. I just didn’t know glistening was like wet looking. Yeah, not only that, I don’t know,
like I don’t know if I would want… just, it’s heavy, and I don’t know if I would
put that all over my face as a moisturizer. Yeah. The product is heavy, not the glass.
- Yes, it’s just the product. Let me mix a little bit of foundation and then
you try just it by itself on your hand, maybe… Okay, perfect. Yep.
- Let’s see what happens, guys. Right, let’s take a little drugstore… Giorgio Armani.
- Luminous silk. Yes.
- Just kidding, this is my favorite, honestly. Alright, I’m going to do two. Do you see how it just slices
through the foundation? Whoa, let me try to show it that way,
dripping everywhere. I’m just going to use the brush. I mean, luminous silk is already luminousy,
like is luminousy a word? I just made up one. Now it is.
- Whoa. I’m done. No, I’m just kidding.
Okay, let’s see what happens. I’m like, so quiet because I really don’t know, it’s not awful.
Just sort of looks less wet than the glitter one. - Yes. Yeah, actually. - So maybe this one’s a little bit less...
like has that greasy feel to it. Maybe it’s the glitter… no, the glitter
would not make it oily. Okay, so the pinkish, so the iridescent
rose isn’t that bad, I mean for mixing, but I still don’t see a glow or anything, do you? Oh my God, that’s literally just oil.
- It’s literally just oil in a bottle. And what it looks like in here does not
translate on the hand, holy shit. That… Just clear, it’s just clear.
- It’s clear baby oil. Well, that’s what it looks like. It’s a $27 bottle of clear baby oil, and that’s my first thought…
- No, I know, that’s my first impression. That’s my first impression.
- Same ingredients on this one as the last one. Okay, so no different ingredients, like… There’s no… do you see any luminosity or any…
- No. Glittery feeling? Nothing, right? It looks flat. So I mixed it with the foundation,
like it says, there’s no glow. No. Like, the girl on the picture
just seems so pink and frosted. This is just, like, clear. There’s no frost, there’s no pigment.
- There’s no frost, you know, there’s not an actual pigment in this, exactly. So… I guess the final test of time would be their version of a setting spray…
- You better not be doing anything tonight, girl… Let’s give that a whirl.
- Girl. Alright, so now we are about to try the “Do Me”
rose water priming and setting spray. Let’s see if it, I want to see… I’m kind of nervous.
- Okay. Jeffree just shook it up.
- It looks kind of cool in there, it’s almost like a lava lamp. It looks really dope.
- So now this is $27 as well. Good Lord. Now that packaging, it’s cheap. Yeah, this is a dollar at the dollar store, little… Okay so this is for anyone that is dry,
normal or combination, so that’s everybody. So any kind of skin type, basically.
- So this is for illuminating and refreshing the skin, it is a conditioning setting spray. This beautiful and balancing mist with rose
water extracts and botanicals to help hydrate, restore and soften the skin, while giving
you a gorgeous glow. Shake well before use. Okay, you did that. It’s vegan, it’s cruelty free, which is awesome.
- Okay. Now, it’s supposed to cure dryness, dullness and uneven
skin tone, how do you fix uneven skin tone? Especially with a rose spray like this.
- With a full covered foundation is what the hell you do. So, ingredients. Rose water, witch hazel,
aloe vera and natural micah. So for those of you who don’t know what micah is,
it is basically like glitter pigment, if you see pigments, or anything like that,
there’s micah in them, so natural? I don’t really know what they mean by natural?
- Right. With skin care. I mean, it’s weird to mix like a glitter
with rose water. So, we’re going to give it a whirl. I kind of want you to spray my hand.
- Yeah, for sure. And just see if there’s any glow. Let me wipe off this foundation.
- I’m so nervous. Okay. Okay, hit me.
- How far back? Right here? Okay. What does it smell like, to you?
- A little bit rosy. Okay. Okay. Is there any glitter? Your hand looks the same color, you can especially tell
through the tiger because your skin’s a little lighter right there. Is there any micah, any glitter, any shine, shimmer?
- Nothing. What the actual fuck?
- Yeah, there’s like nothing on my fingertips either. Now that it’s dried. Let me hit your hand.
- Yep. Okay.
- Alright, that was a good one. I mean, it’s just clear. It’s just a clear rose water. I’m like, shocked. I mean, where is the glitter? You look at it, and like, you would see bronzer
on my hand on the bronze bit, but it’s clear. How do they get it to look like this in the bottle…
- I don’t know. But it sprays out like, clear?
- Like, that would be coming off, you know, my fingertips. Yeah, what the…okay.
- Alright. Well, I think it’s time to give our final thoughts. Alright you guys, to say that I’m disappointed, Laura, would be an understatement.
- I agree completely. I’m like…
- Right off the bat when we started, when there was no website on the bottle and it was greasy whenever you haven’t even opened it,
I was a little turned off. I’m not going to lie. Now, I know this is an indie brand from, I guess, you know,
like the internet, from Instagram, but it really fell flat for me. Like, I’ve used some dope indie brands on my channel. Literally I have found $5 lippy.
I mean, just, amazing indie stuff. But, I feel like this is literally
$27 like oil with no pay-off, there was no shimmer, no glimmer, no diva moment…
- It’s just like baby oil. It was, yeah, like there was no… it looks cool in the bottle,
so if you want to, like, take a picture of it… Or like, with it or something.
- Or hold it with your hand, maybe like your best friend. $27.
- Maybe you can put it in your passenger seat in your car and you do car pool with it. You paid for it.
- You can take it to the movies. Something. You don’t want to put… It will pour out in your fucking purse,
and ruin your bag. I was about to say it might leak out in your purse. Well, I will say this, it’s cute to look at…
- Yes. But this was a big, epic fail…
- This is a no. This is a no, so, is this Jeffree Star approved?
- No. Is this Laura Lee approved? Hell, no.
- No, girl. No.
- You got the wrong one. Honestly, no. No, it’s not okay. I was mad that we didn’t get to really wear highlighter today.
- I know. I thought we were going to put this on our cheeks.
- Let’s just make this video fun. Yeah, let’s put on highlighter, I’m sorry.
Oh, there we go. Well, now the video’s fun.
Look at my nose, it’s like… Alright, on that note, thank you guys so much for watching this video.
Also, we did another video on Laura’s channel. What did we do?

video that just went live where my man does his makeup so Nathan transforms Manny into a sexy sultry they okay so today we're not driving into makeup we are going to be reading me comments that we get every day so if you guys aren't aware on the backend of our YouTube pages there is a section called held for review which is basically some of the nastiest evil and moment I've ever heard of my life we get called nasty names every single day all the time all the time now that here's the thing guys I've been online and I'm living my life online for a long time now these words do not mean anything to me what about you same I they are managing to me now I mean I've been on social media for a couple years now and in the beginning of hurts slightly more than it does I mean doesn't at all now but they're getting a little more like this is really weird and uncomfortable and people that didn't know me or calling me these crazy names I was like wait I don't understand yeah but now that I've been

may sound a little silly what got you into reviewing all this amazing expensive stuff you know I am a luxury brand for a lot of expenses makeup I love designers and I really fell in love with all your reviews because you know a lot of people think oh well if something expensive of work you know and it doesn't and I think I was out to prove that because I was in where one night I was in Neiman's and I saw the Louboutin lipstick 9200 expect that's kind of what started it all yeah this was a couple years ago yeah first watch those I was so excited I picked it up and I asked what the price was and my first response was literally like what the fuck yeah when they told you yeah there were 93 years know they're 90 yeah they're nice and you're like oh I'm like I'm the packaging is funny it looks like an Egyptian like crazy is going to decorate a Christmas tree with a little video a little ornament but I felt like it would be a really fun review and I felt like it would be a really cool first impressions to kind of this resin is no one had really refuted to you and went viral and it's for having me to try more expressive makeup okay and it kind of just kicked off from there I love that when I was first looking at YouTube stuff when I was starting my channel I was like okay all I wear is a lot of this expensive shit are people going to be like weird about air they going to be different everybody's been so cool to the plane was it just me I don't want to speak something or not well yes and I think lately I'm really happy that so many extra brands or certificates or formulas

really real with my audience I just share some things that I think are important and I think that you need to open up even more and obviously your audience love just so much I personally really loved it I loved what you had to say about your relationship obviously but also for the imprint that I connected with was people hating on you for being successful or we're getting to this place because I didn't always have a very big life I really came from nothing and I know that you have a similar story oh and like I love that you remind people to get inspired instead of jealous where if you see someone with a nice bag and I play a nice anything you want that and come up with your plans oh yes yes and execute it and never give up I mean it's taken ten long years I also like short years didn't but it also a long journey of you know from a all the way to be and I think people forget that because they're just seeing me now I think throw I think people I don't know what they think but it's like didn't know me even three years ago yeah now there are two bedroom little apartment you know not sure how to put food on the table for me and you know and my family may need help yeah I'm helping pay rent for people while I can barely go in a tent but you know I'm trying to find food for my dogs and it's just like you know it's a while to see how people react to success and I think it's so bizarre that people are so negative people don't know how to be inspired anymore because there's just so much negativity on there well the other thing that we'll know is it's not quick you don't just like think of a dream and tomorrow get a you gotta find that mountain you got to get to work and you got to put yes exactly and I think people forget that right no I liner over here on a plane hmm I

What's up, everybody? Welcome back to my channel. Today I am with Jasmin, she is the head
of artistry of Lancome for Education. And where are we today? We're in New York City. Headquarters, Lancome.
-Yes. -Yes. So, we're at the headquarters today
and it's snowing outside. I know, I know. Come on, snow. This hair though. So, basically you guys,
I am really excited today because we are going to test out
the custom foundation machine, but what is the official name? Le Temps Particuliere. Yes. And this went viral, you guys. I know most of you have already seen this
all over Instagram, on SnapChat, on Twitter, so many people tagged me
and they were like, “Jeffree, you have to test out this machine!” Now, the technology is amazing. We're gonna talk about that in a second. So, for everyone at home, that is wondering
where they can test out the machine, 'cause I know it's fairly new, so
it's slowly popping out, right? Correct. Where can they find it? So right now, it can be found
in Nordstrom Doors, there are 11 select doors within the country. And to find those doors, you can go into
Lancome-usa.com to find the listing. Cool. And if you guys have any questions
or where to find it, everything will be linked down
in the description box below. So, what are we gonna do today? We're gonna match me to an exact match. We are going to match you. So, what's so special about Le Temps
Particuliere is that it really does give you your customized blend. Yeah. We scan three areas of your
favorite skin tone areas, so what you love about your skin tone,
those are the areas that we scan, we need three scans to complete
and get your exact match! And so there will be only
one match that's yours. That's amazing. And it will come up with an amazing complexion ID,
that will be unique to Jeffree Star. Cool. So I do have some light make up on today. They're all gonna read at home, so
she's actually gonna wipe it off, so we get an exact match, 'cause you
can't match with foundation already on, that's... Absolutely not. That's cheating. So we're... That is cheating! But what's so great is that
we are able to scan again any area of the face, neck, I mean, any area
that you love and so it's really all about the calculation of those different skin tones
that create your one, precise match. That's amazing! Okay, cool. Well, we're gonna get started. Let's wipe me down. Yeah. So, let's do a little removal.
- I'm excited! All right, so I'm just gonna
push this hair back, and we're gonna let you remove
these 10 layers... no. All right, good for you? Amazing, yes.
- All right! And now, what are we using to remove the make up today?
- So this is Eau Fraiche d'Isere, it's actually for all skin types and it really does an amazing job
of removing any and all make up. So, when you don't really want to wash your
face, all you need is Eau Fraiche d'Isere. All right, so we're about
to start our consultation. Yes. I've never been scanned before. I'm excited. So, what's so great about this system
also, Jeffree, just so you know, it's customizable based on your skin type
and your coverage preference, so no two formulas are alike. Okay. So you can change the coverage of the formula.
- Absolutely. Okay. Absolutely, so first it's your skin type,
you will be... are going to create your profile in our system. And so, you are gonna
tell me your skin type: dry, normal, oily and then
your coverage preference. So, let's start with your skin type. I am honestly, I just have normal skin.
I'm never oily. Beautiful skin. Thank you. I think maybe living in California it's just, I don't
know, weather, I don't know what it is, but like my skin's just always normal. So, it's never… It's in your genes. Good genes, thanks, mom! So, yeah, I would say I'm pretty normal.
-So, we will say normal. And then, coverage you know we're doing full. This particular formula will
end up as a natural finish, so more of that second skin finish
and a veil of perfection. I love that. As I would say, so no filter needed
with this kind of foundation. Okay. Okay? So, we're gonna go full. Okay. And next is our scan. So, Jeffree, to start the scanning, Yeah. What I need from you is Okay I need you to look into
the mirror with me Okay And I want you to show me
the areas that you look to match when buying a foundation, so where are
your tones that you love the most? Okay And we will need three. Okay, so we'll do the side
of the cheek, love this area. Amazing. And then, I feel like my neck
is sometimes a little lighter, so maybe we'll do here? Okay. And then, I think we'll do the forehead area. Perfect. Yeah. For your neck, I'm gonna find a space
that's more flat surface, maybe here. All those tattoos, watch out for grandma! All righty, so we are going to
start with the forehead, Okay.
-okay? So, cool, so it's just scanning in. And capturing that very precise measurement
that will give you the overall, once we're done. So, it will let you know like
it's a good read or not? Yes. So, when I scan, if there's
any light that goes in, if there's anything that kind of can
distort the actual calculation… It will reject it? It will reject it. Oh, cool, okay, that's good to know. All right. So here we have a perfect read. Ooh, okay. We get a green, good. It says we're good.
That means we're good. Okay. And then... So, then what's next? So what's next? Okay, we come
to this amazing page, which I think people are
dominantly fascinated by. Because very few people know
what their undertone is, so that's a huge question out there, especially for our foundation customers, right? And consumers. Yes, a lot of people don't know their undertone. They don't. And honestly, you don't
learn that overnight, it's not something that you learn in school,
you have to be very into make up. You should. Seventh grade, what's going on? What is your undertone? But when you look at this page, this is
the page that actually tells you, how much because I know that we
said this at the beginning, but it takes four colors
to make any foundation. This system can calculate and
detect up to 20,000 shades. So, an enormous range. Yes, 'cause there's so many people out
there that have such a hard time finding their... you know,
their foundation color. Yeah. That's like a struggle. It's crazy, like a lot of other brands
have so few selections, I'll see a brand come out
with a new foundation, and there's like eight colors, I'm like, “Girl.” Exactly. I mean, we come in all
a whole lot of colors. Every undertone. And every undertone, so you know, Lancome
is definitely there, if you have any... with this particular system, it is unlimited,
to the people that we can match, so it's every one has their perfect
match with Le Temps Particuliere. But here, you can actually see that how
much red you have in your formula, how much yellow, how much
black and how much white. Which I think is a pretty... you'll probably never
need to know these numbers again. It's cool to see, yeah, I've never seen it. And it also shows where you land on the
scale as far as warm, neutral, or cool. I'm like in the middle. You're neutral and I can tell just by
looking at you with a little redness that comes through, there's
a little neutral in there. I know that's what you don't want
us to capture, so we won't. But yeah, you definitely
land in the neutral area. And as you can see, we said normal,
so it added moisturizer and no thinner, so that pretty much calculates
our overall formula. So, what would thinner do, thin out
the formula to make it more sheer? Correct. Exactly. So, if you were to tell me that you
wanted sheer, then it would… If I ever said sheer, everyone
at home is gonna slap me. Right, so that's, we will continue here,
and then we're ready to blend. Yeah, so now we're ready
to make your foundation. Yes, this is so exciting for me,
I'm just gonna hold this up for everybody, so I've seen this so many times
online, it's so exciting, so basically it's going to give
me my own label, right? With my name on it? Absolutely.
-Serial number. Super personalized. So, now I can always go back
and they can remake it, without going through the process, right? So, I'm in the system forever. You're in the system forever, your bottle
will have a complexion ID, that will be pulled up in any Nordstrom,
where the foundation can be found. So we start with a little plastic bottle. All right, so oh wow, okay. And that's what's so great
about watching it, I'm always… I can't tell you how many
bottles I've made. Yeah, I've never seen it up close. And watching it, is always
like the first time for me, 'cause you see all these
pigments dropping. Yeah, so right now, it's dispersing
the pigments to mix. Unprecedented accuracy based on your... I can't believe it knows how to make
my skin tone, it's just so crazy. Oh wow. There goes the red pigment. You'll find, that once all the
pigments have dropped, you see that half of the bottle is full
with pigments and moisturizer, and the reason for that,
is because it's adjustable. So, if I matched you and say, you know,
sometimes people think they want their perfect match,
and then they say, “Ooh, I wish it were a little darker” And so we can adjust it
and make it deeper, we can make it brighter,
warmer or cooler, so it is… So, let's you do a little test drive before
you totally finish, that's amazing. I have to say, though, I trust
100% the accuracy level? So when it says it's gonna
give you your perfect match It does it
-It does it. Okay, cool. But if you, as the client, aren't happy,
then we will do whatever makes you happy. Okay, cool. So Jeffree, here's your foundation. So crazy! See all those colors? Wow. So, then the next step is shaking it? The next step is we're gonna
blend it all together. All these amazing shades, so we're gonna
put it into our shaker, and this is where it It's blended. This is also very cool to watch, just a little... And if you're at home, start twerking. Slowly but surely we're getting there. It already looks like my skin tone! That is crazy. Okay, so we're done shaking,
let's take a little peek. Oh wow, it's all blended! It's all blended. How do you know it's like blended enough? So you'll see little veins, you'll see you can
check on it, so if you give a first go, and it doesn't blend enough and see
kind of like these little white veins Give it another go, and some foundations,
depending on how much red and how much yellow and how much black
is in there, they may need a little bit more. But you'll find that the foundation
color in the bottle, is sometimes not what people expect. To see, 'cause they're like,
“Oh, that's a little lighter” 'Cause they're used to… Because they're used to something else. And so because of this formula,
once you put it onto the skin, Okay. It sort of blends in and the magic happens. Wow. And so, you'll see it blend in. You'll see it… Wonder if those people
ever tripped out, right? Completely, because they're like, “Oh, that's too light, that's not my color” or “that's too orange” or you know, it just really picks
up on those undertones. All right, okay, so we're do a little skin
prep before we add the foundation. And we're gonna start with our Genefique. Now, funny story I've been using this for
a few years now, on and off, and I love it. So, we're gonna start with Genefique. All right. And then, we're gonna add a little bit of Bienfait.
It's actually, it has SPF, so that's the reason our Le Temps
Particuliere is has no SPF, so this has an SPF 30 and it's a pretty
basic moisturizer, all skin types. And it's normal lotion, then it is a cream. I'm excited to try that, 'cause I've never
used that product before. Smells good, I'm all about scents. So, we're actually to the third step,
before our foundation, it's always great to add a primer. Right? It sets the skin beautifully, and this is our
Smoothing Effect Oil Free La Baste Primer and it's amazing. Cool, I love some oil free. Actually, we're only going to put it in the areas
that you could typically get oily. Okay. And it's usually like… little bit, I get shiny on my
nose a little teensy there. Okay, so we're gonna do a swatch Of your perfect match. And then, I will blend it into the skin,
I will do half of the face, so that you can really see the comparison
one side to the other, and what a beautiful veil it creates. Can you tell right away
that it's a good match? Actually, if you look at it,
initially, it's a lot lighter. Okay. And then it sits in, I'm gonna blend
it in and see what happens. And this is actually the preferred
method of application more of a stippling motion,
because it has a skin finish. Right, so you want to blend it out. And so you want to blend it out. And what is this brush? I've never used this before. This is actually the brush that was
created for this particular product. Okay. And what's so great about the brush is
that you have this other opposite end, to get into the places that are a little bit… All the nooks and crannies. All the little nooks and crannies. All right, Jeffree, are you ready
to look at yourself? I'm nervous! All right, woah. So I'm really, you know,
I do have some discoloration which people at home think I don't. Up close, I promise I do and… It's very mild. It's like literally cancelled out like
everything, it looks very natural. I'm like looking side by side comparison
and it looks beautiful. The match is pretty spot on,
like I didn't know what to expect, and it's not like too dark,
it's not too light, literally looks… And for, yeah Like a perfect match, honestly. I mean, I'm sure they can see, too right? 'Cause it's so… I'm like It really has just created this amazing
veil of coverage, slight coverage, not super full coverage, so again,
that skin, I see your skin. Yeah. But this is a good everyday, like when
I go to the mall, if I'm going out, you know, just a normal errands, I don't want to wear ten layers
of foundation and concealer. So, this is a good everyday moment, I feel like. I'm like shocked at how great
it looks it's like really... And here's what It doesn't feel heavy, it's really light,
like I really feel like there's nothing on my skin. How does it, it feels fresh, right? Weightless, honest, it's crazy. I'm like… It is weightless, it really is. I'm shocked that it doesn't
feel like anything, almost. Super lightweight, super lightweight. And it's a water based formula so there's
nothing heavy or any ingredients that are… It's so crazy. I'm like not over it. That's evened you out, huh? Evened me out. Yeah. It looks beautiful, now what what
we're just saying off camera, everybody is that this is so perfect
for like the average girl that does not have an hour
every morning to get ready, this is perfect for going to the office,
going to school, it neutralized everything. I'm feeling flawless, it's very… I still can't get over the lightweight-ness,
like I've probably said that 20 times by now, but it feels like I still just have moisturizer on,
like it feels amazing. Because it gives you that fresh feeling
for the entire time that you're wearing it. So cool. Yeah, so it's actually Amazing. Super special. Yeah, so what's the next step? So, the next step is we are going
to personalize your bottle, so please tell me what you would
like your label to read. Let's just put my name. Okay. For everyone at home out there,
my legal name is Jeffree Star, I get asked that all the time. Everyone's like “What's your real last name?” I did get it legally changed, ten years ago. So here you have your complexion ID, Jeffree, you can see this complexion ID
will show up on your bottle. Wow. And it is unique to your foundation match. No one else has this complexion ID, So it's like so when I do run out,
I can go back and just give them the number
and they can whip it up! That's so cool, okay, awesome. That's so cool, it has everything
already to roll. So you can take on the box,
everything. It's so cool. It's really luxury meets artistry,
meets technology. Here is your personalized. That looks so cool. Le Temps Particuliere, with your name
on it and your complexion ID. I've never had a foundation with my name on it,
so this is pretty awesome. It's pretty special, right? This is a first for me How does it feel when it has your name on it?
-It's awesome, it's so cool. Yay. It's all yours. Thank you so much! I'm so glad you like it. It's so cool, hi everyone! Amazing. So I know everyone at home
is gonna be asking a few questions, so what is the retail price
for something like this? It's $80, but that includes a full consultation,
you saw the consultation, So you get the scan, you get someone
explaining everything, you get the full consultation. It's an experience. It's Le Temps Particuliere experience. It's so cool. And to end up with your perfect match,
I mean, for many women, I can say that for myself as well, as a Latina, it's very hard for me to find the right shade. It's priceless. Yeah. The experience is priceless, when you
end up with your perfect match. Yeah, and I think that foundation is an investment,
I see a lot of people at home, mixing all the time, they're buying several things,
or just doesn't really work for them. I see a lot of people buy things and then
it doesn't work out, and then it's like-- And then it's a waste. It's a waste. I think this is a really cool investment,

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel how are ya alright so today I am really really excited because we have another Mean Girls moment on my channel now I reviewed the brushes last month from another brand called spectrum I know you all remember this and if you didn't remember this video where you never saw it I'll link it down below but today I'm really really because we are going to dive in into the new storybook Cosmetics Mean Girls burn book eyeshadow palette that was the sexiest sentence I've said in a long time so if you've been following this channel for a while you know that I have reviewed this brand several times now they had the infamous rose makeup brushes which of course we're jeffree star approved we also reviewed the wizardry and witchcraft palette earlier this year on my channel so this will be another book in their series of palettes I love this brand they keep killing it and it's pretty hard to impress me time after time but girl they ain't slowing down and this formula was sickening but is the burn book the same formula is it going to work out and is it cute enough for our hearts if you are a mean girl fan you are definitely going to love today's video and if you're do someone that loves makeup keep on watching baby but if you want to get ready with me grab some makeup brushes and a Red Bull and let's get started alright so let's talk about the packaging BAM for fifty-five dollars which is what this retails you get the palette inside of this beautiful velvet pouch and when you open it it looks like this oh and here is the palette it comes with its own book cover slave which I love so it does have a lot of info on the back everything about this brand you guys they are first of all they are an e-commerce brand which means they are only sold online kind of like my brand so if you want it you got to go on their website now the burn book eyeshadow palette is cruelty free there are three formulas we have matte pearl and shimmer I think that's what the last palette had yeah I showed her names are to die for this brand always takes it there with it like to the next level and that's what I appreciate the cool thing about this is that you can line them up on your vanity so it literally looks like books like I live I die okay great now I don't let the open her up here is what you get to pour $55 ah now this palette is very different than the last one I love it the colors speak to me they're very bright and fun but also very you know we could wear this for the fall now I'm someone that wears pink eyeshadow year-round so this palette does have 12 eyeshadows I love the names you guys Regina George she doesn't even go here you can't sit with us alright this pot looks fun you can definitely create some crazy looks with this now that's what we're about to do so I have already primed my eyes with some Mac painterly paint-pot you guys already know that's every video of course by now so that is already primed and ready to roll now today and serving some little alien Barbie glam I have no eyebrows on because who needs eyebrows when I don't know most people I guess sorry okay so we have no eyebrows on today we have Nathan on my mouth which is nothing new but you guys always ask what lip color I'm wearing hey let's get started now I love to lay down a light color from lid all the way to brow a lot of the times I'm sure if you have been watching me for a while you know I love a light base so we are going to take the shade the plastics with a little Mac synthetic brush and let's see if the formula is good or not just looks like a matte formula to me now I love this brand because they I don't know why don't I haven't tried this yet but in the past they have perfected the matte formula with not like crazy crazy fallout as you see I'm hitting this over and over and over that's not how much follow up baby all right so let's press this on my eye oh hello I might do this I'm like looking in the monitor you guys I'm not even looking in the mirror I'm like ah yes no I do have deep set eyes so I do like to take the lightness and bring it even like higher which of course if you have a different type of eye shape you will not want to do this by the way this palette does have a very ginormous mirror which I should be utilizing right now instead of looking in the monitor all right so far so good if the plastics laid down very nicely it blended beautifully so let's move on let's take this little morphe what is this the 441 little blending brush and what do I want to do today these orange some Pink's are like speaking to me God that green needs its own tutorial I feel like I'm like can I touch it right now we're touching it oh you guys know I gotta just do a little swatch right here oh look at that bitch okay so let's dive into so fetch first no I'm lying we're not doing that we're gonna do you can't sit with us then so fetch then Wednesday we're gonna get a really colorful up in here so let's just hit this a few times and full pigment on the brush already but does it blend well let's take a peek all right let's see here yes crease you better work now I'm not gonna connect it all the way down here I'm gonna kind of leave it as like kind of like a floating crease and just give my lid some breathing room and I'm just gonna take this and just kind of go like that and then just flick out so it just kind of goes like this very lightly and soft all right you can't sit with us is laid down in the crease it is very pretty if giving me like I just love it now I'm gonna take the Mean Girls spectrum brush that I have been using for under-eye powder and everything else I'm actually gonna take it and hit it with the plastics and I know it's a bigger brush and you probably like what the hell are you doing and I am then going to take that and just blend out the coral ish we're gonna call this color peachy coral and just kind of go over it like mmm there we go and that's gonna make it very seamless and blended out so the next color we are going to dive into is so fetch it is that one right there it's like a hot Orange it's pretty okay so we're gonna grab so fetch on this little packer and we're going to put that right in there and then once again we're gonna take that the shadow right on the end just kind of go up this way there you go and if you have a face tattoo be careful not to get anything on it all right so I'm trying to decide what I want to do with this look oh my god first of all that looked like almost like a dark slate blueish gray and then on my finger it's like holy I'm gonna put that right next to the green which of course has faded because I've touched some things but oh that's silver though I'm like what are we gonna do I did I kept this blank you guys I don't know what I want to put in there part of me keeps being like no we're not doing the green we're doing the green we have to so I might smoke out my under eye with the green I might plop it right here but Wednesday the pink you guys it's like calling my name so let's go in with a little oh come on now I'm gonna press this like halfway on my lid kind of like it's a liner but not and let's see what happens here I was brushes kind of fluffy so it's like maybe not the best okay that is  sheer girl I don't believe it the other shadows can not be that good for that to be that we're trying it if a brush alright there we go this is a packer brush what you're supposed to use this for not living dying and breathing for this color but it's still doable it looks like it's a little bit more like it's obviously matte it looks good so we're share than the other one as far as payoff I am NOT living for the pink so we are packing and packing now the white base could obviously affect that who knows but let's just go right in there BAM now I do also want to note that this shade did have a lot more follow than the others we can just zoom in right there obviously I think the pigment worked it's not the best and Pink's are very hard to do I understand that but girl alright I packed the pink color on I'm loving how it's looking now for this little weird part right here that I left open I am gonna take the Urban Decay heavy metal glitter and shade grind and we are going to just pop that on there now I like this wand and I've been using this for literally they've had this out for what 10 years I want to say I like it because it puts it on a little at a time so if you're like hey I don't know if I'm gonna go overboard you can definitely go very minimal and then bump it up so it's not like oh I put too much on okay you guys well for the first time on this channel ever doing a tutorial the fan alright so the glitter nothing wrong with the glitter I've used it before I love them but sometimes when you put glitter on top of bright shadows they tend to get weird the wand was picking up pink I put it on the white on accident hit the fan I  it up so I wiped off the glitter I took the Packer brush and of course I put Wednesday all over they're gonna still glitter like all my lids still kind of I went that off though and then I took this little brush right here which I'm gonna do again and I'm gonna go into she doesn't even go here now this matte does have a lot more fallout than the others these two definitely do more than these three actually so I'm just gonna knock off some pigment we are going to just put that right into the crease and come back to life because girl life tried it I almost had to wipe off everything and I was like girl we gonna do that uh-huh we are back now the pink is a little messy pink shadows can be messy it did come under here like it stained a little bit so we're gonna put a shadow under there I'm not worried about it we're moving on everybody pause and take a hit with me because girl okay now we are going to grab the Mac smolder eye pencil nothing new here I do that a lot on this channel and we are just going to take this and put it right in our water lines all right you guys so now look I've been dying to dive into the shade obsessed looks so pretty I'm like you know what green pink it sometimes it looks hideous sometimes it looks crazy so let's give it a whirl I'm a lot of the times with metallics you know I love to wet my brush with fix+ or a setting spray but we are going to do this with a clean brush first to see how the pigment is and then we'll move on alright so let's do a little it was beautiful on my finger but how is it off oh girl oh they like really soft the brush is like okay I don't want to get a lot of Fallout on my face okay these are very soft you see it on the brush is it going to stay on let's pray here goes nothing a little shear with it dry I will say that not living for it I loved how it looked on my finger so let's use a little we didn't have any fix+ in here no okay we're just going in with this morphe spray this will wet the brush for us now let's try to go back into that shade one more time oh there we go okay look like rolling it around alright so let's give it a whirl now a lot of the times wetting the brush obviously intensifies things with any brand or palette so I am not mad at this and let's drag it all the way and just be obnoxious like hi are we Shrek are we serving Ninja Turtles what the are we doing girl all right the green is on it's making a statement and then you know what let's just take it even further we're going to dive into this beautiful shade and I'm gonna use this tiny little morphe brush well we see that you guys this really stuck to the brush as well no this is the tiny tiniest Packer brush ever and I'm just gonna see how this looks I mean if we already looked this crazy let's just take it there someone to press this right in the inner corner ooh okay silver you did not need any setting spray definitely feel like this one is a little bit different than the green obviously one had a lot more shimmer and this is like straight-up pearl silver so we're just gonna tuck that right in there Wow all right you guys I think this look is done I just added a little bit of benefit roller lash mascara no shocker there I love how this looks now I think I'm ready to give my final thoughts are you I have used it let's do a little camp you guys one two three four five six seven shades out of the 12 and definitely gonna have to do its own blue moment later on in life with this look but I think we're gonna give our final thoughts so let's dive into it so when I first saw this palette I was very very excited I am a very huge Mean Girls fan and I have loved the movie since it drops so now that we are here years later I love this whole thing I love the palette now let's dive into the cost $55 pretty good this is a I hate the word novelty because I don't mean it in a bad way but is they it is a novelty item if you are not a fan of the movie obviously you might not get the palette but so many people are and I think it is so cool that this is even in existence I think it should have happened a long time ago so a story but thank you for making this dream of mine happen now let's dive into the formula all right now the first shade loved it it was beautiful this shade as well beautiful transition this one amazing the pink was a little weird for me I think because they had the white shadow down it I've looked a little weird who knows it could be the primary you guys know you have to try things out trial and error but it did end up obviously packing on really nicely now she doesn't even go here blended really cute in the crease the green one was a little weird it felt a little chunky a little glittery but once I sprayed the brush and put it on there and packed it it went on really nice without spraying it didn't really love it it was a little kind of hard to work with the silver on the other hand beautiful I'm looking in here like BAM like it's stunning so that was the only problem that I had with that besides that you guys it wasn't like an end-all like this shade did not ruin the palate for me it was just a tiny bit hard to work with but overall definitely I think this pilot gets a 9 out of 10 I feel like if you have a problem with one chaired whatever of course we do have to try the rest of them out in a future look but the consistency is there just like their last palette the formula is there I love it and I think that they really have a hit on their hands so is the storybook cosmetics burn book eyeshadow palette Jackie Starr approved its Jeffrey's are approved hey Wayne star Trak aren't you guys I did really enjoy this palette I love this look it's just it's different I kind of lived for that green though baby so yeah thank you for watching sorry I'm all giggly and mommy took a few hits because when I put that glitters down y'all and it up I was devastated but we came back strong just like the Dodgers all right you guys thank you for watching this video and I'll see you on the next one 
Whats up everybody?
Welcome back to my channel. Today we are diving into this glamorous,
glowy, peachy, smokey eye look. I’m feeling the high fashion
fantasy, and yes, I might have sex after
I finish this video. But today we are going
to recreate this look. Now, I got so many requests
from about a week or two ago when me and Manny did our reading
mean hate comments video, you guys are all like what
the hell is on your eyes. So, today we’re going
to recreate that, and can we just talk about
the glow for a second? Like, oh it’s like burning my cheeks,
my retinas are on fire. We are using two highlighters
today for the glow, we’re also going to be testing out some
new Marc Jacob beauty products that have real coconut
infused in the makeup. Do they work or do they not,
that is the question. But besides that you guys, if you want
to see how I created this fantasy, then keep on watching. Alright, let’s dive into this look. So today, as you can tell,
I have no contacts in, these are my real brown,
hazleish eyes. Now, for a primer, today we are going to be going
into one of my all time favourites, the Sicily Double 10 CR Primer
this one is everything. So I am going to of course
coat my fingers and rub this all over my face. For a foundation today I am going
to be going in with something  I haven't really used
on camera before, it is from the brand Guerlain
and this is the Lingerie Foundation. Now this one is supposed
to be a skin fusion like texture where you look
amazing and flawless. Now let’s get a little damp
beauty blender and get to work. Alright now, for a concealer today I am going to be going in with the new
NARS soft matte complete concealer. I used this the other day
in a full face first impressions and I was shocked at how, like smooth it went on my skin,
I was like, oh, okay honey. So we are going
to be dipping it again, I’m just going to go in this
is mine of course, Im going to go in with the beauty
blender and get some on the tip. come on tip. and I'm just going to take this
and to it right under my eyes. Oh my god guys, this concealer
like melts into your skin, maybe because the Beauty Blender is damp and it like really works well with it. Mmm, the only thing I wish
is the shade was a little lighter, this is their lightest shade,
this is a number one, I just wish there is a little bit more but I’m going to add some powder in a
second and brighten it and set this face. Now I’m going to take my mac studio fix and shade shivering white with
the damp Beauty Blender, I’ve been doing this for years and lately I have kind of been you know,
I’ve been trying so many products I’ve been steering away from this but I’m
going back to my favorite trick of really like lightening under eyes
and looking lifted, so we are going to take that
on the damp Beauty Blender and what I’ll do is I’ll just take it
right under the eyes and I will press it in almost like an
upside down triangle type of motion and it just gives you in a look of like... Oh, her skin is fetch. Alright now we are going
to really set the under eyes in anywhere I put concealer,
like the chin, the bridge of my nose and
of course the forehead and I am going to go in with my
favorite setting powder of all time, the La Mer ‘The Powder’ and you guys know I had been
using damn Beauty Blenders forever to dip into the powder it melts right into your skin and
it is a nice little beauty hack and we are going to buff
that into the skin and you can leave it and just have it
sit there for a minute while it soaks in and you can brush
your way in a second. Now I’m just going to take
a little synthetic brush and brush off all of the loose powder and now its time to do
a little contour if you will. So today I’m going to be going
with a brand new bronzer that I just discovered at Sephora and it is from the brand Marc Jacobs, of course Marc Jacobs is
exclusively in Sephora. Now this is the new Coconut Bronzer, look how big the packaging is honey, yes! You know I’m a size Queen. Oh my god it smells so good, it’s like pure coconuts in your nose
and this shade is called tantastic, it is the mega bronzer and
this is of course limited edition in the beautiful white
extending packaging. Now it also has a brush
you can buy with it which looks something like this, look how big that brush is though,
look at that. Now I think you’re supposed to, you know
use the brush with this and go in, I’m not sure, oh wow,
that’s like a lot of product, so I might go in just a little bit
to see what it looks like, I’m scared it’s going to be really pigmented I guess there’s only one way to find out. Alright, I just bronzed up my entire face, we hit the cheeks, forehead,
jawline and nose, oh my brush smells like coconut,
I’m like hungry now, girl fuck. Now we are going to do
some highlight right now. My new favorite combination is peach goddess with eclipse
skin cross mixing these together, oh my lord. So I am going to take this
on a soft A23 brush and we are going to go into
peach goddess, ahh hi. Alright peach goddess is laid down and now I’m going to take out eclipse
and use a Morphe five 10 brush and we’re just going to gently caress
the moon and put that right over. Ohhh lord, help me now. Alright you guys have seen me
do my brows a million times, so I’m going to quickly
do them off camera with a little bit of benefit
precisely my brow and Anastasia dip brow
and I’ll be right back. Alright now let’s get these eyes started. Today we are going to be using
a YSL couture eye primer so remember to always of course
use a synthetic makeup brush when applying any primers. Alright now that the primer is down
I’m going to take a Ivory shade and put it all over my lid up
to the brow bone and I’m going to be really shady because it is a shadow that
I am working on for the fall and it’s not final so no one go
crazy and post about it, or you can post about it because
I love when you do that. But it’s just a shadow
that I’m working on that I’m not going to show
on camera yet because I don't know if I am
going to change it or alter it, but the fun thing about lab samples is that you can play around with it for a while
and tweak it any which way you want. So it’s kind of similar to my shade
china white in a beauty colour palette but it’s a little more intense. Now this eye look is really simple;
it looks a little smoky and dramatic, but I really only used like two brushes
and literally two eyeshadows. So we’re to pull out my Androgyny
eyeshadow palette and today we are going to, I’m feeling like Vanna White. Dah dah. Today we are going to be
dipping into only a few shades and one of them which is the main
star of the look is of course charm, my favorite transition color
for really any look and we’re literally going to start
patting this on our eye. So you’re going to take the brush, and you’re just going to start
in the inner corner and I’m going to go like this and that is like a little place holder
for where I am going to stop. So we’re going to start there and now we’re going to take this same
bus with the same of course shadow and we’re going to go all the way over. And then you’re going to take it and I’m
going to start going into my crease and we’re going to go all the way in like this and you’re going to stop it
right outside of the eye. And now you're going to fill it in and
do the same with the other side. So now I am just packing
on charm all over the lid and what I started off camera
is I took a blending brush and I just kind of feathered it out barely with any product on the end, you’re just going to go basically
in little motion like this, you’re going to blend up and outward. And now we’re going to take a tiny little
Mac detailer brush this is the 221 and were going to dip
into shade dominatrix this beautiful dark chocolate
shade right here. A little goes a long way with this one so I like to coat the bristles completely, knock it off a little bit and
then this is really say I’m going to put this right in my crease,
so I’m going to tilt my head up a little bit so we’re just going to massage
this into the crease and give us that really dramatic look. Alright now this eye look is almost done, we just got to smoke out the under, but before I so that I am just going
to go back into eclipse really quickly with the brush we put on the primer. And we’re just going to go
right below the brow bone and we’re just going to pack on some eclipse right on the arch of the brow just so it gives a more uplifted look. Alright now we are going to go in with one of my all time favorite black eye
liners this is smoulder from Mac and I am just going to put this on my
waterline quickly and then get to smokin. Alright now I’m going to go
back in with charm we’re just going to place this
right below the waterline and just drag it out and sometimes I like to tilt
my head so there’s no fallout. Alright so I’m going to take
another tiny little brush, this is the Morphe 507 and I’m going to go back into
dominatrix for one split second and I’m literally just going to brush
right below where I put smoulder, only like barely so it’s only going to give you
a little bit of a liner effect but like barely like a little
detail I want to add. Ohh, hi there. Now it is prime support master so of course y’all know about to go in
with my benefit roller lash mascara and then we’re going to put on
some falsies, so let’s get to it. Alright, now I’m going to
quickly pop on some lashes and today I’m going to go in with
the lily lashes in style Miami . These are really gorgeous
but not too dramatic, I want the eyes to really
have a moment I was like, hi I’m peachy and I’m here bitch. So I’ll be right back. Alright, lashes are on,
now it’s time for the lips. Today I’m going to be going in with
the Marc Jacobs liquid lip cream in shade, what is this one called again,
your’s to try. This is a beautiful, warm toned, nude color, I think it’s going to go perfect
with this eye look. Alright lips are on, oh I love
a color combo right now. Alright I think the only thing
left to do is set the face and not to sound like this is a
coconut March Jacobs whore ad, but they also came out with
a brand new setting spry and I just got this stuff in the
mail right before I filmed this, so I though why not,
let’s give this stuff a whirl. Now you will see some missing
because I was trying out the pump, I heard so many mixed reviews online and I saw my girl Jacqueline Helene
snapchatted a few weeks ago using this and a lot of people were saying that the spray came out
like really like I guess intense. I noticed that if you don’t
press down all the way, it does kind of shoot out,
so quick advice for anyone that has this or is about to try it, you have to go all way down and
then it creates a beautiful fine mist. So I saw a lot of people just kind of like venting or asking me have I tried this yet, so I haven’t tried it on my face
I just sprayed it a million times. So let’s see what happens. Oh it smells so good. I forgot to tell you what
this is called you guys, sorry, this is the perfecting coconut setting mist... recover is what it says on the bottom. Now I am noticing that it didn’t
completely dry down my forehead area but the rest of my face it did so I’m just going to take
this Beauty Blender and just kind of buff out
those little light coats, almost like droplets on my forehead and there we go it is blended,
pretty blended. Now the settings also said that it’s supposed
to lock in your makeup for like 24 hours, I’m like girl, I ain’t wearing makeup
for more than six hours. But I will let you guys know
that in the description box if this worked for me or not,
but it smells amazing, I mean all the coconut stuff is just like,  I don’t know, I’m like hungry right now, craving a chocolate bar with
some coconut shavings on it. But I’m with you guys, I think
that this look is almost complete, I want to change my hair
and do something different because so many of you are like, girl where’s your slay intro shots,
where’s the fucking wigs. Well be right back then. And this is the final look I am feeling
this high fashion glam moment. Look at this hair bitch,
slayed by David Scissorhands. Don’t fucking play me baby. I love this look I feel like
I could wear this anywhere, to Walmart, to the grocery store,
to a fashion show in New York. I’m just feeling myself right now but I hope you guys love the final look. I had so much fun filming it. I would love it if you guys
recreated this look if you have the Androgyny palette, dip into some charm honey
and create some magic. Thank you guys so much
for watching this video as always you guys are the best. I will see you on the next video. Mwah. Bye guys. 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today I have pimpled for the first time in five years and I'm depressed so in today's video we are going to be testing out a brand new full motherfucking coverage foundation from Laura Mercier you may have heard her brand it's been around for a long time but every beauty guru on YouTube uses her setting powder it's translucent it's amazing it's flawless I used to use this all the time on my channel and then I you know I started to use other stuff and now you all know the mirror is my tried and true but this one is a classic everyone uses it it's amazing that Laura Mercier has been around for a long time and their products are amazing I love it I also use their cream contour kit I've used this several times on my channel also you guys quickly I did not borrow blac Chyna's robe that Rob bought her this is my own from my own money but you know what do I look like I'm in the bed with her right now hold on hello guys so moving on today we are going to be reviewing yeah I got so many shades for you guys cuz you know I can't match myself online so this is the new flawless fusion ultra wear foundation now this is supposed to be long wearing it's supposed to last for 15 hours I'm like holy shit and it is basically a medium to full coverage on the box you guys it says that this is Laura the longest wearing foundation which seamlessly fuses to your skin with a weightless layer that looks fits and feels like a second skin well here's the real team so I've been wearing a different foundation than what I normally use for the last week right so every time I'm get ready I've been using a certain foundation and I have this crazy irritated pore on my nose which we are not going to zoom in on because this is like earth-shattering for me a besides that I got this little temple right here which is like what is going on girl what the fuck so I think that the foundation because I've been using it for a week my skin is like what the hell is going on like I review stuff obviously a lot but I don't consistently wear the same foundation that I review for a week straight unless I'm in love with it so my skin kind of having a moment so yes I am a real person in the motivating to this foundation it says a lot it says that it is a 15 hour long wearing oil-free transfer-resistant liquid foundation it is basically for every skin type it's a sensitive normal dry combination oily it's literally supposed to be for everyone also on the website you guys it says that it's free of fragrance it's derma logically tested it is sweat humidity and water resistant that's a lot of claims you guys I'm like oh my god I want to mail this to someone in Florida and let me know how it dirty minutes outside this summer as usual I got three shades I always like to at least get three to see which one would match and I did a little swatching off-camera and I think I'm going to go in with this one is vanilla so we got vanilla up in here and I also got a shade darker which is called a roux EC ru if I'm watching that someone slapped me so I'm going to use mainly the vanilla one and mix a little bit of this for the outer perimeters of my face now of course I know this is the first time most of you is coming with a pimple let's see it the foundation covers it when this foundation is $48 actually no Laura Mercier is a luxury brand and I love that this brand is putting out 20 shades to start I love that a lot of brands recently I've been putting on stuff and on my girl six shades or ten shades growing leesneed 15 to 18 if you're going to do a concealer or foundation that's just my opinion you will it need to have more but at least start out with 15 so Laura put out 20 shades and I'm looking on the website and yeah this is supposed to be like amazing oh my god by the way it's a new Beauty Blender you guys who's seeing this on Sephora calm I die for this it's like marble or Thai that I don't know what they're calling it so besides that you guys I'm going to test out the foundation of course we're going to do half my face Beauty Blender and the other half a brush just to see how they apply so I kind of want to take a page out of my girl tattoos look she will do like a wear test and I really don't do that on my channel I like go away throughout the day and I'll come back in the studio and kind of show you how it looks but it's still with all of the Beauty lights so I do want to kind of do what talk to you does for this video specifically and kind of take a gopro with me and Nate while we go out through the day and I kind of want to show how the foundation actually looks in the daylight at nighttime and then before I take off my makeup lighter because this takes 15 hours and I'm like whoo I'll probably up for another 10 hours so let's see how it looks all right so of course we have to prime the skin and like normal I'm going to go in with my favorite primer from Sicily this is the double Atencio primer this one of my like go-to always it is so just stunning and we're going to put it all over her face so do we gotta shake this I always take my foundations this does not say that apply to clean skin with Laura's foundation sponge bitch plays I'm using a Beauty Blender or with fingertips girl who applies our entire foundation and blend it out with their fingers oh I have no idea that's all I'm a full-coverage coin that would be a lot of finger movements oh and I do want to know you guys that this product is standard like most foundations it comes with one fluid ounce now I'm going to take this let's do Beauty Blender on my right and then we'll do the brush on my left okay I do not know how full coverage this is so let's just go slow at first and then we'll see what happens let's bounce okay so you really do got to move quickly because the foundation that's already up here is kind of drying all righty you can see how it's like a little more harder to blend out okay so that is the first layer and on camera I can still see my pimple it is a crazy one but it's like is that bad so looking close-up it does look like it's kind of medium I think I want to do like maybe another layer on top just to see what it looks like and I was going to use this darker shade but this one matches me like pretty spot-on so let's do another layer on the right side all right you guys so this second layer definitely a lot more full we're getting there you can still kind of see that but it's not that bad so of course we'll let that dry but now let's take the brush this is just a so for our pro dome the stippling brush let's put some one here now I'm just going to work this into this part of my face since we now know that it is kind of more it'll quick drying formula and let's see how this looks oh wow I can already tell the brush is making it apply more heavy which is probably what I wanted the first round but let's see alright Wow okay the brush definitely applied it I feel like more thick now let's remember this is a brand new Beauty Blender just unwrapped so of course it's going to soak up a little bit of the product so maybe that's why it wasn't as full as this but oh girl this side is looking even better I feel like all right now let's take a little bit more just another little drop right there and let's do the forehead area all right you guys so what I've noticed of course this is the brush side of the face this is the Beauty Blender for some reason I like the brush better which I am kind of shocked to they never say that but some products and maybe because it is brand new but some products don't work is the best with a damp sponge most of the time they do I will say that if we want to zoom in a little bit I feel like this side looks a little like my poor look a little bigger or like they're showing more in this area and then to me the brush side it's like poor forms I'm gonna put on the rest of my makeup I will put on my concealer and powder on camera and then I will go about my day and we're going to do some talk to you check in girl alright now we are going to buff in some concealer and I am going to use the Beauty Blender because that's what I love to do so let's see how it reacts with the foundation all right the concealer is blended out and it looks pretty great that looks really really nice over the foundation which I was scared because you couldn't no you never know even some primers even some primers do not really react well with certain foundations so it's all about trial and error people but I do think we should definitely go in with the translucent Laura Mercier setting powder it's only fitting so let's dip in here and if you've been watching me for a while you know I love using a damp Beauty sponge to set the eyes and the face wherever we put concealer so let's put a hefty amount on and let's get to setting okay so first impressions just with this over the concealer and now the full coverage foundation I'm loving this I am looking airbrushed I'm looking 16 and I am just kind of loving this look let me give you guys some quick little first impressions so right now as I'm like zoomed in on my own self I am liking how this is looking you never know how foundation is going to react my skin is liking it definitely covered a lot I mean all my discoloration is gone I look like one mask and so far so good but how will it wear you'll have to continue watching to see what the hell happens hey guys so I just finished my makeup now you guys know I am NOT a vlogger I don't normally ever vlog but I'm using a GoPro just to you know follow me around today and see how this foundation wears now it's been about an hour I would say and what do you guys think it looks pretty matte like really really nice I noticed it's like a little Creasy right here in this area which always happens to me and maybe a little around the nose but I don't know how it's looking on camera but I'm pretty impressed with it so I am about to film actually a lip swatch a video and then head out to an event so I will check in later alright guys so it is currently 8:05 p.m. I've had this foundation on for about almost eight hours I don't haven't really looked in a mirror in the last few hours but nate is here hey baby hey baby so how does my skin look it look like shit it look great how does it look I mean I still looks great to be honest does it yeah I mean it looks pretty full coverage to me so it is increasing maybe a little here no oh maybe a little bit maybe around the list my line and yeah a little huh yeah just a little bit okay I mean it's been eight hours with going strong and yeah I look good I don't feel Whaley you guys I don't feel weird my skin tools nice it doesn't feel heavy either like I don't feel like I have a bunch of makeup on right I will give it another few hours before I take it off and let's see how long it can last May I swear to God alright you guys I am so tired it is almost 11 p.m. and I'm a little shook we'll take a little close-up right here like look home mat that looks right there it looks flat okay laura mercier I'm a little shook at you maybe barely a little crazy bear a little here but like gonna go see Nathan in the mayor he's helping me get some lighting up in here you already know um you guys I gotta say I am really impressed with this blows fusion foundation I think we had a hit on our hands if you are someone that loves a full-coverage mask I would definitely check this out I think it was worth the price point I'm looking the mayor my forehead is so smooth after like almost 11 hours that's pretty good for me without really touching up yeah I think this foundation is it's jeffree star a proof there Savannah goes over for this is something new all right you guys thank you so much for watching today's video I hope you loved the review for everyone out there that loves a full mask I think we have a new favorite of ours all right you guys thank you as so much for watching today's review I will see you on the next one one good night 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today we are going to be trying out yes I'm holding one of the items we're going to be trying out today we are going to be testing out the new storybook cosmetics rose brush set I mean look before we even dive into everything we just got a look at this damn thing because they are so amazing storybook cosmetics is an indie brand that I discovered on Instagram and I reviewed their eyeshadow palette like a month or two ago it was the wizardry and witchcraft palette which looked like this and this was Jeffrey star approved I love the formula and I don't know I'm just really into the shadows themselves and of course the packaging is done named so besides testing out the Rose brush set in today's video I also have a giveaway that I am doing now this was just done on my own and I bought the stuff with my own money I did not team up with the brand but if you want to enter the giveaway you will be winning this eyeshadow palette so this one is brand new obviously besides the eyeshadow palette I am also giving a way the entire brush set that I am reviewing today if not the used one of course so everything will be brand new and all you have to do to enter the giveaway is leave a comment down below you can say hi you can comment on the video you can give me an emoji whatever you want to do but leaving a comment down below will enter you and you have to be subscribed to my channel but besides that you guys let's dive into the expression alright you guys so when you get the rose brush set it comes in as a beautiful a storybook cosmetic pouch I love it and look at the little bow you guys I think all the little details that they do is really cool the boat obviously is for pulling the zipper and then it has a little charm on it on the back that is a William Shakespeare quote it says what's in a name that which we call the rose by any other name would smell sweet girl that's cute for $55 that's what this retails for you get the little pouch and then you get for bone of the brushes now listen from a packaging whore like myself who is so into this type of stuff I was obsessed when I saw this on Instagram I mean just look at them the detailing you get a little logo right here and you still have you guys I know I always talk about weight and stuff and it's always a fucking like you know how I feel about a heavy products please feel nice now I do want to talk about what it says on the website about these guys the official name also quit for this brush that you guys is called the what's in a name rose brushes trademark work and basically you guys for fifty five dollars you get these four beautiful brushes it says that's the stunning scarlet ombre cruelty free synthetic bristles have a gorgeous green rose stem that is made out of metal alloy so it's sturdy you guys these feel good alright so in this set you guys you get a tapered highlighting brush which I'm going to assume is this one now when they say highlighting they could mean like a metallic cheek glow or they could mean like putting you know setting powder or powders over your concealer so we're definitely going to test out with that you also get a angled contour and blush brush and that looks something like this guy that is the angled one and then you get a flat top powder brush and a dome top powder brush which here is the flat top and then here is the dome top powder brush now I do go to say I know you can't feel these through the screen they feel really good bitch these feel good so it does say that these brushes can be used with creams and liquids however the bristle density so like how thick the bristles are in here is more suitable for powder formulas the brushes can be washed and the bristles will maintain their beautiful scarlet color well I like how they said that because a lot of times you guys you'll buy something you'll wash it and then like the color kind of like comes off and you're like but allegedly these do not do that of course I've never used them and I have not cleaned them yet so we'll have to see about that at a later date but you guys basically I am going to try out all four brushes I do have to put on primer and foundation with another brush because there is not a foundation brush in this set but we will test out loose powder foundation powder contour and highlight so if you want to see me get down on this face then keep on watching alright you guys for primer I know I've used so many primers on this channel I've actually been using this off-camera for a few times and I really love it it's from a brand called touch in soul that I found on Sephora this brand is kind of indie and basically this is a smooth and pore covering primer it is kind of like tacky and almost like not play believe it has like that weird human reminds me of the Urban Decay optical illusion primer oh my god its connect the same color that's kind of weird so I'm going to take a little dollop like that and let's put this all over my face now it doesn't leave your skin like really tacky tacky but it just feels very like smooth I mean that is a really good word to describe it smooth is fuck girl all right for foundation today I'm going to be going in with the Dior forever foundation now Jacqueline Hill recommended this foundation and I'm like girl if you love it I got to try this out so basically this is like a pore refining perfect makeup everlasting wear with sunscreen type of foundation and I really love it I'm just gonna be real I didn't even sell my first impressions because it's been out for a while and I'm like growing no I'm going to watch that and maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm right I don't know but I figure let me just turn off camera and then I'll try it in the video if it even works girl it works now usually I apply it with a Beauty Blender but because we're doing two brush video I thought maybe I'll try to do a brush now not a lot of you're going to be like what a hell is going on so I'm going to try this look at Sephora dome like a little pro brush and I'm going to do the foundation first and then we're going to test out the rose brushes of course we got to do one more step which is apply concealer before we try all the brushes with the powder so I'm going to be going in with the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD and we're just going to you see a Beauty Blender in my hand y'all I'm just going to bounce this out really quickly oh my god uses a lot bitch where is it it was like Rob Kardashian's Instagram Hank there anymore there we go [Music] all right the concealer is blended out now let's try the brushes okay so the first brush for you guys it says the well we can do them in every order we want I really want to do the powder brushes first because I am going to do a little bit of baking and some foundation powder all over this face so what the website says that there is a dome top powder brush and a flat top powder brush so of course this will be the flat one which to me looks like you could like pack on powder with it and then of course we have the dome top powder brush so I think you guys I'm just going to first of all take some loose powder so I'm going to go in with my favorite lemare the powder now I would normally use this one for the flattop one I'm down to put in like powder foundation but for this we're going to set our concealer everywhere where I put the concealer so let's oh my god I barely dip that any girl the product adheres to the bristles thank you Jesus dust that off and I'm going to press this under my eye oh wow all the product is like literally in my skin that was really easy I'm like learning magic tricks going on here let me look let me look closer wow yeah this side is like yeah it's normal but this side is like extra snatch wow you guys durable of course we are going to hit the chin come on chin and then the little smile lines a little bit on the nose and then the forehead alright now we're going to try a V Rose a flat top a powder brush now this looks really dense it feels good so I'm just going to go in what I'd normally would do lately I've been loving the Chanel is just the double perfection lumineer foundation powder I'm going to hit pan on this soon so we're going to go in with this and we are going to of course the brush is clean we're going to pack some powder on that welcome bristles we are coated now what I'm going to do like I normally do is take this and we're going to press and pack this all into the skin I think the only thing that I would say about this one already is I wish it was maybe a little bigger just because packing it on you see you already need to dip it again so you have to kind of go in smaller sections and if you would have had like a bigger brush but to me that's really not the end of the world because hey if you're said now I'm doing your makeup unless you're in a brush you're good girl that should have given me full coverage of vibes and I am living for it it really packed it into the skin and I am a fan already okay cool and now let's try to contour okay only in the Geoffrey video will I review one blog menu 16 other ones I was just feeling a little corpse like so I need some lipstick and before everyone's that girl what the fuck is that this is the new skin tight lip mo hmm now we are going to try out the contour brush so it looks like something like this it is angled I love that so I'm going to assume we're just going to go and what are we going to use today the first thing that I'm noticing is I have this little I love this one this is the Maybelline master contour you've seen me use this plenty of times and I'm just going to go in and let's just see how this works first of all great it picks up the pigment I love that about these brushes okay so I'm just going to start here and kind of follow my natural razor-sharp cheekbone and Wow and then we're just gonna with no other product it's going to kind of blend up and see if the product wants to move it applied it really like I don't want to say natural but kind of natural when you guys know I go hard on the contour and this is like I don't even know why I'm still blending it really doesn't need it I know a lot of you're probably wondering like how does it feel to hold the brush like I am reviewing brushes I know I don't do that often on my channel but I do want to note that these are easy you know when I saw them online I was a little weary I was a little scared like okay it's a stem how hard is it going to be a whole compared to like a normal contour brush just like thick it's really not like I don't really notice a difference it's almost like you have like a ballpoint pen and this isn't too heavy what you're like oh my god it's like a dead weight it feels really good like it's expensive feeling but not like oh my god I'm gonna like get carpal tunnel tomorrow type of healing you guys know about the cut this jaw line up and it's blending really really nice I'm just taking some more product and just kind of tucking it under the chin ja now the only thing that you really can't do with that brush is contort your nose so we can skip it or I mean honestly you could use the tip of this if you're like hey girl this is all we got you can put product there and probably just kind of you know flick down oh yeah that distributed product is it going to be the best not like nose contour of your life probably not but hey it's working alright you guys this space is contoured now it says you can also apply the lush with this brush so I'm just going to use my hand and dust it off and let's try some blush I guess boom alright you guys for blush today we're going to go in with my one of my all-time favorite it is from Marc Jacobs Beauty it is called lines and last night and we are just going to go in with the same brush now that's a little clean and we'll just oh girl yeah these brushes hold the pigment let's just apply a little bit to the apples of our cheeks and see what happens I love how soft it applies it it's like not too extreme it's not like oh shit she has blush on it is really soft alright the blush applied really nicely I'm loving how it looks and now it says it's like a tapered highlighting brush this is the only thing I really haven't used yet now highlighting I'm going to assume it's like a lot of the primes you guys know I'll take highlighting powder meaning to highlight your under eyes not metal or metallic looking highlighters you can take this bam bam and press the under the eye you can definitely do that but I mean I'm down to apply some highlight for the metal glow today we're going to be going in with one of my favorites this is from the leaked makeup this is the Solstice highlighting palette let's open her up and I'm going to be using these two powders today that's actually a cream we're just going to go in with this little guy and here we'll just mix and match okay so I'm just going to take this and merge it into the contour and now this is a really really bright highlight so of course if you don't want this look you can go in with something softer now it was a little worried that this is going to be too thick on top and kind of make it go everywhere but it really put it exactly where I wanted it I'm just going to take a little bit of the highlighting powder maybe do my chin in this little hair very subtly of course you guys see I just hit my nose to an extreme level besides that you guys we have tested out all four brushes so let me give y'all my final thoughts so after testing these bad bitches out I will say this I'm a fan they all worked I was like okay maybe one's going to do the job or like I didn't know how they were going to feel they feel expensive I love the design the design is a plus for me I'm sure you guys are like yes girl they are very cute I love how soft the bristles feel a lot of the times with synthetic or vegan brushes they can feel a little plastic a a little cheap but obviously companies are finding a way to make them feel way more luxurious because girl these are really really nice so let's go in order let's see here we have the powder brush this one was amazing it applied everything really great very soft now the flat top powder brush it packed in the powder amazing of course I did say something about the size I do wish it was maybe a little bigger to distribute the powder more quick lean but hey it did the job so I cannot hate on that now the angle the contour and blush brush I loved it this one maybe my favorite from all for the way it applied the contour was so quick and easy and I just loved how it just blended out soft then of course we just did the highlighting tapered brush which definitely worked I wouldn't normally apply my highlight with this big of a brush looking in the monitor it definitely went a little over the contour I would probably keep the highlight probably a little bit up there but the course is a bigger brush and hey it may be for highlighting with powders under the eye I didn't ask the company but I will find out eventually alright so I'm just going to say it right here via storybook cosmetics rose brushes are Jeffrey Sarah I really like them you guys I think for $55 is a price point good I know a lot of you're going to be questioning the price look the brushes are very well made they're very unique I'm

What’s up everybody?
Welcome back to my channel. Today I am not applying makeup,
I know that might sound a little shocking. But, we’re going to dive into the infamous
topic of antiaging and skincare. Now this is not a full regime
of how I do my skincare. I know you guys have been asking
about that for a long time. I promise I will do it this summer. I want
to talk about antiaging, extreme antiaging and what I do personally to look
this way and it’s crazy, because to me and a lot of people say this when
they haven’t seen me in a while or a few years. They’re like, “Bitch, are you like
rewinding the age clock? How do you look like that?” How do you have no wrinkles
under your eyes? No bags” It’s not easy, I will say that.
I will say that right now. Of course we’re gonna go into
a little in-depth whole thing. I’m also gonna be applying
some masks. I’m gonna be talking about my favorite
moisturizers, favorite lipscrubs. Creams for the hands, neck, face. Everything bitch, I got a cream for everything. Quick disclaimer. Everything in today’s
video works for me, of course trying out these things throughout
the years is how I discovered a lot of this stuff. And I’m also gonna be talking about some tips
and tricks that I do on the daily that of course free. Just everyday life for when you’re in
the car, when you’re out in the sun. All the crazy shit that
I do to look like this. I just want to put it out there you guys,
that I just turned thirty years old. What’s up three zero,
how are you? So what does thirty mean? It means that it’s really time to amp up
the antiaging, if you don’t want to age. Now there are a lot of people that are gonna say
“But aging gracefully is amazing and I like wrinkles.” Sorry, that was hard to come out my mouth. Now I do wanna say one thing, because I always
make jokes about plastic surgery and fillers. Now I think that a lot of YouTube “beauty
gurus” go way overboard with their fillers and that’s obviously their insecurities
and they have a lot going on right here. But if you want to do something for yourself
because you want to change you and there’s no other factors, there’s no one else telling
you what to do and you want to do it for yourself, I think that is the only time that you
should do anything and modify yourself. If you wanna get your breasts done,
if you wanna get bigger lips, if you wanna get Botox and you
wanna do it for you, bitch go do it. And if it makes you feel better inside or just
because you wanna change something for fun, I think that’s what is most important. Now I am gonna say this, of course you guys
have seen me get lip injections on my channel, but I do not have Botox and a lot of people probably
make jokes cause I make jokes and I’m very sarcastic. You guys know that. But if you guys didn’t know,
I’m a very sarcastic person and throughout the years I have made jokes about
getting facial surgery, crazy shit done to me and a lot of it was just me being
funny and none of it was true. So, I’ve had my lips done. Do I have Botox? Do I have filler or anything else on my face? No! That is the final answer. I don't know. Maybe people don’t believe me
because I’ve said shit in the past, I don’t know. But, I can move my forehead,
I can move any part of my face. I mean, there’s no Botox in this face
or I’d be a little bit more frozen. I think the problem with today’s society
and anti-aging in the market for, is that a lot of the times it’s geared
for old woman or older people. The problem with that you guys,
I’m not saying it’s too late. But if you’re going to show a sixty-year-old
an eye cream, it’s already too late. They are... they’ve already
aged around their eyes. If you have crow’s feet already
and it’s really severe, you know? It’s not that it’s too too late,
but you should of done it before. So, I think a lot of the time all these
myths and secrets and tricks, a lot of it is really just a lie and you know,
companies are trying to sell you the dream. At the end of the day it’s all about genetics
and also your diet is very important. I drink water all day long. It may seem like
I’m drinking Red Bull on Snapchat all the time, but I am drinking water all day long. And your diet is very important
to aging as well. For all of you people that are
addicted to caffeine and soda, that just dries out your skin and
over time you will look a lot older. As we like to say. But, you wanna see what
the fuck I’m talking about? And all these crazy tricks
I’ve got up my sleeves? Then keep on watching. I at age, I’m trying to think here. Girl I’m trying to rewind
the fucking clock. One, two, three. Okay, probably
at around age fifteen. So 15 years ago, I trained
myself to not move my face. So what does that mean? It means that you see my forehead. I mean for my age,
my forehead is very smooth. There are a little few fine lines in there,
which is obviously normal. But I have done a really good job of when
I’m talking or laughing or really expressing. I don’t really move my face and I don’t
mean when I’m talking I’m just like. I move my face, but I don’t really move this area
a lot and I don’t really move like my forehead. So I don’t really move
my face when I laugh. I don’t move my eyes. Now we’re about to dive into some skincare and
I’m gonna show you guys my favorite products. I’m gonna test out and show you guys a new
mask that just hit the market a month ago. Now when I’m washing or cleansing, you need to
find products that have no alcohol in them, okay? Alcohol and anything is the devil,
it will age you. Now some of the things have to have a tiny bit
of alcohol for formulas and I understand that. I definitely look past that sometimes. But toners that have severe alcohol in it, you’re
just literally wiping the future off of your face. So one of my favorite primers
ever is by the brand Sisley. It is the floral toning lotion and I’ve mentioned
this in a previous favorites video. This is my third bottle, it is amazing. Now I love to use little cotton circles,
you can get these at the drugstore. Now everything in todays video you guys, is sadly
not drugstore or price friendly and antiaging stuff, you really can’t find something that is
gonna really stop time at Wholegreens. But you can get these cotton pads and I’m not trying
to be shady but that’s just really, really realistic. I have tried out so many products and the drugstore isn’t the antiaging kingdom
of where you gonna find these secrets. So this toner, it’s a little more
pricey but it is amazing. It’s good for dry and sensitive
skin out there. People ask me all the time,
“What kind of skin do you have? Do you have dry? Do you have normal?
Do you have combination? Do you have oily?” I really fall in that middle category
of just normal skin. In the morning you guys, I love to wake up
and before even brushing my teeth... I mean the teeth are really important bitch,
but the skin is really what I focus on first. So I’ll take a little cotton pad and I will put some
all in here and then I just wipe down my skin and this will remove all of the dirt and the oil that
your skin was dealing with throughout the night. I will wipe down my entire face
and I love wiping down my neck. The neck and this area
is very important. Now let me show you something
a little disgusting. You see that? That was on my face. This is all of the dirt and
oil from last night. So once the dirt is off of your skin,
then we can move on. And before we move on, I just wanna say
a few more brands that I’m loving right now. Now Lamer, you guys know is
a very expensive skincare brand. They have amazing makeup now. But this is another toner,
it’s called La Tonic. It’s amazing for just kind of like a refresher throughout
the day and it doesn’t leave you shiny or weird. Which some toners can leave
you feeling sort of... I don’t know. Every product does something different. And then recently the brand Fresh, who I discovered in
Sephora like two years ago and now I am such a fan. Just put out the Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner
and yes, those are rose particals in the bottle. I’m kind of living for it. It looks so cool. And I don’t have it in front of me, but I used to use
a Dover toner from the drugstore actually and it is alcohol free. So remember guys, when you are buying stuff
at the drugstore or at the mall or anywhere, look at the back of the bottle or the
box and look at the ingredients. It might be in the middle, it might be
at the front, it might be at the bottom. But if the word alcohol is in there
and it’s a toner, run for the hills. So after I tone my skin
I love to moisturize. Now it’s gonna be a little probably
weird to explain this because I use different moisturizers
throughout the week. So I don’t stick to one
every day, you know? Sometimes I’ll feel a little more
dry, sometimes I’m travelling. Like a few of my favorites I’m obsessed
with, I have to say this LaMer one again. I know I have mentioned this in favorites videos,
but this is the moisturizing soft cream and I just ran out of my huge bottle. It lasted me like eleven months
which is pretty damn good. I know the price point is a little extreme and
a lot of you are gonna be like, “Girl. spare me”. But I think after using it for a few years, I’ve seen
a difference and I love how it makes me feel. Another one I’m obsessed with is this Dior Totale
Capture moisturizer and I love bringing this on trips. Now another really great one that I recommend
to people is from the brand Fresh. Again, this is the Ultimate Aging
Complexion Treatment. It is a soft cream, meaning it is a moisturizer. Now it’s a little weird because when
you open it, it feels almost air light. Almost like flubber, it’s not...
it’s just weird. So I will just take this and just kind
of rub it in between my fingers and then we’re just gonna
massage all over the skin. And I love just going all over the
face like a mini little massage. Also, you know what’s crazy
is perfume, right? This is just a quick side note. When you are spraying perfume on yourself,
that is literal pure alcohol with fragrance. It’s really like alcohol mixed with alcohol. And we’re not talking about the drinking kind,
we’re talking about real alcohol the ingredient. And imagine every morning,
what are you doing? You’re literally spraying alcohol
on your skin every single day. So when I do perfume I only really spray on my
clothes or I’ll dab a little bit and I’ll barely rub it, but it’s like every time I do it I’m like clinging
because we’re aging honey, we’re aging. So, I’m bringing the extraness as always. So the brand Sicily a few months ago came
out with something that is for the neck only. This is the neck cream. It’s supposed to firm, refine,
remodel your existence. Now this is supposed to show
improvement after a month. Now I’ve used this for a while.
I’m not gonna say my neck looks better. Does it feel softer and has
the skin kind of improved? 100% we’ll say it has. It smells so good. So, the neck cream looks
something like this. It smells so fresh and I love Sicily. I know you guys heard me use this
so many times on my channel. One of their favorite products of mine is their
primer which a lot of Youtubers are using now. This one though, the neck cream works. So we’re just gonna take
some out on our nail. We’re just gonna dot it all over our neck
and this just feels so fresh and amazing. Alright, now let’s talk about when you’re gonna go
out into the world, you’re gonna leave your house and you’re gonna say hello to this sun,
which is aka the devil. And what are we going
to do about that? Now I am someone that is... We keep saying the word extreme,
that’s me. Now when I go outside you guys, I don’t ever sit in the sun longer
than five minutes. When I’m walking to my car,
I will hold something up, I’m literally... this is not what
I hold up normally, but I hold up things so the sun
never touches my face. When I am walking around
at lets say a music festival or an outdoor mall or I’m walking somewhere
far, I always bring like an umbrella. I don’t give a fuck how dumb I look
or what people say about me. Also, sunscreen is very
important you guys. Now you don’t have to get
a boogey ass sunscreen, of course the drugstore has some
great ones from Neutrogena. But I love a sunscreen with SPF 50. Now here’s a disclaimer that I’m just
gonna say and put it out there. A lot of brands, even in the drugstore or the mall will give a disclaimer
of yes 150 SPF da da da. That is a false advertisement and
those products do not exist. Any brand is allowed to put whatever
number they want on here and lie. I don’t know why that’s allowed legally. But if you’ve seen stuff that’s
like 110 SPF it’s not real. It can only go up to 50. Besides that I always
put on sunscreen before my makeup definitely in the summer
 especially out here, I always wear sun glasses. I know I have mentioned
this in previous videos and people probably roll their eyes. Buut girl, I just got to say one thing sun glasses
are probably one of the biggest keys of anti-aging for me personally that
I have noticed throughout the years. I always look over at people
they’re squinting, their eyes are fucked,
they looking crazy, the sun is beaming on their face
in traffic and they just like “Uhh” I’m not gonna do it cause
my eyes will pull. But you know what I mean when someone’s
squinting and it’s just like... crows feet’s to the gods
and I’m like no. So every time I leave the house I don’t
care if I have full make up on or not, I am using this as an extreme example
but I love sun glasses. Now, these glasses are very
obnoxious and big, which I love anything big in my hands,
mouth or face. I love these because
they are massive. You know you don’t have to get
designer sun glasses, there are a million sun glasses out
there in the world just get some that are UV protectived and don’t get played
by some false ass advertisement. Now I know we talked
about diet earlier, but I think it is very important
to know that I don’t party and what I mean about partying is you guys,
I don’t drink alcohol, I don’t get wasted. And a lot of you know this about me,
but if you are a new... Hi. I have never tried alcohol before I know that
is going to seem shocking to some people. I just think that people go and
dig up old videos on my channel when I was touring and doing music
and a lot of them were like “Oh my god we found a picture
of you  with a shot glass” And I’m like girl, that was full of Fiji
water and it was for the shot. You know for the camera,
it’s for the moment I pretended to take
a shot with my friends. There is also a footage
of me with a drink. You know when I go to a bar
and you ask for a Red Bull or a Shirley Temple which
by the way is Sprite and grenadine for everyone
out there that is like “What the hell is that?” I will hold a drink and it will look like
all my friends but its Red Bull. So please do not try to clock me. Not drinking is something
that I am proud of and I think at my age there
is really no point to start. My family comes from
a long line of addicts and I know there is some of you
out there that can relate to that. Anyone that has a crazy cousin or a brother
or a sister or parents who are alcoholics or you know addicts definitely
can relate to me on that one. Where you know me personally I don’t
want to follow down those footsteps of my family and go down that path,
so I chose to not drink at a really young age. I’ve stuck to it...
I don’t see a point in it now. Do I love smoking weed every day? yes that is relaxing and calming it
takes away my anxiety and I just feel over
all great after I hit. Also a quick note. I have never tried cigarettes. I have never puffed on one. Of course I’ve done one for
pictures in the past. But I’ve never smoked and I think
nicotine and cigarettes are so awful. And I know a lot of you are gonna
try come at me for smoking weed, it is such a big difference. Just go on Google and type what is the difference
between cannabis and cigarettes? And you will get a long list of what
the hell is going on bitches. So besides that you guys,
I love facemasks. And of course you guys have seen me use
the Mud from Glamglow over and over. It is one of my favorite products of all time
and another thing that I love for moisturizing, I know you guys have seen
me all over my Snapchat using the Sicily black
rose cream mask. Also they have something called
the eye contour mask. Yeah this is crazy, you can almost
feel it like pulsing on your skin. Also I just wanna quickly
shout out Keels for their midnight recovery
eye treatment. I love this. So I think I wanna end this video
by using a new mask I discovered a month ago and I’ve
been trying it out for a few weeks to make sure it worked before
I dare talk about it. Cause I aint about to tell
you about no bullshit. So the brand Charlotte Tilbury, which makes one of my favorite
nude lipsticks of all time. So this is called the Instant
Magic Facial Dry Sheet Mask. And basically this is supposed
to hydrate, lift wrinkles, sooth and brighten your skin tone. It comes like this,
you open it up bam. So we’ll take one out, it’s a classic
rose gold packaging which I live for. Now it’s a little weird you guys,
because it is literally like dry. And there she is. Wow! So I’m just gonna read you
guys the instructions. Now unfold your dry sheet mask, place pink side onto cleanse skin,
we’re cleanse honey. And it wants me to hook the top hooks
over my ears, oh my god! Another airone. Fuck, where’s Manny
when I need him? Loop bottom hooks over
the ears ensuring the mask is smoothed over every facial contour. Gently massage on top to activate,
leave on for fifteen minutes to activate. So the cool thing about it you guys, is once it’s on you rub it and it actually
starts to do something, which is crazy. So I’m just gonna put
this on me right now. Look at that nose honey, yes. Alright so the mask is on the face. It looks a little weird cause it does fold,
but it does seamlessly go, the nose is on. So it basically says that it wants
me to gently massage. Now I’ve been... this is my
fourth mask I’ve done and I really just go like this back
and forth and I just massage it. And this is just basically activating
whatever ingredients that are in here and it is starting
to soak into the skin. I know you can’t see much and it looks
a little funky, but I promise it’s working. So I’m going to massage this
for another 30 seconds and I will be back in 15 minutes. And fifteen minutes later we’re back. I’m gonna take this mask off. Mask off, fucking mask off, mask off,
motherfucking set hey. Right and my hair is crazy. Alright, now that the mask is off,
the skin... oh my god! I don’t know what is in here
when you grab it, it is so crazy I’m like
where’s the ingredients? Shea butter, glycerin, fruit oil, seed butter,
vegetable oil, soy bean oil... oh my god. Okay, well my skin... every time I use these I’m like,
you know when you do a mask and you can’t stop feeling your skin
'cause it feels baby soft? That’s what’s happening right now. But besides that you guys, I hope you learned
something new in today’s video. If you think I’m ridiculous for wanting
to age, great keep on scrolling. But I hope you guys learned something and just be careful out there
with the sun and your diet. And just remember at the end
of the day I love this type of stuff and this is what I’m into it. I’ve been a makeup artist for 15 years
now and I’m all into skincare and I think that’s very important. If you’re someone that
doesn’t give a fuck and you just watch this for entertainment,
thank you so much for watching. And I will see you guys
on the next video. Bye guys. 
What's up everybody? Welcome back to my channel. Today... this is highly requested. A little bit. So today's video, I'm finally doing the tag
that has been sent to me, tweeted to me, snapped to me, over and over. The “I do my
 boyfriends brother's make-up challenge.” So hi, this is Zach. What's up everybody? Aka young Zachery, so of course you guys
 know by now this is Nate's younger brother. -How old are you?
- I am 21. Just turned 21. What's your sign? Capricorn. So after I did Nate's make-up,
everybody was like, “Okay, who's next?” So I know it's been a long time coming, thank you guys
for being so patient, but I'm finally in town long enough  to finally do this challenge. So I'm sure they're
going to ask a lot of questions at home, like they... okay y'all, this hair is playing me.
I'm taking this clip. A lot of people want to know have you
ever tried make-up for a Halloween costume? Have you ever put on make-up in general for fun,
to be funny, or like ever in your entire life? Actually, this is going to be my first time
ever getting a full face make-up. I'm lucky enough to have Jeffree do it himself. Yes. Okay, so this is a little bit of a challenge because
if you guys are at home and you already know, if someone has never put on make-up
before, can their face handle it? Are their eyes going to get crazy?
What's gonna happen? But I guess that's the whole fun of it. So have you ever worn contact lenses?
-No. Fuck me. Fuck my life. Okay, so the eyes might
be a little tricky, but I mean... that's gonna be the fun part. So I have a lot of new make-up, a lot of old
favorites that I'm gonna use today on Zach and I think we're just gonna dive right
into it and let’s see what the hell happens. Yeah, let's go. So if you want to see me transform
Zach, then keep on watching. So before we start anything and before we prime
of course, we're going to ask my make-up client, what kind of skin do you think you have? I think it's fairly normal, to be honest.
-It is pretty normal? -Yeah.
Up close, it's not oily like at all and it's not dry, there's no dry patches so usually what I do on
people, you guys is I usually feel around the face. His skin honestly feels like mine, which is very
normal and flawless and fabulous. I know they're going to read me down. OK, so today for primer I have something really
exciting and new that we're going to use today. This is from Farsali, you may know
them from all over Instagram and they just launched in Sephora
and shit it just looks pretty. So, they just launched this product called
Unicorn Tears aka Unicorn essence and what this is like a serum skin-enhancing like
primer so, we're going to give it a whirl. Okay so we're just going to do a little here,
oh just got some on the jacket, great I always do this, you can't
see it though. Oh you can see it! When you get primer on someone’s clothes,
just apologize and keep it moving. And I always like to do make-up on the neck.
Now, we're going to take a little Gucci foundation brush and I'm just going to blend this all
into his skin and get it snatched. So prior to ever moving to California,
did you take care of your skin at all? What was your skin care regimen?
-I mean, really just basic stuff like, Soap and water?
-Yeah. Just showering. That's it?
-Normally. Lord Jesus. We've been kind of working on your skin.
-Okay. All right, now it's time for some foundation. So this basically is going to make
your skin look fucking flawless.  It's Zach so we're going to use the Skin Caviar
foundation with SPF 15 by La Prairie. This is so amazing and I reviewed this on
my channel like a year ago almost, oh my god, and it's one of my favorite foundations,
it's like amazing. Ooh, actually you guys, I'm going to mix because
I mix on myself, so this is basically like I'm going to do how I would do my own make-up, on him and I love mixing…
this is a spray, so close your eyes. Time to get that mannequin skin.
He's like what the fuck is going on. We're going to blend that out in a second.
Now we're going to put this all over you. Alright, now we're going to take a damp beauty
blender and we're going to buff this into the skin. Alright, the foundation is looking laid. Look in the monitor,
your skins like mannequin, crazy, right? Now, for concealer we're going to go in with
one of my favorites, the Tarte shape tape and we're about to brighten.
Now, Zach doesn't really need concealer, he has like a little discoloration under
the eyes but definitely normal. So for everyone out there that doesn't know,
where are you from? Michigan. Grand rapids, Michigan. Yeah Grand rapids.
-I personally love it out there, shout out to everyone in Michigan.
Ooh, look at that eye, everybody! It's already a little watery, your eyes are like,
“We've never had this shit close.” We're going to set the under eyes
before they start creasing. We're going to use the La Mer, The Powder,
this is... it's fucking the best shit on earth really. So you see, so this is what men do,
they move their forehead a lot and you girls already know
you gotta fix that creasing. Alright, so today we're going to contour to filth and
we're going to use our little Lorac Pro contour book. Bam. I think I'm going to go in
with the medium color for him and I'm just going to use
this little Morphe 527 brush. So now we're going to, so your genes, your family
have such strong jaws, you really don't need contour, like your jaw could literally cut somebody in half,
but we're just going to really chisel that out today. So when you were growing up, did people ever say
you and Nate looked a lot alike or not until recently? Oh yeah, no we've got it out whole lives.
-Okay. People always asking if we're twins or not. Yeah. In the Botox video with Nate, so many
people thought you guys were twins,  I mean you guys look similar. The brows, the jaw,
the cheekbones, but I don't think you guys look like twins. Yeah, I don't know. So many people were like, “Did Nate have
blonde hair and then pink?” And I'm like “I don't think they're that similar”. Alright so, did you know when you contour
the nose you can make it look smaller, longer? Now I'm using a make-up brush
that had no product on it, this is just a little Mac 224 blending,
one of my favorites.  I'm actually going to switch my idea and
use this Make-up Forever fan brush, it's like really quick and easy, all you have to do is like
go down the nose, like really one, two, three, bam. And to diffuse it, you guys know I like
to go back and forth with powders, and we're just going to hit this beige color,
and then we're just going to go right over that so the lines are not as severe but if you want
a severe contour, go ahead girl, do you. I think we're going to do the brows quickly,
and then we're going to do a little highlight. What do you normally do on yourself,
just kind of tweeze sometimes? Yeah, just tweeze, keep them upkeep. You and Nate have like prime eyebrows,
they're very like, they have an arch already. Some people have caterpillars, but yours have like,
“I'll kill you and your whole family” vibe. So we're going to use the Anastasia
Beverly Hills Brow Definer. Now he does have really light hair,
but dark brows so I'm going to do a shade that is not black or granite,
this is chocolate. Now, you guys see… look in the camera
a little bit, he does have a little bit of sparseness here. Is that just how your eyebrows have always been?
-Yeah. You didn't like hit yourself ever or?
-No, no scars. No scar?
-That's just how it grew. Okay cool. Let's fill this in. Alright, so now that the brows are done,
I'm just going to make sure that all the foundation, powder and everything is just flawless,
so we're going to have you close your eyes and do a little Mac Fix plus, my tried and true.
Feels good, right? Feels amazing.
-Refreshing? Now we're just going to add a tiny
bit of color to Zach's cheeks, so we're going to go in with…
this is a new one this is called Bumpy Ride. Okay so we're going to highlight, I'm getting
the giggles, we're going to go in with a little Peach Goddess from this brand
I've never heard of before. Do a little glow. Shine. Yeah, the extreme shine. Okay on a personal level, do you like girls that wear
a lot of make-up or do you like the natural look? I'm going to say I am kind of
into the natural look. I don't mind if you like to get
dressed up and like get the make-up on to feel nice and pretty
every now and then but normally I'd like just… Little more natural?
-More natural, yeah. So a lot of people are tweeting me
and asking me a lot of questions so this is going to be like a Barbara Walters
interview right now. You ready for it? Let's go.
-Okay. So number one most requested question is, Is Zach single?
-I am single. Zach is single, so for everyone that
can't have Nate out there, DM Zach. Just kidding, but okay that's cool.
Are you loving California? I really am. There's just so many different types
of people out here, everybody's different, The culture is crazy, huh?
-Yeah. There's a million different cultures
out here which I think is pretty cool. It's very eclectic. Obviously we have bomb weather. Oh yeah, so glad to get out of the Winter. Did you love the snow storms and hitting ice
off your windows in the morning or what? No. The only thing I liked about Winter is snowboarding,
but other than that I can do without. With that, you can just go up two hours north,
we have snow in Big Bear which is one of my favorite spots.
You haven't gone there yet? Not yet.
-We're going to take you. So, we're going to dip into the Anastasia Beverly Hills
Nicole Guerrero Highlighting palette, voila. And we're going to dip into shade Kitty Kat
which is my favorite shade from this palette. I think I will hit pan very soon. Devil highlight
just gives your face an extra like holy shit. So we are highlighted, everything looks amazing.
Now we're going to… oh my god, now we're going to say a silent prayer together,
we're going to try to do some sort of eye shadow. Of course, we have to use
the new Androgyny palette. Now of course you can create so many
endless smoky eyes with this, so I don't know if we're going to get a full smoky eye
out of Zach's soul today or if we're going to try, so we're going to go in with the trusty
Paint Pot Pink Julie from Mac. This basically makes your eyeshadow
stay on all day without creasing. For everyone out there that doesn't know,
Zach works at my warehouse, so if you bought a lipstick, Zach's probably packed it
or helped pack it. But what else are you into? I don't know, I'm really trying to get
into the groove of things still.  I'm not a huge like, going out person,
going to bars, I'm not a huge drinker. More of like a relaxed,
-We all like to stay chill. Yeah. Which I think might shock people. I think a lot
of people might think we're like partiers or we go out all the time but we're really
like into watching movies all the time, they play a lot of video games.
-Little bit. What's your favorite game? You guys play
so many games, you guys, I don't even know. Yeah I don't have like a strict favorite,
I mean old school, Kingdom Hearts. Number one. All the time.
-See, I don't know what that is.  I'm all Nintendo 64 for me. Donkey Kong.
-Yeah, Super Mario. Super Nintendo was my shit back in the day.
Street Fighter, Mortal Combat. You don't want to fuck
with me on Mortal Combat. I'll come for you. Zach also really loves music.
-Music festivals. They're the best. This Summer in June I'm actually
going to be going to Electric Forest, it's actually going to be my second year, and I am… So that's like a huge festival right? So for anyone…
I don't really know what that is, I just kind of learned about it,
so it's like a huge outdoor, right? OK, and what do you do,
just a bunch of different stages? Yep, show up, put up your tent.
There's fields of tents then you actually get to walk all the way
to the gates to get to the venues. Oh so you camp outside of the thing?
-Mhm. Oh, oh my god. I might… oh, I can't go. I'm doing Vidcon this year everybody if you didn't know.
That's just a quick announcement. I will be doing panels and guest speaking
at Vidcon in Anaheim California, or I would be going with you because
that sounds really bomb. I know y'all don't think I can be in a tent in the wilderness,
but I have camped before. It's fun. It's a cool experience and you get to meet a lot of new people.
-Yeah. So we're going to dip into shade
Charm and let's see what happens. Okay, look down, this is probably going to be easy
because I don't think your eyes are going to water looking down, you never know. So yeah,
just chill right there and let’s see what happens. If you guys didn't know, you can of course
use any powder for eye shadows, I love using contours sometimes for crease, but I'm just going to use this light
highlighting shade to diffuse. Alright now you guys, we are going to deepen the crease a little bit. Now look down, see his eyes you guys, they're not
like as sunken in as mine or as deep set, but they are a little deep set, those will come out,
it's almost like it's a little tricky. So with this, we're going to take
this tiny little Cozzette brush. And we're going to dip into shade
Dominatrix really lightly. Okay. So we are just going to blend this in. It's coming together, so we're just going to
go back into Charm and just soften that. Alright, now we are going to add some of this
glitter that's on my lid, it just looks pretty baller. This is the rose gold retro magnificent
metals glitter and glow liquid eye shadow. This is from Stila and I'm obsessed
with these, I think the whole internet is. If you've not tried them out yet, I am obsessed.
I can't stop wearing them. Now, I'm just going to apply this
with the wand, fuck it, right? Woohoo, lean back.
Looks cool, it's like blinding. Okay so a lot of people… this is like the main
 event question which I think is so annoying, but people want to know what's your sexuality.
Are you straight, are you... what are you? To be honest, I'm not really into
the whole like genderfying people’s feelings and emotions.
I don't really think that's huge. Right. Everyone always wants a label which is so annoying.
-Yeah. Because you know me and Nate
deal with that all the time. I do definitely all the time and
I feel like people just crave labels. Well I'm attracted to women, but I feel
like anything can really happen, emotions and feelings can
happen between everybody. Definitely.
-Down the road, who am I to say what I'm going to like down the road Right, you can't predict life really.
-Exactly. I think your brothers a good example. So I think a lot of people also were asking like,
what did Zach think when Nate first said, “Hey, I'm dating Jeffree.” How did that first come
about if you don't mind me asking? Look down too. At first I didn't actually know
anything about you. I wasn't really into the whole Myspace
thing so I wasn't there for that. I was a little shocked just because
he's been with women… His entire life.
-Exactly. So I was… Which some people don't believe when
I'm like Nate's only dated women before me. So it was probably a little shock to hear like, "Hey… " so what did Nate say like.
“I'm going to California.” Instantly went into like, protective mode
make sure who it was, like he's not flying out to see
some random person. Yeah, some little ho online. So then when he showed you me, you were like, “Oh, that's not a chick.”
Right? What was your first thoughts? To be honest, I was just taken back but he seemed
really happy so I was just happy for him, I really wanted to go out and find out
about someone he actually liked. Yeah, so then when he came home
the first few times, how was it? Did you ask him or were you just like,
“Hey, did you have a good time?” Of course, I had so many questions.
-Yeah. I wish I could have been like a fly
on the wall like an interview. I just got the sense that you guys
like really connected. I can tell just from being out here that
you guys are like the same person. I can see each other in both of you and
I love it, I love the connection. I feel the vibes.
-Hell yeah, that's awesome. Did you ever have a talk with
your parents about me ever? Or like, what do they think of me?
Before I met them? Because when I met them, they were so chill and non-judgmental, really cool, so normal and you guys all made me feel
like I was at home the first time I ever came over. And I was scared, obviously
I'm walking into normal family, like when I say normal you know what I mean,
I've seen some gothic mothers out there, y'all are crazy. But like, just a normal family and I'm like,
I'm a little different. So I didn't know what to expect
when I first flew to Michigan. Honestly yeah I thought the same thing,
I wasn't really sure how they would react but I like pretty much wait it out, I wanted to see
the reaction myself, just like you and that's, I don't know It was cool.
-It turned out really well, yeah. Alright, half the battle's over.
So, line the water line, oh my god you guys. Pray. Everyone needs to pause this video and
say a prayer before whatever happens next.  Alright we're going to attempt
to do under eye shadow, so we're going to go back
into the Androgyny palette  and we're going to play with Charm and Fetish
and I'm going to use tiny brushes. Let's see what happens, if your eye starts to water
or hates me just let me know. Like right now? Yep, already doing it. Okay, so normally you're not around the crazy
beauty lights and I have a lot of fucking lights here. So we're going to turn off a few,
we're probably going to  look really like silhouette but I'm just going to see what happens
if we turn off some of the lights. Ooh, look at that highlight though bitch, what.
Okay, let's see what happens, look up. Any light bothering you yet? Let's try a little bit
of Charm under here and then we'll call it a day for this. The waterline, I already know
you guys is not happening, but we'll do it for a laugh. We'll just try it you guys, just for fun.
Now I am going to take a little bit of the… I love this color pop liner, probably not going to
go on your eye, but hey we'll give it a whirl. Here we go, this is going to be interesting.
Your eye is like no bitch, back up. His waterlines even hard to pull down,
you guys, he's not having it. So I think that's all we're going to
get out of the eyeliner. You're doing a good job though, it's fucking hard.
-Yeah, I'm trying. Alright, lights on. Bam. Now I wanted to do more on the lash line like
a little bit, maybe a little bit of Fetish, so we're just going to do this really quickly
before Zach kills me. So look up. Cool, alright. The only part of the eye
we have left is mascara and fucking… the bottom mascara I don't even know if that's possible,
but we're going to attempt to put on the top mascara Alright, so now we're attempting some
bottom mascara, your eyes feel a bit heavy? Little bit. Alright, before we finish the eyes, I'm actually
going to do a little bit of the corner highlight, just a little bit of extra blinding. I'm going to go
back into the Nicole Guerrero Anastasia moment, so this brush is just going to go into the inner
corner of your eye really quickly. One more time, look up.
Then your eye is done being abused. Alright you guys, so since this
look is a little similar to mine, I’m going to go in with the Tom Ford blush
nude lipstick, this is what I'm wearing today. Now Tom Ford is I think one
of the best lipstick formulas. I love it, it is gorgeous.
Now let's see what happens. Alright, now I think to complete this look,
we are going to do a little bit of gloss so I'm going to go in with the Jouer Cosmetics
Lip Topper in shade Skinny Dip. Bam. So besides that, we are going to do some setting
spray and this look is almost complete, you guys. I can't believe it. Alright so you're just going to close
your eyes and I'm just going to set this make-up. Watch the hair. This will feel a little cooling.
Damn, we're going to give you a quick shower, and we're just going to let that soak in. Phew. Okay you guys, we made it through
this journey. How do you feel? What's your overall thoughts, opinions,
comment section down below? I can't imagine people trying to do this
every day. It's a little much for me. Yeah, a little heavy on the eyes.
-Yeah. So now we all know that Zach is not into make-up
around the eyes, which is great since I don't know, unless we do
another video or it's Halloween, I don't picture Zach wearing make-up,
but it was a fun experience. Yeah, definitely. You actually beat your brother because that
mother fucker shed some damn tears, Zach did not. He beat the challenge
of no tearing up. Thank you Jesus, so you were sat really nice. You were great. So thank you so much
for coming on my channel. Thank you for having me.
-Of course, and... if you guys want… I mean, Zach what do you
have that people can follow you on?  You have Instagram, Snapchat really right? Yeah that's pretty much it. I have a Twitter,
I'm not a huge Tweeter though so I wouldn't… Yeah. And you don't have a Youtube channel. There's already people making fake Nate and Zach
profiles all over on every social media so be careful, and if it's not linked through us,
it's a fake one. Thank you guys so much,
I hope you enjoyed this video and we'll see you on the next one.
-See you, guys. Mwah. Bye, guys. 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel hi how the hell are ya now today we're gonna be talking about the infamous and the controversial tart shaped cake foundation now listen girl we're gonna have to start this video off with a few words because I am just at a loss right now I'm at a loss for words but I also got a lot of shit to say so if you've been sleeping under a rock or maybe you've been busy working or fucking your husband I have something to share with you this picture hit the internet last week and it was announced that Tarte was putting out a brand new foundation to go along with their famous shaped tape concealer now I was very excited because this is one of my favorite concealers of 2017 now I know this actually came out all the way in 16 which is important to know this foundation first launched in 2016 2017 it grew into a monster everyone fell in love with it or most of you did including myself so when there was a announcement that there was gonna be a foundation version a lot of us were like yes it might be the new holy grail it better be amazing there was a lot of hype and then the swatches came out so if you have not seen this this was going around online and is basically showcasing tarts shade range for their new foundation so I sat here and I was like crickets that's what I that's what happened so let's have a conversation you guys last year Breanna came in the game and she slayed everybody she basically said hi everyone let's be inclusive and if you're not you gotta go and it was such a beautiful launch Rihanna had a foundation color for almost literally every one every skin tone every undertone every complexion she came in so laid no thief NT Beauty foundation is actually one of my favorites from last year it is amazing and the brand definitely put things in perspective for a lot of people that high if a brand does not have a big shade range why bother and I know there's a lot of opinions about this but girl here's mine if you cannot create a all-inclusive shade range why is the product even being out there was a lot of controversy that went down with this and I am just kind of a little shocked and horrified when I saw this watches it looked like they had 50 shades of white and then like two shades for women of color and I'm it's not acceptable it is literally 2018 so I know a lot of people have done videos on this foundation already it's just hit the market but I have a few more words to say so I've seen a few youtubers already review this now there was an amazing review by Jackie aina and Alyssa Ashley you can watch their video here is the thumbnail and they really go in depth and just they're just brutally honest and I think that's why a lot of people fuck with our channel it's because they say exactly what's up they speak the truth and a lot of people are afraid of the truth part of me didn't even want to review the foundation I know a lot of you want to see in action so I am gonna do it but part of me just feels like girl unless they want to put out a full-range don't bother so while I'm filming this video tart actually went on their IG story and did a little we're gonna call a press release or a response to the controversy and everyone being upset now let's read this together and you guys can decide what you think for yourself so tart went on there IG story which girl you should have done a full post on Instagram you should have posted on Twitter Facebook everything so the whole world could see your response but I guess an Instagram story will have to do we all know by now that we revealed our much anticipated shaped tape foundation and the final shade range that we launched was definitely not a full rapid representation of all of you it may be a little too late but we can assure you that this was not meant in any malicious way we all just got so caught up in the shape tape nation and seeing your tweets asking for it we wanted to get the product out as fast as possible and we made the decision to move forward before all the shades were ready to go they then go on to say we know that there is no excuse and we take full responsibility for launching this way we lost sight of what's really important in this industry and for those who feel alienated in our community we want to personally apologize we're doing everything in our power to bring those unfinished shades to market as fast as we can at any cost we can and we will do better also one thing I want to note is that a lot of people were going in because Tarte disabled their comment section for the post about the foundation so it really made people even more upset like you're literally I don't think the voices of those who need to be heard now it is great to have an apology but to me I feel like some of that is maybe a little too late a woman of color and afterthought to tert are they not good enough so you got to wait to get your shade later I just couldn't imagine being excited for a release now that concealer that they have put out does have a lot of shades but I couldn't imagine being excited for a launch and then you log in to buy your shade and you can't find your color and it really does not exist I mean to me foundation should go from A to Z tart did like a to M skipped a whole bunch and then did like you Z and that's about it so to me it just felt like okay why would you have to put out darker shades later so only white people get to buy your shit first and then everyone is like an afterthought it blows my mind but I think that this is a very important topic to talk about and I think that it is also something that a lot of brands kind of you know put under the radar don't bother putting out this foundation until you are ready with a full inclusive line so another thing that was a little controversial the last two days is that beauty youtuber at nikkietutorials deleted her entire shape tape review and I was like whoa what is going on so after digging in I found out that she deleted the video because people were really going in on the comment section and you know the Internet is the Internet and this is a very hot topic but I think that it's very important that when you do have a huge platform like Nikki with over 8 million subscribers you do not that you have to do things a certain way but you do have a choice to really talk about something and bring it full forward because yes girl they may have had your shade but half your audience then you have their shade so me which I know I don't have as many subscribers as her but I would like to be one of the people to go on record and start the conversation which the conversations already started the whole internet is fucking up roared angry and upset and I just think that people with a bigger audience should speak up about it it's ridiculous you know I saw Nikki's tweet she said you know I got to pull up the screenshot so I don't misquote thank you for showing me the importance of showcasing my voice the tart shade range is an absolute and I should have spoken up about it more than I did my problem with that you've been on YouTube for eight years you know you have a voice girl so you live your life online you saw the shade range you didn't really acknowledge it so here I am I would love to acknowledge it and start the motherfucking conversation I just feel like that is a very important topic and please sound off below of what you guys think I'm very just kind of like shocked to even see this behavior still happening in the makeup world but at last here we are so if you guys want to see me even review this foundation keep on watching if you're over I don't blame you you can log off I don't care but I do want it to you know speak my mind and I think that it's very important to talk to you guys about this subject let's dive into it now there is two formulas there is a hydrating shaped tape and there is a mat shaped tape now I have watched a few people review this which I normally don't do not that anyone sways my opinion I just don't like to see other people use it yet until I try it out but from watching a few people's reviews the hydrating one seems very skin-like and natural which No thank you we're gonna try out the matte one so it looks like this now I did get three shades here which all jokes aside you guys I can't with the shade names we got lights and fair neutral and light neutral now the other shades were like deep dark and mahogany and I'm over here like so anyway I am going to test this out today now this foundation does retail for $39 it's kind of up there this one is supposed to visibly refine pores and absorb shine it has a vitamin E for nourishing the skin no flaking or caking now it does recommend that you apply with a paddle brush so they have put out their own brush which this retails for $28 it's vegan and cruelty free now of course you guys have seen every brand on earth I think right now put out a paddle brush we all know that our teeths was the first one to do it and everyone has followed suit we're just gonna dive in and try this foundation now of course I'm gonna use a primer that I always use everyday so there's no surprises and since this is a matte foundation we're gonna go in with my sicily double tendency are instant and long-term primer this one is amazing she's fuckin pricey but girl does she work all right my neck my ears my forehead my whole face is primed now let's dive in so I guess we have to shade match my face first let's do that now first of all I haven't even seen this bottle yet really having absorb it okay it's cute it's alright what do we have here we have 30 milliliters and 12.01 fluid ounces made in canada and this is of course a full mat foundation all right now let's see which shade is going to work for me the concealer I use is very light now this I'm just gonna do a little swatch test I probably should have done this before I primed but hey see what happens here okay that looks a little yellow for me I am a very cool toned so I don't think I'm gonna live for that one this one is which one is this one fair neutral oh god that's light okay and then we have light neutral let's pray light neutral work so we're gonna have to go in with that one you guys I'm scared okay and then we have let yea this is light neutral okay I think light neutral is it gonna work alright you guys so I'm going to wipe this off but we're gonna go in with light neutral it's a little too yellow for me there's not like that full pink undertone I'm seeing here now I did get this off line so you know how it is when you're trying to match your shade off of a little square it can be a little annoying sometimes so we were going to just wipe that off and then I'm very worried about reviews you guys know I'm gonna wipe this even the residue of the makeup wipe i want completely off my skin there we go alright so here we are with Missa light neutral now I know this is a very thick foundation so during reviews you should probably use a normal amount so everyone can actually see if the product works or not so let's just go in with one swipe here oh that's a lot of product girl and then we'll go down a little bit and let's just see how that looks I mean that's a lot of product we'll do half my face just so you guys can see if and when there's a difference now let's take the brush and let's blender out here is the foundation blended out so I guess we're gonna have to zoom in right here and see now of course I'm gonna look directly in the camera here is the side with foundation of course and here is what you see in real life we have freckles we have a little cut on my lip we have moles and we have some discoloration and then here is the now looking in the monitor it does look a very airbrushed all the discoloration is gone it is definitely a medium to full coverage foundation the color match I'm not like living for but I've also not hating it it is definitely can be build it to a very full coverage now there's no patches it looks smooth it's very like I look like I have a filter on my face what you guys know I'm into that my guess let's apply more on this side but I love applying my foundation with the Beauty Blender most of you guys know that so even though this brush does say its suggest to apply this with the foundation not everyone is gonna buy this or want to use it so let's try to this side with a Beauty Blender now this applicator actually don't mind it it goes on really easy it's not messy and I do like how sturdy it is because it is I'm going to assume this is glass it feels nice and heavy okay let's bounce all right so this is kind of weird blending it out with a damp beauty blender made it apply better than their brush I have to say that right off the bat I'm like whoa now brands always recommend buy a brush with this girl its foundation you can apply it with your fingers with a sponge with a Beauty Blender with a synthetic brush whatever you want girl but just buffing this in actually applied better almost feel like this side with the brush looks a little k here but this cider looks a lot better when I wasn't hating this side it just now that I'm comparing the two I'm like whoa this one is a nicer I am going to add a tiny bit more of this just to see if it will let me add on some extra coverage and let's see what happens now that it's buffed out you can definitely see it is a medium to full coverage foundation there is no denying that I am curious to see if this shape tape concealer works great over its own formula so let's pull out the concealer of course this is in shade fair and let's put some on and see what happens [Music] all right should we try to buff it out with their brush or should we just stick to a beauty sponge I guess we can do both right why not okay so yeah this is blended out all right it kind of took off a little bit of the foundation it looks like let's see this right here and if a lot of you're like girl what the hell are you doing right there this is what I've been doing lately under my contour just so it's so sharp and your cheekbones look like knives but yeah this brush girl I'm not living for it [Music] alright now I'm going to set my concealer like I would always do and let's go in with the RCM a no color powder now we're gonna take our damp sponge and we're just going to lay that right on top of the concealer and the foundation and let's see how it looks as I'm letting the powder bake I'm just adding on a little bit of bronzer and warmth to my face oh right so let's brush off the powder here and let's see how the under eyes and concealer are looking alright so I think I'm ready to give my final thoughts and give you guys the real tea so here we go so I'm sure a lot of you are wondering and you want to know maybe you've already fast forwarded to the end is the tart shaped cake foundation jeffree star approved well here's the problem the formula yes it's good it's not the best thing on earth now what I did put the concealer over the foundation with the setting powder it does look good there's really no creasing it's not bad if my problem is I really don't know if we should support this foundation or the brand until there are more shades and I'm sure a lot of you are gonna be on the same page as me and you're like girl I agree so I'm glad that you guys got to watch me play around with it but I'm not going to improve it based on all the facts that I presented in the beginning of the video I hope you guys can understand that and relate because girl I can not until the brand wants to be fully inclusive maybe y'all should not be wasting your fucking hard-earned coins on it and that is that I'm gonna go wipe this off now but I hope you guys enjoyed this video and thank you so much for watching and I will see you on the next one 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel hi how are ya today we are gonna dive into the infamous Kylie cosmetics brush set bitch the whole internet is fucking shook to the ground and I have never seen this much controversy go down in the makeup world in a long time so when the whole world is talking about makeup brushes you got it you got to wonder what the fuck is going on around here so today we are going to dive into what is the most talked-about beauty product in a long time and of course it is the Kylie cosmetics full brush set now we all know by now that this baby will retail for three hundred and sixty dollars now oh praise the Lord so jesus take the wheel we're gonna give this a go now of course you guys know me I am always down to be brutally honest I don't know about other people on YouTube but I do know that I am one of the only people that has never been paid to say that I like something and I am someone who just keeps it a hundred percent blunt I don't give a fuck if you're famous I don't give a fuck of your brand in the drugstore since I've been doing makeup for about 20 years now yes I started when I was 12 years old baby so I think I know about makeup brushes and I also manufacture and create makeup and brushes and I know the real cost of everything so the truth is about to be unveiled so if you want to know what the hell the T is on these brushes then keep on watching alright so of course this is a first impressions video I have never seen or touched these and I know these brushes are probably out now by the time that this video is live so this is what the brushes come in now I don't feel like I have to do a disclaimer every time I do a comment but I am gonna say this once and I'm gonna say it once only everything I say here is just my thoughts of course if you don't like me already I don't know why you can click on this video but most of you already know what is up and I'm sorry that I have to keep reiterating this stuff but girl the internet is vicious so let's unravel this and I'm just gonna keep it gangster okay for 360 dollars I am very curious why this is I call it vegan leather it's like a plastic faux leather it's obviously not real this does feel very cheap so I'm gonna start the review off by saying this feels like it's from the Dollar Tree just being fucking a hundred percent so as you open this up there are all the brushes to me the silver kind of dinky packaging is not doing it for me the brushes themselves I do like the packaging I think the silver on the actual brushes are cute they do look a little basic looking I do like silver and chrome and that type of stuff of course but overall am i wowed by this packaging no I'm not this overall just feels a very cheap yeah but Arthur brush is good of course I haven't even touched them yet so we are going to do that right now but first impressions what do you guys think of course you're gonna sound off in the comments below while you're watching this but are we living for the packaging it almost looks like like I don't know I'm like looking at this like tin foil it looks like the shit they did in signs when they were like look once you get past the packaging all the brushes of course are displayed here and here is where I think it gets a little weird now when these brushes were unveiled of course the whole internet I had to explode and really go in about the price points Kylie actually tweeted some stuff out so I do want to read those really quickly I'm going to throw those up on the screen and we're gonna just do a quick little paraphrase there was an extreme backlash to the price of course not just my opinion there was thousands and thousands and thousands of people questioning why there was so much money so she tweeted out and I'm gonna throw them up right here I have developed for you guys the most amazing luxury brushes ever I am very excited real brushes don't compare to synthetic brushes different performance quality everything I am a hundred percent down to do an entire synthetic line in the future which will ultimately be cheaper okay then she goes on to say I always fight for the lowest price on all my products here are some other real brush lines for reference few references artistes which I have right here in my hand she also references Kevin of Kwan which I have right here in my hand and I was a little shook I got to be honest I'm like okay I'm gonna read that to you guys one more time I always fight for the lowest price on all my products what is there to fight about if it's your brand you choose the price that they're sold at so these brushes obviously I didn't make them I don't know how much they actually cost to manufacture I do know that when you manufacture brushes the mark-up can be very high depending on your brand so is the price justified of course I'm gonna test them on my face and see how they perform but I don't know you guys I don't think that these brushes cost that much to make I mean let's just keep it gangster here so a little history lesson Kevin is an iconic makeup artist in the 90s he put out books that have changed the entire makeup game and he is a very iconic and he's a legend so I am a little I'm a little peeve that someone who has had a makeup line for such a short amount of time is comparing themselves to an iconic legend girl you better chill also artiste brushes we all know these guys you've seen a million youtubers use these for foundation these are very pricey as well but she's comparing her brush set to these companies and also Mac Mac is legendary baby they have been around for so long and with all the problems that her brand has had thus far I was a little shook at the price point of course alright so I'm gonna do a soft a little look today and try out some of these brushes now there is a lot here I can't use every single one but you guys know after about five or six brushes you know an opinion so first of all let's prime our face since this brush set cost so damn much let's use a primer that cost so damn much and this is the Gucci Gucci face silk priming serum okay so we are just going to do a few pumps all right there now normally I would use a synthetic brush to apply this there isn't one here so I'm just gonna use what is this one number seven alright so I'm just gonna take this on my hand and we're just gonna put this all over our face all right I am primed and ready for some foundation now of course if you use a synthetic brush your brush hairs will not look like this and this is not like a negative so don't take this the wrong way anyone but like you see the bristles sorry no my back drops a little bright and they're just really wet so if you wanted to use this brush for anything else you're gonna have to clean it or let it dry which some people don't like anyway moving on and that was brush number seven as I said let's move on to foundation so brush number six is what I would use for this also way I gotta say one thing you guys for some reason and maybe because this was a PR thing I don't know if customers are gonna get this in the mail but the brushes are like stuck on with little stickers on here I want to show this off because it's just so weird so you pull the brush out and you see that right there so these are like little stickers they almost feel like glue see that but like that weird tacky thing the brushes are like stuck on so when you pull them out they have these like stickers on the back if you guys can see that so I move that closer so they have these little circles that are stuck and maybe that was just the PR cuz they were like rolled out but that is a little weird and then you have to sit there and like scrape the glue off which who the fuck wants to do that after paying that much money mat me so a foundation brush let's put on some foundation now where did that brush go alright so number six is right here and this is a nice domi brush to really apply the foundation and let it hopefully sink into the skin just going with a little Dior forever we haven't used that in a minute now I like to mix zero ten and zero twenty so we are about to do that right now and that is good for now so we dot this all over like I normally would do I'll do half my face right now just so we can see what the hell's going on now let's apply [Music] all right you guys so first impression that's taking me a little longer than normal to apply the foundation of course you see a little shedding here which I already told you guys natural hair does shed is not the end of the world these are of course brand new brushes so as you can see the foundation looks beautiful now the brushes do feel soft is it the softest thing I've ever felt in my life as everyone keeps asking no it's not but it is a soft brush it is nice obviously you see the foundation applied great I do gotta say though when you apply foundation with a natural haired bristle brush it does take longer for some reason because the product is soaking in you got to finesse it into the skin so I will be going in with more pumps usually I can get that foundation to cover my entire face I am having a go on with even more product so just know that and let's finish all right you guys the foundation is a laid definitely took a lot longer than normal my wrist is let go Jesus I have a little bit of foundation left but I used a lot of it so I'm gonna wipe that off so I don't accidentally get that all over myself oh let's move on to concealer now I've been loving the all-nighter Urban Decay waterproof concealer we're gonna use that this is what makes dad used on me and my transformation video last week so let's just put some on real quick all right BAM alright so there's that concealer now there is I think a concealer brush here as well so if you're someone that uses concealers and pots or you just want to paint it on you definitely can do that this is a concealer brush it's also used for blending in the concealer which I don't normally do with these tiny of brushes let's go in with this for a second we're already hating it no I'm just kidding but I would never apply my concealer with this brush I would maybe paint it on but as you see this is not blending so going on to the brush that we used earlier we've dusted her off let's go in this one and see how it wants to look I know this is a video dedicated to the brushes but I also want to throw in a few ideas of maybe doing some comparisons because no one has done that yet they've just only tried the brushes now obviously you can see my concealer it's alright I'm not like living for it it did blend out I just feel like it could have been better and quicker that's just my opinion now I think that it looks alright it's blending cute but I'm like finessing it over and over I'm over it but I do want to pull out on our teeth brush just for shits and giggles so here is one of their brushes what is this one this is the oval 7 now these are of course our synthetic man-made fibers a lot of fibers in these bristles and we're gonna just try it out on this side for fun I think it's very interesting that they say on their website that synthetic or man-made fibers are manufactured and therefore can be more controlled in terms of shape finished diameter length and strength now with animal hairs animals produce different hair depending on your diet the environment the weather so there is no consistency from one animal to another from one season or time of year to another never thought of that ok artis work so I am just going to apply the concealer on the other side just to see if it looks better worse or what my thoughts are so let me put on the exact same amount of concealer all right here is of course the artists concealer side blend it out and then here is the Kylie cosmetics side not that big of a difference I definitely think this one obviously went on way quicker and it just kind of blended out nicely where this side it did blend it just looks a little patchy and maybe like yeah look dry for some reason like the brush hair was like okay baby okay all right you guys concealer of course needs to be set I didn't put the concealer everywhere where I wanted to so I am going to just dab a little bit on my chin or I normally would maybe a little bit right here make this nose fucking I was looking her other brushes like should I try the foundation brush we're just used for a laugh let's do it okay blend it out a little better I almost felt like the hair was like dragging the foundation or tiny bit but definitely worked better than that smaller brush and this one these two are not for concealer girl mm-hmm we definitely need to set the concealer so I would just use a big fluffy powder brush let's see number three looks cute this big dome one and then today we are going to use which I'm excited about the new Patrick Starr MAC Cosmetics collaboration setting powder and this is in shade Patrick's powder I have not used this yet so I am very excited as you see it's brand new all right oh I love that Patrick put this as the sealer instead of those cheap clear ones that you have to like scratch off with tweezers and you just want to like throw the patter across the room I really appreciate this peel-off it's the little things right so I took some of the powder and I put it on here and I'm just gonna take this brush and dip it in Oh a lot goes on here so let's shakes them off and then I'm just gonna literally take it and press it under the skin not under on top of the concealer sorry on the skin whoa okay Patrick I see you girl so from this side to this side I'm like okay the setting powder is not fucking playing right now the brush of course is soft I think it's applying the powder pretty good let's keep going all right setting powder is on concealer is set this so far I'm definitely a fan of can't wait to film with it again now this brush was cute back to the Ruby of course it applied that powder very nice I mean you guys it's setting powder it should apply a really nice and easy so so far all right girl okay I forgot one step which is good because I'm gonna try out this big powder brush this is number brush number one and this is what she looks like here I'm just gonna dust over some powder foundation all over my entire face for a final setting I'm gonna go in with the lemare new sheer pressed powder which I love and we're just gonna put this all over at my entire face alright that is all over the skin it looks very pretty now this brush was um very soft it felt nice and the powder definitely went in all over the skin very nice so alright brush this one is not bad at all I love it it's very fluffy alright so I'm gonna be the little devil over here on my shoulder yes this brush is nice it's fluffy it applied the powder great but I also have one that is literally a tenth of the cost that could do the exact same thing so take that for what it is let's move on now we're gonna pull out the lemare bronzer which I love this is my new favorite and we are going to do a little bit of contouring and we are gonna use what number is this brush number five this is the contour brush let's go into the bronzer of course oh that picked up a lot of pigment which is great because you know I want fucking chiseled cheekbones so there we go all right so something that I really do want to point out here is that goat hair is great for powders and as you can see bitch it looks cute so now we're just gonna chisel this jaw a little bit alright now we are going to take the skin brush and I'm gonna do a little bit on my forehead now to me I would use a different brush for this so maybe I should do that this brush number two maybe let's try it let's do the forehead with this one but definitely worked cute on the forehead now I'm gonna do a little comparison how I would do my bronzer or contour on the forehead I would use a big fluffy brush like this this is from Marc Jacobs Beauty now we all know their brand is a little pricey as well so I'm not comparing the price I'm just comparing that this is actually a synthetic and remember Kylie said that real versus synthetic is the drastically different but at the end of the day baby you forgot to mention that some synthetics can be very high-quality and this feels like butter this is for someone that's like really on the go and you just want to like put something on really quick you can just kind of dust this over your cheek bone area if you don't want the chiseled Geoffrey cheeks but this is really good for warming up the skin very quickly you know no offense but synthetic versus a real hair if this feels pretty similar so my face is looking a little dull we need some highlighter now in the brush set I'm going to assume the fan brush which is number nine that this is a highlighter brush as well as this other little dome looking one number eight I use brushes like this to apply my highlight as we all know let's pull out what I normally would use I love this Kevin a Kwan brush for highlighter it's amazing it's very domi and this is a synthetic of course so let's see how this one performs today what are we gonna do you guys let's use let's use the Pat McGrath skin fetish in shade gold fine gold excuse me so let's take brush number eight and let's go in there and round and let's see what this looks like all right so this applied alright I'm not like obsessed with it I am gonna do a synthetic on the other side because that's just what we're gonna do here so here is the cabinet Quan so let's go in here with the same amount of product that we did with the Kylie one alright how are we loving at you guys here's this side and then here is this side I'm trying to look in the monitor it's hard to tell cheeks are looking cute now let's take the fan brush of course this was the other one that I was gonna assume was for highlighting let's go in to that product and then let's try our key Pizza bow of course okay now that one put it right on the top of the lid ooh okay I think I like how the fan brush is applying it way better than this other one I'm not really sure what this is supposed to be for but I was just trying to compare it to you know similar brushes definitely think that this apply is a lot better than this one all right so let's try out some of these eye brushes we have four right here sorry they're sticking together from a weird glue shit in the package I'm like over it I hate it all right so we're gonna take some of these brushes and see what kind of look we can create today I want to eat someone else's palette because it's like why not let's grab the hood of beauty desert desk palette this one is very cute let's open her up and I am just going to take brush number 12 which is this guy right here it's a little Packer shader brush alright so I'm gonna go in with desert sand right here and yes the bristles picked up a lot of product so let's see if it works all right now we're gonna go in with the eyeshadow brush number 15 this is a shader brush what shade should we do let's do a few here let's first start with shade Eden it is this gorgeous peachy shade of right there and I love using this as a transition shade it's very soft and pretty for those moments when you just want to be a subtle ho though the shade Eden is blending in a really cute love how it's looking it's very soft and dainty moving on let's see what other brushes we can try here we have a little pencil brush we have a little Packer brush there's also this little angled one at number 11 it looks like this let's try her out right here so we're gonna dip into this shade amber right here dust a little off and then let's just go in here for a second and see how we don't look all right so now I'm gonna dip in I'm gonna go back and with this brush right here and dip in to eat in and a little bit of blazing barely right there and I'm just gonna take this and run this under my lash line because I am gonna do a soft look today alright now we're gonna go in with this packer brush this is number thirteen and we're gonna do a little bit of something on the lid here you know I don't know if you're supposed to use like a setting spread with these in here let's just try it without it so let's see how this is gonna look on the lid okay this color has to be sheer because what the fuck okay not sure about that shade it is very sheer I am gonna do a little mac fix+ on the brush and let's see if it sticks better okay there's the effect mommy needed we're going to take the number sixteen brush which is a pencil brush and we're just gonna do a little bit on the lash line and that should wrap up trying and B brushes now I'm gonna go with this shade over here it's called oh you D I'm not gonna even try to pronounce that so there we go oh yes all right the Ilyich is done I'm gonna quickly pop on some liner and some mascara and I will be right back all right you guys the eyes are done now I do need a lip on so I'm gonna go in with the dirty peach Kylie lip kit one of my favorite shades that she's created it love it now something that's a little weird to me is that in this entire brush say there is no lip brush no no a lot of you may say Jeffrey that's what lip liners and wands and liquid lips are for which I am so down for that but if you are like the queen of lips and you're pumped up lips have gotten you this far girl where's the damn lip brush that's all I got to ask and I know that she just launched normal lip sticks today which a lot of people like to paint them on other people clients so there's no lip brush in them brush set which is a little weird so anywho I am just gonna go in with this shade right here dirty peach and let's put it on [Music] all right dirty peaches on it looks we're really pretty with the eye very monochromatic of course we're gonna do a little all-nighter Urban Decay finish spray mm-hmm Oh one for the Holy Ghost all right you guys I think it is time to give my final thoughts all right you guys I know this has been a very controversial topic but I definitely wanted to see what all the hype was for myself so thank you for watching today's video now my final thoughts are are these brushes jeffree star approved they're not let's just keep it really fucking real right now these brushes are not Jeffrey Stehr approved now here's the to you guys a lot of them did work their brushes so hey thank God some of them worked a lot more so than others let's just go down the line here and then I'm gonna say my real real final final thoughts powder brush was great foundation brush I felt like I took way too much time doing my face and I was just dying for a Beauty Blender I'm saying with a concealer did not love this at all for this or this definitely the artiste brush came in and wowed me the eyeshadow brushes the contour the highlight those went on really pretty more so this one than the others but overall for 360 dollars plus tax and plus shipping there is no way in hell I'm gonna recommend to my audience that you guys buy basically a $400 brush set that you cannot touch or feel because of course she's only an e-commerce brand so you are gonna take the risk if you do want to buy these of are they gonna work for you or not now of course I can recommend to you a lot of other affordable brands I know some people think that's shady I just think that it's smart and fair for you guys because this brush set with this cheap old vegan aluminum fucking silver is just not worth the price point I definitely think that you are paying for an overhyped celebrity name and the price I know we're all just like the price I just don't think it's worth it now I know that these are real hair and all that but my advice Kylie toned down the prices a little bit and please give us the Realty on the animal hair and all the information because I think a lot of us out there want to know what the Realty is so you guys I cannot recommend these brushes for you I think they're so overpriced and at the end of the day there are so many other affordable options so I'm sure her dedicated fan base is gonna swoop them up and at the end of the day she's probably sitting at home laughing at all of us because everyone in my entire world is talking about her brand once again so she's good at marketing girl and gotta give you that all right you guys thank you so much for watching today's video I hope you've learned something new sound off below let me know what you really think and I hope you enjoyed it thanks for watching and I'll see ya on the next one mwah

what's up everybody welcome back to my channel today bitch we are doing something that has never been done before here on YouTube you know I'm someone that's a little bit crazy I think you all know that by now but I have done things on YouTube that has never been done before we have done get Reddy's in private jets in the air we have done Rolls Royces where we've done our full face in the back of a half-a-million-dollar car but today we are taking it to the next level and we are going to do a get ready doing a full face of makeup in auto pilot in my Tesla Model X if you've never seen a Tesla in person before let me just give you the quick rundown this vehicle has auto pilot and what does that mean it means that when you are on the freeway you can literally take your feet off the gas off the accelerator you can take your feet off the brake you can take your hands off of the wheel and you can just live your life now of course legally we do need to pay attention to the road which of course we are going to be very safe today but I'm gonna put a few GoPros and cameras in my Tesla today and we're gonna do a full mask using new products and some of my current favorites so what is gonna happen today I have no idea I do want to give you a quick little few tidbits about this I am literally gonna pull it up like I'm doing a review on a pallet that this vehicle has eight surrounding cameras providing 360 degrees of visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range there are 12 ultrasonic sensors that complement this vision allowing for detection on both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system so I know we've seen a few crazy stories on the news about people not paying attention and something horrific happens but I do want to let you know and you will see it in the car when it wants you to hold on to the wheel or pay attention it will alert you so if you're someone that didn't pay attention to that and something horrible happened can't relate so I know a lot of you are gonna be like girl settle down but yes we're gonna be buckled in and let's paint this face and see what the hell happened so before that you guys I'm going to show you a few little scenes of us picking up the car now this was black of course I had a transform pink so let's start this video and see what the fuck happens good morning we are about to go pick up the Barbie Tesla sticker city finished wrapping the entire car and listen I am so excited because you know pink is my favorite color I always have been cars and I've kind of been missing you lately my fleet has just been all over the place or yellow black red I'm like let's get back to being pink so let's go pick it up it [Music] all right you guys so we are here at sticker City the car is already out front I saw as we were exiting the fucking freeway so let's go check it out [Applause] Barbie go long and there it looks so fucking bad-ass like Barbie have a ten seat go home the bitches back I can't wait to take this on the freeway and do autopilot and just wave alright you guys and let's get on the freeway BAM and let's go see what everyone else thinks see you on the other side all right car let's get ready all right we are in the wheel we are buckled in I always drive with sunglasses on but today we're actually getting ready so we are not going to keep them on so BAM now it is a Saturday it's the weekend so there could be horrendous traffic or there could be none you never know what you're gonna get in California or Los Angeles I should say [Music] [Music] so today I'm gonna have my makeup brushes on top of here we're just gonna open them up they're gonna get some little sunbathing today and I've put makeup everywhere we have the whole center console full and yeah we're just gonna get glam and if you've never been in a Tesla before this is airplane glass and it goes all the way up to here so we're going on the freeway let's see it says 25 minutes to the 405 that bad already seeing brake lights okay so we're gonna start this tutorial oh there's my car in black yes hunty alright you guys so we can literally go on autopilot now if we wanted to let's just see for a few minutes our full surroundings and there seems to be some traffic up there and already people breaking all right you guys so there is this big old line here might be on my face for some of the video but you guys know when there's shadows in cars alright so literally we could do autopilot right now and start this face because girl I just looked in the mirror let's not look like the Blair Witch right now so to do autopilot all you got to do is literally it's this lever under the steering wheel on the left so all you got to do is go one two okay and you are literally in autopilot and the car takes over all right we are in autopilot let's turn the radio off now it said please keep hands on wheel for a brief second and then literally you can let go the cars in full control the max speed that I'm allowing it to go is whoa 65 miles an hour so if traffic stops and people start going 75 or more my car will only go to 65 is this fucking weird yes 100% you know I've been driving since I was 16 years old and when you don't have your hand on the wheel it is so bizarre because you're trained forever to obviously pay attention hopefully if you're a good driver the Tesla does brake for you obviously it does everything and it breaks a little harder than I brake so there may be some jerking all right bitch let's look in the mirror lowered my skin are they too dry I don't feel cheap alligator II maybe a little hair clip to put this hair back first we are going to moisturize miss Jace and I'm gonna go in with my trusty tried-and-true a Bobby Brown vitamin-enriched face space one of my favorites and girl we need to prime and prep the skin oh hey neighbor oh she's cute girl there's some beautiful people on the road honey you ever want to just pull over and sleep with someone and then drive to work because that's what kind of vibes I'm in all right we are moisturized now today I actually have a brand new foundation I've been dying to try it is the new Marc Jacobs Beauty shameless youthful look 24-hour foundation that's a mouthful now it also has SPF 25 and yeah let's try it I'm gonna use shades are 250 and 300 into a little mixing today though yeah let's give it a whirl just gonna throw some boxes back there I don't know how full coverage this is though I don't want to but too much but I'm already using a lot now I've gotten ready in the rolls-royce on the back of a car well Nate was driving this is a whole new level of extra because I've never just put foundation on Oh oh my god look at the glass we're going off a bottle pilot holy shit holy shit oh my god there's people over there shit that fell out of there oh my god okay guys back in autopilot that was so scary people were breaking oh shit the cars breaking really hard right now it was scary back in traffic guys we were going like whoa whoa we were going like 65 for a minute now we're back to zero that sums up LA all right so before this dries cuz I have no idea how quickly this foundation dries let's buff and blend before it's too late all right so let's conceal what kind of concealers do we have today honey let's go in with the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD invisible cover conceal all these long names fuck you guys nicole has uses so much on me there it is my girl give me some we're gonna not conceal that much today we don't need to we're well rested

What’s up everybody.
Welcome back to my channel. Today I’m naked and I’m just
trying to live my life. So, I have something really special today.  One of my favorite fashion
brands who have now, of course, entered the beauty
world a few years ago, Christian Louboutin Beauty has put out
some brand new products for the eyes. So if you’re wondering, “Jeffree, where’s
your eyelashes? Where’s your mascara? ? Where’s your eyeliner?” I’m about to try
on some products that involve all of that. So I just kind of did my makeup very minimal, enough where I can try on everything but
 still not look like you know, a dead mole rat. So, I’m really excited because Louboutin
is… oh god, they make the dopest shit. So just to recap in case you’re like,
“What the fuck is that brand?” If you’ve ever seen someone wear
“red bottoms,” this is the brand. Now, look at this loafer. If you’re not
obsessed with this shoe like I am, log off. But no, on a real level guys,
this speaks to my soul. Fashion is like, you know,
they’re like all pieces of art to me. So, Christian Louboutin puts out
shoes, high heels, loafers, sneakers, and they also put out amazing bags. I mean look at that pink color,
are you kidding me? That might be the color
of the inside of my vagina. But anyway, today we’re going
to get back to makeup, of course. We are going to be reviewing and testing
 out a $75 eyeliner and a $70 mascara. Yes! A brand that’s ballzy enough to
price point their makeup that high. But, uh, I mean you’re paying for the name of course.
You’re paying for the stunning packaging.  But, does the formula work?
We’re, of course, about to try it out. So this is one of the cute little
PR packages that it comes in. Now I also got some on my own because there
are more shades than just what came here today. So, this is the packaging
for the eyeliner. Oh my god! We’re just gonna take it out of the box
because I am shookith down to my soul. Look at this, it looks like
a dangerous weapon. Now, everything that I showed
you already has spikes on it. Their brand is very deadly. It looks
 very dangerous. I mean this is everything. Now, if you’d seen their nail polishes
on Sephora or all over the internet, you’d know the nail polish wand
had this crazy spike as well. And then of course, their lipsticks look,
like amazing jewels out of a you know a queen
or a king’s entire life. And I just think that the packaging itself,
it’s beautiful. Now, the mascara, oh my god. Okay, so I picked this up the other day
and I was like, “This box is like heavy.” This mess scares you guys, first of all probably
 the prettiest mascara I’ve ever seen in my life. It is heavy! I’m talking heavy like this
 is like… I don’t know if this is like real metal or what kind of material
 it is but, it is like, “Da-da-damn!” This one feels a little lighter than this one.
This is like a weight, like a paper weight.  And this one is kind of like, more normal. Um, so today we are going to be
testing out both of these on my eyes. Now, I only have one shade of mascara,
of course in the black. But I also have two other colors;
so this is actually, literally, red. Because you know, the iconic, of course,
red from all of their shoes got turned into a liner. So, red liquid liner, which really, not
quite a lot of brands done that before. . So, I’m excited to test out this guy.
And then there’s also two more shades, which are dark navy blue and pitch black.
Which I cannot wait to try these on my eyes. So, if you guys want to see me test out the new
 Christian Louboutin makeup, then keep on watching. So this guy, which oh my god,
I almost poked out my eye. his is the vinyle luminous ink liner.
So this does retail for $75. Good lord, Jesus take the wheel!
This brand is very prestigious and you know, you are of course going to be
paying for the name. Like a lot of products I’ve reviewed before. But, I am going to give you folks
a little tid bit about this product. Obviously I’ve never used it before. So, this product
says that it was inspired by patent leather, a brilliant leather iconic to
the house of Christian Louboutin. This finish is now introduced
by the designer for the eyes. Okay, so basically this is; now, you know
I like to read the website because all the claims are important because if it doesn’t work
or if it does that is what is going to tell us. Okay, well this is what it’s supposed to do,
here is what it’s doing or not doing. So, this product is highly pigmented ink with a glossy
sheen for the eyes that are lined with intensity. So, you know a lot of times when liners
dry they are matte black or they are matte. This one is of course allegedly
going to have a glossy finish. It’s soft and flexible texture ensures
that the formula applies with integrity. Oh! I’ve never heard a brand say, “Integrity,”
before in their description; I like that. Faceted like a precious stone and slender like a dagger
with clean lines paying homage to calligraphy. Okay, I love, I mean, I’m a packaging whore. If you’ve been watching my channel for a while
you know this bitch loves some good packaging. It also says, it’s innovative flocked applicator
delivers the finest colour payoff and ultimate precision without needing to be reloaded,
allowing for both fine lining and bold tracing All-day wear. Smudge-proof. Smear-proof.
Humidity resistant. God damn! I feel like I’m at the doctor right now. Like I mentioned before,
there are three shades. And that’s it. So also, in case people want
to know about the, like ounces and stuff. This has 0.135 fluid ounces,
which is 4 milliliters. Um, alright, I think it’s time
to test this mother fucker out! Now, of course the hand has
a different texture than the eye, so I’m going to just quickly swatch
the colors on my hand for you all to see. First color I’m just dying to go in. I just love
black liner. So, this color is called, Coal. Great. So, it looks something like this. And of
course, this unscrews and there she is, work.  Alright so, the applicator I’m just gonna show this
to you right here and it’s very slender and fine. So, I’m just gonna take this on the back
of my hand and let’s do one little swipe. Holy shit that is… oh wow that is dark black!
Um, okay, work! I’m just gonna kind of trace the lines here. That is a very nice pay off. Okay, cool,
amazing. Let’s swatch the navy blue one. Now this one is called, Lady Twist. That’s a cute
name and I don’t really know what color this is. Oh! It is literally like navy in here. Okay, cool.
So, let’s give this one a little swatch. Oh wow! The color is cool. It looks to be
a little more streaky than the black one. It says you’re really not supposed to dunk
back in, but I might do that anyway. But the color’s cool; it’s almost like a… I thought it was going
to be more like navy but it’s more like a hot teal type of color. And now, you know, I’ve been dying to try
this red. This is the rouge Louboutin liner and let’s see what she looks like. Oh, wow!
Alright, and let’s give her a swatch. Oh, wow! That is hot red! The red one looks to be, I don’t know,
we’re obviously going to try it on the eyes. I don’t want something is really streaky or kind of
streaky yet, but on the hand it does look a little more, I guess less opaque than the other two,
but we’re going to let this dry for a second. Alright, so it’s been about five minutes, and this I think dried
 completely. I’m just going to press it hard with my fingers, nothing really. Let me go down, literally nothing.
 Like we’re talking, what’s up hand, how you doing girl? Wow, okay. I mean it said smudge-proof and
smear-proof and that is definitely accurate. This sh*t is fucking dry. Now, it’s only
fair to test it out on my eyes. So, I’m going to grab the black one. Shade called
 Coal. And I’m just going to grab a mirror here. Yes. I’m just going to go directly in here.
Alright, here we go. I mean that is some black liner y’all. Okay, now it says that you’re really
not supposed to dunk again.  I think it just… but I’m going to go
in one more time in here. Quick little side note, is that the actual brush, I just wish it was almost more like thicker at the base
and then it like came to more of a point. It’s not like letting me put eyeliner on
as best to what I’m normally use to. But let me, ah, finish and
then I’ll tell you the rest.  Alright, the liner is dry. Now let me
just give you some quick thoughts. Or, I think I actually want to try out
the red one first to see but, it’s one of those formulas where you can
kind of feel it on your eye, if that makes sense. Like it’s not so lightweight where it’s like non-existent.
It’s definitely like has a more heavy feel. You can kind of feel it on;
not like that’s a bad thing. I can just tell from one eye that this is
a little more heavy I guess if you will. Now, the brush I think is maybe
my only complaint about applying it.  I think it could have went on a little more
smoothly. It’s just kind of like a little more; I don’t know I had to kind of finesse it a little bit. But when they say smudge-proof, like this shit
is not coming off which is amazing. So, I’m going to actually try the red liner on the other eye.
So, I’m about to look a little funky if you will. Let’s give this one a whirl. Alright, now I’m going to be doing
one more dunk in here. Alright you guys, the red is dry and on my eye.
I kind of love this two-toned liner effect going on here. So, this one had the same kind of brush moment
where I wasn’t like obsessed with the brush. But the product went on, I think even
a little better than it looked on my hand. Obvious my eye, you know the skin on my
eyelid is a little more nice than the hand. But, I love this shade. It definitely was not
streaky. I think the color pay off was good.  I’ve never really worn hot red eyeliner before.
I’m kind of in to it to be really honest. Wow! Okay. I’m pleasantly shocked at red liner.
I did not know what to expect at all and I am pleasantly surprised. So, cool. OK, I’m gonna see how this wears after
we try the mascara. So, let’s move on. Next product I’m going to be trying
out is their mascara. So, this is called the Lash Amplifying Lacquer mascara. Now, there’s also a bunch of crazy French words; you guys know I always botch them,
I’m not even going to try.  I’m not going to try to say that because
y’all gonna slap me across my mouth. So, basically this says, the product description.
It’s supposed to deliver a dramatic volume, enhancing the definition, length,
lift and curl of the lashes. Provides highly concentrated
pigments for fierce color that sets with a luminous finish
for impactful color that last all day. So basically, I can suck a dick with this and mymascara
won’t run down my face. Thank you, Jesus. Alright, it also says, it’s designed with a brush uniquely comprised of both vertical and horizontal bristles  to ensure smooth and precise application.
Okay, well, we’re gonna test that out in a second. The bristles at the tip, of course, at the tip of the brush
lift and shape even the smallest of lashes. This packaging is intricately ribbed brass
which is reminiscent of Art Deco architecture. I mean, you already know
I’m obsessed with this packaging. It’s fold silhouette is topped with a delicate
black shiny crown dressed in spikes and is encased in a jewelry-like box.
All-day wear. Flake-proof, smear-proof and again humidity resistant. Now this was made in Italy,
but assembled in America. This product has no silicone,
is fragrance free and without TEA. TEA, I don’t even know what that is.
Well, we’ll look at it later. Now this comes in two colors;
one is like a burgundy  and then of course we have the jet
black color. So, let’s give it a whirl. Alright so, let’s open her up and, oh wow!
Okay, so it has a big applicator. Alright so, I’m going to, I’ll try
the one with the black liner first. And of course my lashes have no primer on them,
they are just bare, from me waking up. So, let’s try it on. Alright, I think I’m gonna let that
dry before I do the bottom lashes. So, let’s see the difference between the eyes.
Alright, so the mascara is on, of course, only on this eye. So, I’m gonna give you guys a little head turn
to see if you guys can notice the difference. Of course, this side is blank and naked.
And then this side has the mascara. Alright, now let’s do the bottom lashes
before I give any options or thoughts. Okay, so this is gonna sound probably
a little strange to you guys, but I actually like  how the brush applied the bottom
mascara really versus the top. I think that the top mascara looks cute. It is very black,
which I love. You know some mascaras,  it’s almost like on the gray side where you’re like,
“This could be a little more black.” It’s definitely there; the pigment is strong,
it coated my lashes great.  I just feel the top lashes could be
maybe a little more separated. But the bottom ones I’m kind of like living for.
It looks very like, I don’t know, high fashion. I love how it’s like very thick. I mean,
the pigment is there, it’s amazing.  But, um, I don’t’ know. Let me do this eye.
Well let me show you guys, first of all, the difference.  I mean this eye compared to this. Obviously,
you guys can definitely see the difference down here.  Up top, not like obsessed with it, but I’m living
for this moment. Very, like 60s Twiggy.  Alright, I just applied the mascara to the red liner
side and I mean it’s been about 10 minutes. I took a little break; walked around the house for
a second and I think I’m ready to give my final thoughts. Alright guys, this may not surprise anyone here but, I don’t think that I can really justify the price
point for the results that I got today.  I mean here’s the battle
with review luxury items. You all know you are paying for this brass
metal, huge, stunning beautiful packaging. I don’t know what people think high
price points are going to bring them; I mean mascara is mascara. Of course there are
different wands. Did I necessarily love this wand?  I mean it was cute; it wasn’t horrendous. Definitely love the bottom lashes way
more than the top. I think the top, it did what a normal mascara, maybe even
from the drug store would do.  It’s kind of basic, there’s nothing
mind blowing about it. I think the packaging, how it looks,
is mind blowing. It feels like a, like a brick and it’s amazing.
I love the feeling of it. I love looking at it. I think if you love to put things on your
vanity and you like collecting things; this is a really cute collection for you. But I don’t think that the mascara is worth $70. Overall, because you’re
really just getting mascara.  I think you know something like even Benefit
roller lash mascara even might be a little better. I kind of like that wand better, for me personally. I don’t think my lashes look any more amazing
or crazy than they normally do, if that makes sense. Moving on to the liner. Now I do love this packaging obviously,
it is deadly. I’m like, “Oh, hi Dexter.” But, all jokes aside; I love how this looks.
Obviously it’s stunning. If this was sitting by my vanity,
it’s obviously gonna get a lot of attention. Now the formula, now that it’s
been more than five minutes; it doesn’t really have that heavy affect maybe
because it’s both, because you know, it’s  on both eyes. I’m not really noticing it. The black liner
was very pigmented as well as the red. The red was like a tiny bit more streaky but,
you guys see full coverage on my eye.  I mean I can’t really complain about that. I just don’t think that the formula
was like mind blowing where you know I couldn’t pick up a MAC
liner or something else or a Tarte liner and kind of get the same affect. Do you know
what I mean. I just didn’t love the tip. You know, but I really didn’t love the tip. I felt like
it should have been a little more pointed I guess. It just kind of like dragged a little.
It almost made it a little bumpy, or a little streaky where I’m definitely.
I’m just like OCD right now. I just want to go up and clean it
with a brush, so bad. But, I wanted you guys to see the real results.
It’s not like a crazy negative for me. I didn’t hate this at all. I also didn’t love it.
I keep saying it, I’m obsessed with packaging. That’s just who I am.  But I really can’t
justify $70 and $75 price points  for you guys out there because I didn’t get my,
you know, my mind blown away with the results. All in all you guys. I think is this going
to get a Jeffree star of approval? Sadly, I don’t think so. Now that is not where
it’s like in previous videos where I’m like, “Oh my god the formula flopped.”
 I just think for the price point it’s like, “Damn, bitch like chill out.” But hey,
that’s the brand you’re paying for right. Now, I’m gonna go on a date with Nathan
and by the time that you guys are watching this  I’ll be on Richard Branson’s Necker Island
with Benefit cosmetics; with Manny and Nathan and
Laura Lee and everyone else. So, I’m probably getting a sunburn right now.
But, um, thank you guys as always, for watching and I’ll
see you in the next one. Bye guys. 
what's up everybody welcome back to my channel I literally just landed back from Bora Bora I had a crazy week with Nathan for his birthday and all my best friends came with me it was magical we will definitely be having a vlog on my channel next week okay before we dive into the drama I just quickly want to mention that everyone has been dying to know the release date I'm going to exclusively start announcing on my channel starting today that the many MUA jeffree star cosmetics bundle is back and if you haven't seen the packaging here is the new or revamped one because inside there will be a brand new highlighter which we will reveal later this week but the bundle and all the items that are in here the new highlighter the old highlighter eclipse and both liquid lips will also be available individually but if you want the bundle will be $50 and it will be launching September 9 so while I was away the infamous k'kaw Beauty powder contour and highlight kits launched and the whole internet has been waiting for my damn review so hi I'm right here last week girl the internet and then media they really are trying it so of course I have to address it if I'm gonna review this product last week I tweeted something out right here and I said Kim girl why does this powder look chalky basically Kim K went on her snapchat and she was watching her powders and I woke up that morning and the Internet is so funny like y'all are crazy my whole Twitter feed was Geoffrey what do you think about the powders oh my god they look crazy they look insane widen look so dry like the whole my whole feed was nuts and everyone was like what do you think about it and I'm like rubbing asleep out of my eyes like what do I think what is going on here so I go to Kim's snapchat and I watch it all and I'm like girl them powders like sounded dry on her snap like they just like looked a little chalky so of course my tweet went a little crazy everywhere and everyone started talking about even more and then it turned into a circus you all know I am very abrasive with my opinions I'm always a very honest and I really don't hold back but I'm just a very honest person and when I see something like that I'm like but I also come from a very sarcastic silly place and of course if you don't know me personally or you haven't been following me for a while you don't know that that's kind of my humor so I put up that picture which you guys saw and then let me zoom in and this was her on her arm so I screenshot at her style and I put it up and I was like oh my god think these looked a little rough which the majority of the internet agreed with me okay then all of a sudden a few hours later I'm filming I'm packing for my trip Kim goes on snapchat and references me and guys I see that my fans are totally hating on someone like Jeffrey star for being you know honest about my struggles because of his remarks I'm learning like from the best like from Mario like how to Squatch properly so guys like and I see you being so petty bringing up things in his past where he you know was you know negative but he's also apologized for those things and I get it's a serious deal if you say like racial things but I do believe in people changing and people that apologize I will give them the benefit of the doubt and accept you know that people change and move on and I know better than anyone that I hate when people bring up my past or mistakes that I've made in the past so let him live like I welcome honest you know comments about my products and because of it I'm just watching better now so so everyone get off his ass and let's not be so negative we're all in this together there's room for all of us love you Jeffrey the whole internet turn into a bloodbath so I get texted by a lot of people even my family like oh my god Kim is defending you on her snapchat and she's telling everyone to like stop judging you for judging her like swatches and I'm like what the so basically Kim was actually owning up to the fact that she really didn't know how to swatch which I gotta say one thing and I know a lot of you out there were questioning her ability and wondering why okay if you're gonna make a makeup brand and show it off and make products how the hell do you not know how to swatch which is a great question some moving past that Kim said that she was not even mad that I called her out and she knew that she's not great at swatches and that she's still learning and that she appreciated the feedback now obviously if you know anything about her she also has kind of a sarcastic humor and if you've ever seen their TV show she's down for some laughs so I got on snapchat and I was like okay Kim like thank you because I was just being honest I wasn't trying to be evil I wasn't trying to be shady but of course her following is a hundred times bigger than mine and her fans came for me so hard for judging her swatches and of course what do we do every time we have a feud whether it's with Kylie with Kat Von D you with Too Faced with everyone that I've ever had drama with I'm always down to expose some truth to you guys because this beauty community is very crazy and there's a lot of behind the scenes stuff that the audience does not get to be you know witness to or see and I have definitely exposed a lot of things and it makes people very angry so every time that there is an online feud or a fight we always have to reference the same song-and-dance of comments that made 12 years ago you know Kim even went on her snapchat and said hey I met Jeffrey with a clean slate I don't judge him the past is the past and she basically said for everyone to get over it she basically meant for everyone to get over like harassing me like leave him alone get off his back but a lot of people took it for hey Kim you can't tell us to get over what I said which you guys look that we're beating this subject into a dead horse I love everyone I don't give a what anyone says whether it is Us Weekly or TMZ or anyone that wants to keep reusing the same 12 year old subject you can't tell me I'm racist bitch because I'm not and yes I said some up things a long time ago really every time that I get into a feud we're just gonna keep referencing the same thing you can't tell me I'm something out not everybody so okay I wake up the next morning and Kim went on a whole snapchat rant about me and I wake up the next morning to all of this all these crazy news stories literally hundreds of them I was shocked I looked at my phone and I was like oh boy now I know a lot of you are probably gonna be like Jeffrey you love drama you're all into that there's a difference between drama and truth and integrity and I've always been about giving you guys the facts a hundred percent the facts you know no one can buy me I don't give a  who you are but I woke up to a lot a lot of hate and craziness and there was so much media attention on this subject because of Kim I got thrown under the bus a little bit now she did reach out to me I do want to put that on record because so many fake stories are out there kim reached out to me the next day we spoke on the phone we're all good obviously I'm about to review her Park because yes she did still send me her makeup so there's a lot of news outlets that are like Kim hates Jeffery and retracted what she said in like I don't even know what the I'm getting on a airplane going on vacation and the whole world is going nuts so when you deal with someone at that volume of like fame you are in the mix so I just want to say one thing and then we can move on is that thank you to everyone out there that supports me that watches my videos that has bought in my makeup brand that has even just liked a picture and that is just supported me and you know me you know that whatever the media says it's full of here's the thing that I want guys to really think about and digest because the like media is very scary it is all calculated they want to make money off of people's misery off of people's pain if there is a divorce if a celebrity breaks up with someone else if there is any sort of anything if there's a DUI it is everywhere so what do I have to deal with I have to deal with everyone regurgitating the same song and dance from these old high school videos and people trying to make me seem like I'm a certain way but no one ever wants to talk about the positive and you know I'm definitely on a you know different path that I'm started for running my mouth and making this intro so big but I just want to let you guys know that dramas drama but really take it with a grain of salt and remember that these people love making money off of this stuff so you know you even saw it last year from Kat Von D drama to now people have used my name to get clicks people have lied people have made crazy stories about me that have literally never happened people have photoshopped tweets and Instagram posts that I've never even made sorry for that long rant but yeah this has turned into a crazy circus but I do want to note that if you are someone that is on the fence about me or you think that I'm all in it for the drama I declined every single interview from CNN to TMZ to the Daily Mail to the New York Times to every single person that emailed me and called and reached out and wanted me to ship top cam around my gums I'm good I was in Bora Bora sucking dick and relaxing and drinking Red Bull on the stand and enjoying time with my best friends because I am NOT into feeding into that garbage so moving on if you want to write a story about me to get clicks and make ad revenue and make money off of me I can't stop you but my following and the millions of people out there watching are not stupid so anyway if you want to see me review these damn powders and get to the review and then keep on watching alright so this package you guys I feel like I'm lifting weights it is heavy now I really haven't seen that many reviews on this yet I know that they just launched a few days ago so everyone will probably getting in the mail very shortly so I am really excited to try these because after the swatches bitch I was like alright now this PR package is very heavy you guys it stays with her whole nude theme of course my cell phone you see the huge mirror which is nuts and of course it comes with all three kits with three brushes which is pretty cool so this is like this is a nice package okay now let's dive in so of course I am going to review what I think would probably fit my skintone which is the light kit this is the brush now these retail for fifty two dollars individually you get the kit and a brush when you order it and I know what's funny I'm gonna say something real quickly is when I reviewed the cream contour I liked the formula it works for me I know a lot of my other friends like Tati and Laura Lee they liked it as well but so many people were mad that I liked it and then when I read her for not liking something it's even crazier so with the internet you guys you can't ever win you just gotta keep doing you all right so this comes with four shades of course and I'm sure you guys have seen it all over the internet by now so let's open her up and see what you get for fifty two dollars it does feel nice it is heavy now immediately it reminded me of this guy so I'm just gonna say it the same exact measurements okay let me just open this up here this is of course the Kylie wet set if anyone ever wonders if the same lab makes the product which is not a bad thing I just want to put that out there hootie-hoo there you go so these will literally look like the identical component except this one has a little bit more of a gap here while the kylie one is a little slimmer now when i say that this same lab makes their products that is not a negative my lab also makes a bunch of other brands as well obviously i'm not their only client so if this product you guys has 0.26 ounces in each pan which that is actually a lot of product this feels heavy very heavy actually as a very big mirror which i love and of course you see other colors here there are two highlights highlights meaning metallic glows not to highlight with like a flat matte powder so these are metallic shimmers now these two i've seen a lot of people judge the bronzers online they're trying to say that this one is like very orange yes it does look on the more warm tone side and this is very cool which i love because i am so we will try it both today maybe just on this cheek this on that one and then of course we'll try the highlights duh cuz I'm a highlighting whore now there's not a lot of instructions about the brush or anything on the box but of course and that's what the internet is for let's read what this is exactly supposed to do so contour shade sculpt and highlight with the KK Beauty powder contour and highlight and get the soft buildable powder formula makes application easy and blends effortlessly for a seamless look the pressed powder quad features two mattes ideal for sculpting the hollows for the cheeks hairline nose and jaw line to shimmer highlight shades for brightening and adding glow to your of course everything cheekbones keep a bow nose corners of the eyes collarbones vagina radiant shimmer everywhere layer the to shimmer highlight shades for a more intense glow okay so they want me to do both on one use the angled brush to apply and blend the contour and the rounded brush for highlight so one of the things come with the brush you guys know Iowa from it because if you love your own brushes why not use them so I definitely have my own little three that I use when I'm contouring now if I don't like this brush I will go to this this brush could be great now the first brush we all know this one from the cream contour it was alright this one did blend out people were mad but I liked it like it blended out I don't know what to say this side was a definite flop now I know that you can take these off and interchange them so if you have one one you can put this one on this and keep this as you see they are the same thing so I think it's only fair that we zoom in on the pan and let's see what happens when I touch it once because that's what I do so let's see here okay look at one hit alright so of course from hitting it a few times there is definitely some payoff on the brush of course as you see right there is it even I don't know I can't tell so I guess let's just put this on the hollow of my cheek and see what the hell is going to happen now I always tap off my brush once OH okay work now let's see what happens [Music] now said that it's buildable which obviously it's not like the craziest pigment which I don't want anyway because I don't want to have to blend out just from doing a few little like hits in there okay it's obviously showing up on my skin let me do a little bit more now the brush it does feel like I'm gonna say semi soft like I feel soft but on the skin I don't know if I like how it's blending I mean it's you know it's blending so now we have of course this side which has nothing let's turn and show this side now I heard a lot of people complaining about this being way too warm I'm not like I'm not mad at it so let's just take it a little bit more and let's see what happens and we can even do our jaw oh girl okay huh that showed a girl okay I think the more I like dip in it really held the pigment onto the brush so I'm gonna take the opposite side and just go over it of course this has no product on it I love miss like it better on my cheeks versus on my jaw it almost looks a little more like Oh Lord girl now of course let's do the forehead a little bit now I would never use this brush to do my forehead I think that it's too like it's too thick which you probably hardly ever hear me say out loud again so I'm just gonna take this morphe brush and just dab in two there once all right let's see what happens all right so it's looking subtle it's not looking too crazy now I do want to say one thing that I'm a little shocked about like I was expecting this to look really orange on me but obviously you guys if you follow me on snapchat you know I was just you know on an island in Bora Bora in Sun all day and you know I'm an anti-aging whore I hate being in the Sun but there's a few times a year when you just got to let your your body live and my ass got tan my face got some Sun that was jet skiing and swimming with sharks and stingrays so maybe I'm liking this because I personally am a little more tan myself but I'm not mad at this now my forehead you guys looks a little patchy only because this brush I mean it's hard to get into the hairline I'm just gonna be honest I think after my hair surgery I feel like pigment does not stick right by my hairline I don't know why I can do everything in my power and unless I like put it into my hair it looks able to the patchy so I think it's only fair that we try the very cool bronzer color on this side and let's see how we feel you guys I'm just gonna grab a clean brush from the medium kit so we've already had product on this one I don't want to dirty it up so we will put that okay alright so we're gonna take this you guys on a clean brush and let's go into the other bronzer and let's get some product in there as you see she looks like even more not pigmented but more like fall out and a little dusty than that side alright so this definitely is a damn it's that cool ass bronzer so let's see what it looks like on my skin okay so let's just do a little comparison so here is the more warm contour on this side and then let's do a little turn and here is the cool side which one do you like better obviously you guys want to sound off below but they don't look too far off even though obviously in the pan and I will swatch them with my fingers in a second they are two very different colors but on my skin they're not like reading that far off I don't mind this at all on camera this one is definitely a little more my like tone for the jaw but of course we guys should do the nose as well somebody's a little Charlotte Tilbury brush now of course you guys I'm going to use another brush and guess what you know I had to have two for this so we have the warm side over here and then now we will dip in with a fresh brush with the cool side [Music] all right so I did the contour a little harsh on my nose you can really see the colors I don't even know which one I prefer like this is a more warm side I'm just diffusing it a little bit with the powder brush and then here is the cool side they're not that drastic on my face which is kind of bizarre because they are very different in the pan so before we do the highlighters let me just take these and I'm just going to do a little finger swatching myself okay let's do it on my hand so of course let's just do a little BAM obviously powder and I'm always amazing back and forth like you know should we ever care or trust finger swatches and of course you don't use your fingers to apply your beautifully airbrushed eyeshadow or your contour so you know I think that finger swatches are great for showing colors for Instagram and snapchat but at the end of the day you're not gonna use your fingers to put on the contour so yes Kim swatches were very rough for her makeup artist Mario shoutout to Mario hey girl he came on her snap and showed her how to swatch better and the pigment was definitely way different when he kind of went in way harder probably who knows if she was touching and good enough or like how but anyway looking at this they don't look bad on my skin at all but they are very two different colors and I actually like both all right now let's dive into these two highlighter shades one of course is a very cool tone are they blinding are they not I guess we are about to see I will use both of the highlighting sides of the brush to try these out so let's just dip in and see what the hell is going on here I don't know how big many of these are so I don't want to I don't want to douse my whole head and highlighter well I do but you know what I mean so we're just gonna be a little careful here oh I'm looking in the monitor like oh oh right girl I mean you know she loves a glow I love highlighters and the Sun feels really soft which is kind of not shocking just I didn't know it was gonna be like that wow this is actually way prettier than I thought it was going to be and it definitely has some shine it looks nice it's not like too overwhelming which you know I do like that as well okay so that is this color by itself let's grab the other brush and try this by itself and then we'll mix and match oh this one even looks more metallic just from touching it let's see and definitely I'm wrong so this one to me is way more like subtle this one is more light okay so this side is definitely not as blinding as this side I'm actually not living for this color by itself as you guys can see it is not as reflective it's very subtle which of course Kim is not into a blinding highlight this is more my style so if you are someone that is not into that either you do have both options but I think it's only fair that we take this and put it on top of this and let's see what we got did that do much or do that not do that much I mean I could kind of see it but yeah I didn't tend to fight it for some reason but it doesn't like us crazy over here so I guess let's take this color and put to put on top of this okay cool so you guys see how they look definitely loving this one a lot more than that so I am going to take this brush and just do the tip of my nose all right I'm just gonna take this brush real quickly and do a little inner corner highlight of course oh hello a lot of products picked up on that brush now I already have a little bit of color in there from something else but I'm just gonna kind of tuck it right over here there you go I had a more of a golden tone this one is very white okay in a corner I mean if you really want to take an inner corner and have a moment there you go now the other side I'm just gonna take that brush and see if it wants to work over here all right you guys know I had no idea what to expect of course when I saw them finger swatches I was like girl okay I gotta try this for myself and yes oddly enough they blend amazing on the skin you guys saw the bronzer shades they blended really nice I think I even like this site more maybe because I am a little more you know more tan now this one is still really pretty I love how this looks as well I would honestly use both of them I'm not mad at them at all they worked good there was great pigmentation now the highlighters I really loved this one obviously you guys saw me just use it it is very light I almost wanted to go into the medium kit and try that highlighter in the future as well this one of course you guys just saw me not really into it is definitely more for the subtle person who is not into a beacon of light on their cheek so if you are that person you are going to love this one this one is actually very intense as you see here here here here and here no I'm not like hating this brush either I felt like you know like I said I would not personally use this day to day I would go into what I know and love because those are my tools and that's what I get ready with but the brush I like this one a lot more than this guy bitch come on this did blend the contour nicely I would have preferred my own brushes I probably would have done it quicker but it got the job done I'm not you know I can't say it didn't work this side of course put on the highlighter very thick so if you're someone that wants a little bit more subtlety you know where it's gonna go in with our little morphe 510 brush and keep it really real here because this is a lot easier I think that for highlighting this is very big and some people our faces like put Laura Lee's head next to mine girl I look like a horse let's get a round of applause because the k'kaw beauty powder contour and highlight kids are sour food I know a lot of you were probably a little shaken and shook by hearing that right now but yeah they are all drama site if a product works bitch a product works and I think that's always what I'm gonna be about I don't care if I'm dragged through the mud I'm still gonna try this  and I'm still gonna be honest with you now do I think this is worth fifty two dollars I don't know that's where it go look to me you guys I know you're all gonna bawl your eyes like bitch you don't care and I really don't for me personally I'm down to spend money on makeup because it's my entire life and world so I'm always gonna buy the do I think everyone out there watching should buy this in particular if you already have your favorite contour powders no obviously fifty-two dollars is a lot for for little shade you know you can get something even cheaper from like lower back at Ulta and there are three shades and you know two mats and a shimmer and it's obviously a little less costly besides that I will definitely try out the medium kit highlighter and I will try this for a few weeks and you never know it may've fallen to me using it a lot I may never use it again only time will tell alright you guys thank you so much for listening to me ramble and try this stuff out and thank you for watching another jeffree star approved review I will see you guys on the next one mwah bye guys
