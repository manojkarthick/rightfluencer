I think this was something inherited from the time my parents spent living in London  and how festive Regent Street is this time of year. Once I made my way to New York  long walks from Central Park down 5th Avenue with my family (and now  with Frankie  too)  have become one of our favorite December activities. Even though I didn't grow up celebrating Christmas  I can't help but love this time of year and how sparkly and joyful and energetic December always feels ‚ú® My (ridiculously comfortable  totally walkable) heels are from DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse available here:  http://rstyle.me/~cz-adimM_ #MyDSW.

Secret revealed: I kind of LOVE historical fiction  and recently started a deep dive into The Crown (about Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs transition to power after the passing of her father  King George VI). So excited to play with (and wear?!) these crowns at #29Rooms - in celebration and anticipation of Season 2 which starts this Friday!! PS  to my English dad: I know you have my Netflix password if you want to catch up and watch this with me. PPS  long live Meghan Markle. üëëüëëüëë The Crown Netflix  Inc. #29rooms #iworkwithnetflix. After a long couple of shoot days last week  I took a moment to pause and actually feel really  deeply proud of what Gabi and I have accomplished this year. I feel like we are so often socialized to downplay our achievements  and to hold in a feeling of pride (whether about our success or appearance or literally anything). It‚Äôs taken a lot of learning and unlearning to realize I‚Äôm allowed to celebrate myself - ALL parts of myself | Wearing Elomi Lingerie under my sheer Premme top #elomiallyou. So excited to share our Premme Holiday Collection!! Live now -- plus up to 40% off select styles and free US shipping with the code "HURRYBABE". It's #blackfriday and we've launched our first ever sale at Premme  with select styles up to 40% off PLUS free shipping in the US with the code FOODCOMA https://premme.us/collections/sale. I had a much needed (but still outrageously busy!) couple of weeks in New York. I'm back in LA now  and reflecting on the time I spent with friends  queer community  peers & colleagues  and collaborating with fellow makers. It has been a tumultuous year for me; I've been down the path of many existential thought processes where I've challenged myself to think about where I'm most at home (hello  Saturn return). What makes me feel most comfortable and at ease  where (geographically) am i most myself  and in what ways do I feel best in inhabiting my own body? Partnering with Elomi Lingerie and working with artist Suma Jane Dark on a portrait project had me confront many of those questions and really check in with myself. Old insecurities that I thought I'd long said goodbye to had started creeping in again. Self-love isn't always a sure thing; sometimes it ebbs and flows and we're challenged to love ourselves  and sometimes our surroundings and context have a great impact on that. Seeing myself in these elomi pieces  and shooting with my friend Lydia Hudgens Photography for a fun  intimate  carefree moment in my home  brought me back to myself -- and it's a self I'm learning to fall in love with all over again. #elomiallyou. A few weeks ago I met Suma Jane Dark in LA to shoot portraits with her in collaboration with Elomi Lingerie. I'm not going to lie - even though I'm in front of the camera all the time  I always get really nervous whenever I shoot with a new photographer  especially when I don't know exactly what to expect. Elomi partnered with 5 women artists to each create portraits that showed a more intimate portrait of their assigned muse. Suma wanted to explore the ways we see ourselves versus the way the world sees us -- and I realized my nervousness was  at least in part  rooted in being forced to confront that I still worry to some extent about how other people view me. Suma had a whole crew taking portraits of me from different angles while I was taking selfies and then layered them all together in one composition. I always remind people that self-confidence is a journey  and everyone - EVERYONE  has good days and bad days where they feel self-conscious. I guess photoshoot days are still one of mine  but I loved how Suma's piece turned out  and seeing how people responded to it was a really empowering moment.  #elomiallyou. Even with all the privilege I have in navigating the world (my middle eastern heritage is hidden behind my pale skin  my queer identity is often invisible  and I'm of able body)  I've been challenged by the external limitations imposed onto me. Whether it was in pursuing specific sports as a child  or in dreaming about working in fashion as a young adult - I've been told that certain things weren't "for me." I wonder what it would look like if we heard "yes" more than "no" in the pursuit of our dreams? It's all part of why feminism  gender equality  and visibility of marginalized voices and identities are all so important to me. Writing about this and more on my blog  in partnership with Procter & Gamble. http://www.nicolettemason.com/2017/11/to-those-who-believed-in-me-and-to.html

That's kind of how I'm feeling in this hard femme look. As for where I copped these Levi's 711 skinnies - they're from Amazon.com/Fashion! I received a bunch of comments on instagram and twitter that people didn't even know Levi's made plus-sizes  but they do - and they're great.

There's no wrong way to be a woman  no wrong way to be femme  and no wrong way to be queer. So much of impacting social progress and change is in uplifting diverse stories  creating media that promotes visibility  and reflecting our world in a way that emphasizes the value of each of our individual identities and lives. I'm proud to partner with @secret  who embody that message through campaigns like their moving and impactful "Ladies Room" spot  which featured a breakthrough moment of a transwoman  Dana. Thanks to everyone who joined me on my fb livestream to discuss the power of visibility and how we can all strive to be better allies to our lgbtqsiblings!

"NaN". 14 years ago today  June 29th  I got off a red-eye to New York to spend the summer at Parsons  before my senior year of high school. It was also the day of the New York City Pride parade  and after dropping my bags at my dorm  I headed straight for 5th Avenue and the West Village to watch the colorful masses descend upon my adopted hometown. Moving to NYC was a turning point for me; it was the first time and place where I felt like I could be unapologetically myself  where I had the space to explore all the facets of my identity  and where I found my "people." It makes sense that NYC would then be the place where I would start my career  fall in love many times  and share my love and sense of pride in myself with my friends and family. "Pride" exists because having space to be ourselves is not a given for everyone  especially when many of us are told there is something inherently wrong with who we are. Visibility and being "out" is still not safe for everyone  and my greatest wish is that we can work each day to make the world a safer place for everyone to be themselves - whatever that looks like. For me  my personhood and womanhood will forever be attached to the fact that I'm queer  that I'm femme  that I live in this body  that I was born into a mixed family with a multitude of inherited traditions and cultures. This pride season  @Secret is reminding us all that there is No Wrong Way to Be a Woman. This morning  I'll be going live to share my coming out story  all the ways Pride is important to me  and a beautiful spot by Secret that brought me to tears. I hope you will join me! Happy pride  everyone! https://youtu.be/Tjg-ZSk31rw #stresstest #secretpartner #sponsored. 14 years ago today  June 29th  I got off a red-eye to New York to spend the summer at Parsons  before my senior year of high school.

Hope to see you there! 5/19  6-8 PM  Broadway & Broome üòé. One of the best things about spending more time in Los Angeles  these last couple of years  is being closer to my family. I feel so lucky to have parents and a sister who are affirming of me  supportive  unconditionally loving  and kind. My mom has always been one of my biggest role models; being a female engineer  an immigrant  and a woman  she has taught me the value of being independent  hardworking  and resilient in the face of adversity. She's strong  brazen  and opinionated in the best way. Though I'm across the country this Mother's Day  I'm grateful for the privilege to celebrate her any chance that I get - and sending this timeless (like her!) Shinola watch her way as a token of my appreciation and love. Thank you to Shinola for the beautiful new watches to help us celebrate. Momma  I love you! Being your child is a privilege. üíñ If there's someone (a maternal figure  parent  chosen family) that you want to honor this weekend  tag them below and #SayNiceThings.

As an LGBTQ individual  and as a caring and sentient person who believes in welfare and justice for all  I was horrified and disheartened to learn about President 45's rollback on protections for trans and gender-non-conforming students. I hope that you will all read my friend Janet's story below  and join us in the fight to #ProtectTransKids.. I know that I am biased  and I know that my love for Christian Siriano runs deep (after all  we've been friends for the better part of the last decade and he made me feel like a literal princess in the custom gown he created for my wedding)  but I still beam with immense pride after each of his NYFW shows. This Saturday  he presented the most stunning and diversely cast runway show at The Plaza Hotel  and it filled me with emotion  inspiration  and love for not just the clothes  but for the commitment Christian and his team have for making every type of woman see a part of herself reflected  draped in beauty. The collection  the music by Brad Walsh  the venue  the message of love  unity  and intersectionality  are perfect reminders of how important art and creativity are in these times.

Reminding myself of all the things I am capable of accomplishing  the ways my body excels at moving  and the strength I have - both physically and emotionally. Harnessing that strength in small ways each day is an exercise in self-empowerment  and one that feels especially good right now. My workouts might not be "All Day Every Day " but my commitment to my well-being definitely is! Love this reminder on my new Ideology Active workout gear from Macy's. #believeinmovement #ad. Self-care is pretty essential in these times. I'm trying to add in more outdoor activity to my workout routine of barre & spinning  with some beachside jogs  hiking  and all that LA's temperate weather has to offer. Being comfortable and feeling cute while I carve out time to take care of my mind  body  and soul is pretty essential for me! I love these new activewear pieces from Macy's Ideology Active  whether I'm just running errands or taking Frankie out for a walk or hitting the pavement (or sand) for an hour of meditative movement. #BelieveinMovement #ad 

(Shop the collection here: http://macys.com/shop/womens-clothing/ideology-womens-clothing?id=15131). So incredibly grateful for our beautiful subjects and their generosity in sharing their time and their stories  to Refinery29 for giving me a platform for this piece  and to Samantha for taking such stunning portraits of everyone. Bringing intersectionality back to the forefront of the "body diversity" conversation is SO personally important to me  and I could not have done this without help from so many people.

I can't help but imagine what it would mean for any of us who grew up feeling like we were different  like we had to change or conform in order to be loved and accepted  or like we just didn't belong  to see people who looked and identified more like us in our media. It's been a big cornerstone of how I have approached my career and how I push brands to broaden their scope of "diversity" in campaigns and branding. Here's to hoping 2017 can center more conversations like these. <3

I know I can be overly sentimental sometimes (I have a lot of feelings  sorry/not sorry)  but I earnestly have such a committed desire to seeing more diverse  accurate  and honest reflections of our world in the media  and I haven't lost sight of my youthful optimism that those very necessary changes will happen soon. #seethe67 #iworkwithR29.
