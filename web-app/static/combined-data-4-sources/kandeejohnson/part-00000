My typical text reply times:. Let me share with you a story that happened today...I know this seems like it wouldn’t work to most people but when you are sad  cheering someone else up can not only lift their spirits but lift yours too. Now begins what happened at lunch...
The waitress today stood with her arms full of dishes and just looked like all her joy was gone as she looked up at me with  what I could feel was sadness. Even though her eyes seemed sad  they were a beautiful blue and I told myself: “kandee  you need to tell her how pretty her eyes are  she might need it more than you know.” 

As I told her how pretty her eyes were  she almost stood there in frozen shock and she said “oh thank you so much! Thank you!” And then I noticed something I’ve seen many times before. I saw the “tear trail” mark of where a tear has run down her cheek and removed her makeup. She had walked away and Ellie and I both said how she looked like Cinderella. 
When she returned  I told her we thought she looked like a princess. Cinderella to be exact. She told us in surprise  that she used to dress up as Cinderella and had a Cinderella birthday party when she was little. I told her she was so pretty she looked like a model or actress and not to feel just like a waitress. (I have been a waitress while I was in beauty school and my years starting out as a makeup artist. I would day dream of the day I could quit and go after my dreams full time.) 
She said  “You don’t know what that means to me. I’ve had a terrible day and I was crying earlier.” I told her I had tears coming down my face earlier in the day too. And we both shared a moment of both our hearts relating as if to say “it’s ok  you’re not alone”. I told her not to feel alone or bad for crying  and that I hugged and tried to comfort another girl I know that works at a place I go everyday  when I saw her crying in the bathroom  just a day ago too. “You don’t know what this means to me”  she said again with her eyes getting watery  “And now I feel like this is going to make me start crying again” she said with a big smile  watery eyes and a laugh. 

As the check came  I felt God put on my heart a special amount to bless her day with for a tip and I wrote her an encouraging note on the receipt. I know this world is full of hurting people  I know we may be the ones hurting...but I do know that there is a special gift to your heart and exchange of love and care when you give it even when you  yourself are sad. It’s one of the only times when you feel like you have nothing to give...but not only does it flow from you  it fills your heart up with joy knowing you made someone feel happy and cared for too❤️ Sometimes when we’re sad or hurting ourselves  it let’s us relate and be sensitive to others who are hurting too.. When your nails are not looking good but you let them have the upclose shot.... Push through  do not give up  NO MATTER WHAT you are going through...you are getting made stronger each second you push through and that strength will help you push through the next second even STRONGER!. My heart aches and has broken for each of the precious people who's lives were lost yesterday. Tears ran down my face as I looked at their faces. 
My prayer is for heavenly comfort to ease the hearts of their devastated and grieving families and for each person that was at that school yesterday and lived through that horrific day.
The evil in this world and the evil acts that people commit every day  make me sick to my stomach and just heartbroken for all the innocent people who become victims of heinous acts of others.
Our hearts are hurting for these precious victims  for their families and all the people at that school yesterday. We care and wish all our thoughts of love and care could be felt by each hurting person and involved to know....we care  we love you and we stand with you in honor of your precious and treasured loved ones.. ❤️😢My heart is with all those who were at the school in Parkland Florida yesterday. My heart aches for the students who lost their lives  for the parents who are grieving their children and for all those who had to be a part and witness this horrific tragedy. I’m praying for heavenly comfort for them all😢. Happy Valentine’s Day to everyone....and to anyone that didn’t get flowers or chocolate today....may I present you with the world’s biggest bouquet of roses and the world’s biggest chocolate bar...you are loved big time:.

Sadness can creep up on us in the feeling that everyone’s life is better or perfect and yours isn’t. And that is a lie because NOT ONE PERSON’S life is perfect & just great all the time.

BEFORE: is after i took my extensions out  
AFTER: when Dani TyGr and her Artistic powers of corrective cutting and shaping hair like nobody’s business worked her magic!💙. i just started crying in a public bathroom as a song my dad used to play for me came on. It just hits you hard sometimes when you miss someone in heaven. The lyrics in the song say  “There could never be a father that Loves his daughter more than i love u” and my dad used to say that to me...darn it i can barely see through my tears.
If anyone has lost a loved one  know that it's ok to cry  it's actually scientifically proven that crying helps you. And like my grandma always said  "tears water your heart so the rainbows of healing can come out".
I wish I could tell my dad "I miss you so stinkin' much dad  you don't even know!"....
Since I can't  I will decide to keep on living bigger and bolder  and l loving everyone around me even more...in his honor! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzMh7zHir1I.

Share with all your friends that love competition shows whether they have to do with makeup or not!. ⚠️This is NOT something i normally post...
but i have to stand up for what’s right and this made me sick and beyond upset.
🆘Please share this with anyone you know who has children or cares about any children in their life.
❓Please ask if your children watch a guy named Logan Paul (he also had a brother Jake Paul who makes videos with disrespectful behavior & treatment to others) on Youtube - has 15 million followers who are mostly 6-14 years old

😔Logan Paul heartlessly posted a video showing the lifeless body of a person who had hung themself. He zoomed in on their purple hands  zoomed in and commented about his pockets being full  made a heartless joke next to the body and laughed. He then chose to post this online  as well as using the image of the body hanging from a tree his thumbnail to promote the video. There was no regard for the loss of human life  the pain this person had been in  no regard for his family or the young children hoping to be entertained but instead getting the image of a hanging dead body seared into their memory. There was no respect or discernment that this is inappropriate.
💔i don’t wish any ill will to Logan Paul but I️ do want to inform people and parents of who their children might be watching and why they may want to tell their kids not to watch them anymore. 
👬Both brothers have millions of young fans and Jake posts equally disgusting and disrespectful videos like a gross video titled: “Losing My Virginity”with a near pornographic thumbnail image. 

🚫If YouTube isn’t going to protect children on their platform from seeing his videos...
🛑Side note: Many parents  despite trying to see what their kids are watching  may not know the full extent or content hidden in his 15 minute or more vlogs AKA videos of daily life  but in their videos they do extreme  dangerous  and disrespectful things for views.)
...then I️ hope sharing this to let people know Logan Paul (and his brother Jake Paul) 
🚫are not anyone ANY child or even teenager or adult should look up to  be influenced or entertained by.
i feel sorry for Logan Paul...something is very out of balance and sad to be able to post a video of a hanged body and laugh about it  to use that suicide victim’s body heartbreakingly hanging from a tree  as the thumbnail image.
 
😔 ‪Please make sure that you stop any children you know from seeing anymore videos of his. This is not the first disrespectful thing he’s done and sadly i afraid no onecsn be sure what he’ll post next. 
😔i’m sorry kids come to youtube to be entertained and he has 15 million (mostly children) followers that had to witness this. ‬.

When Dwayne The Rock Johnson Retweets You on twitter....you gotta post it on Facebook  for All to see!!!!. Too soon or nah?!?. Huge hugs  love & smiles from me and my babies to you❤️😘 🎄🎁. Today and everyday...let's not think about what's wrong..but let's think about what's right!

That wrong thinking takes just as much energy as it does to think about what's right!

Your heart may be heavy  you might feel like you have more problems than you can figure out...you may feel like you've been praying for something and not getting the answer you want...

(This post was from my blog 7 years  and 7 years ago on Christmas Eve....i got this call. Since then we discovered my sister has Lyme Disease  but she’s doing and feeling great this year) 7 years ago this happened: 

I got an urgent message about my sister being in the emergency room this morning with heart problems. I love my sister so much  she makes me laugh more than anyone  and she has always been the most protective little sister of me. Instantly I wanted to race to her side..but I am hundreds of miles away.  My prayers can be be with her instantly  God's peace can fill her heart with "it's-okay-ness" faster than I can even walk to my car. I just got word from her hubby  that she is doing better  nothing serious  just going for some x-rays. I am so thankful for this news!

I may have problems in my life...but I'm not going to focus on them...I'm going to focus on what's right!

Don't think about:
how you don't have money
how your relationship is not good
how bad things are with your job
how alone you feel
how you wish you'd find Mr or Mrs. Right...
how maybe a loved one is in the hospital or not doing well
You need to focus on what's right...
The tides of change maybe turning as you start thinking differently...
Hope is always the best choice. Choosing to leave those "bad thought" behind you  is right where they need to be...
DON'T LET THE PROBLEMS RULE YOUR FUTURE  LET THEM BE PART OF YOUR YESTERDAY.
Your future is too great to let some problems be rainclouds blocking the sunshine of happiness in your heart!
Say: No problem is going to rule my life or my thoughts....right now I'm choosing to think about what's right in my life...
I surrender all my thoughts to God...and trust that He will fill me with peace...My problems are too big for me to hold on to and try to find a solution...
and the funny and amazing things is...whenever I do that....I do have peace...and I expect good things...and sure enough...the gears start turning...for happiness and peace...and so do I!

Say this with me today:
Oh sure I've got problems  everyone does  but I'm thinking about what I've got right! No problem is gonna take me down. I'm gonna get right back up...and think about the all that's "ALL RIGHT" in my life!

huge love and yay-ness  for waking up today  being alive  and knowing we have the chance to change our future....your kandee
(7 years ago  almost to the day  I wrote this on my blog...and I think these words are still good to hear). Happy Christmas Eve... from lil’ Kandee years ago that got all I asked for: a Swatch watch and a life-size baby doll that smelled like the sweetest (probably toxic) plastic 😂😂😂😂😂😂. Just to put this out there: NO ONE IS HAVING A PERFECT HOLIDAY  despite what everyone’s posts look like on Instagram.

From the girl who was playing makeup scientist in her room at 13  to going to beauty school and realizing I just wanted to be a makeup artist and make people feel beautiful  to being told it was a "pipe dream" and that I should get a "real job"...to starting Youtube to teach everyone who would say "I wish you could teach me how to look like this.."....It is beyond an honor to say I'm a part of this tv show...

I don't just want to share the high moments...I want to share moments that get me down too. I don't want anyone feeling that they are alone feeling discouraged.
I filmed this video before I left for Thanksgiving: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIElFIuzGLI&feature=youtu.be
I had come from shooting a 10 hour day of doing makeup makeovers. I didn't know what was inside a box that was hand delivered while my mom was there. She just said two sweet girls delivered it.
I thought  "oh this will be fun to film opening it  because it's probably something really fun"...
It ended up being the Kylie Cosmetics holiday collection. So I thought I'd just test out and swatch all the products. My camera kept switching focus from me to the background  even though it was set to just focus on me. I couldn't fit me and the swatches in the frame. I just thought it would be fun to upload  so I edited it  uploaded it and it had problems  I took it down  re-edited it until 9pm  but we were supposed to leave on our 8 hour drive at like 3pm. We ended up not getting to our hotel until 2am. I finish uploading it that morning in the hotel...
only to go back and start reading to much hateful comments like: I'm worthless  should die  I suck at editing  I'm a waste of time  I don't know how to edit and on and on and on.
I have been editing poorly for over 8 years now. I never really learned how to edit and back when I started youtube  EVERYONE's videos were't so glossy and great looking like they are now.
I felt really defeated this morning. I tried not to feel hurt as I read through hundreds of comments saying mean things to me. I just want to say thank you to each person that took their precious time to go to youtube  type a kind comment to me. My heart soaked up each word and I want to thank you all for caring about me enough to want to go brighten the comment section with your love.
I sat in tears  reading all your loving words...I cannot thank you enough...please feel all my love in your heart and this hug I wish I could give you in real life. Your kindness makes a difference...it made a difference in my heart and I love you. You are the reason I started making videos...to help  to teach and to inspire. 
There were no youtube famous people when I started  you couldn't make money from youtube...I just wanted to make people feel beautiful  teach things and make you feel like you had an extra friend. Thank you all for being with me for a long time or just from today...I'll always be here to love and encourage you  thank you for encouraging me too  love Kandee

hey guys it's candy and I want to start doing motivational Monday's again so whatever days a week you're watching this that's totally fine but I'm gonna try to upload these on Monday for you guys and comment below or other video topics you would like to see for this below and subscribe if you haven't you've over snapchat Twitter Instagram for life inspirational stuff during the rest of the week too but on Twitter what do you guys asked for a video about how to deal with negative friends this is a huge one because definitely your friends can take your life to really great places and inspire you or they can take you to really negative places and you're not who doing much good with your life and it all can be from having just negative friends around you and how to deal with just negative friends and the whole so I'm going to get into telling guys they say that you become like the five people that you surround yourself with hanging out with the most so this can be scary because if you take a little survey of the five people that you surround yourself with the most are they negative are they inspiring are they doing something good with their life are they making you be a better person are they just bringing fun or joy or love or something to your life if not if your friends are bringing you down being negative making you feel awful maybe not doing things that are inspiring maybe they're doing nothing with their life maybe they're just doing bad things with their life and there's a certain part where you can be around people and be like oh well you know sometimes not all people are perfect not all friends are perfect you know well that is true to an extent but sometimes after a while if those people are still continuing down bad paths or just being negative all the time they're not going to necessarily be helping you go to good places in your life not saying you're better than anyway this is not what this is about at all just saying that I have had friends that are very negative and it started to affect me and my emotions and I started realizing like oh maybe I'm complaining more because all they do is complain about things and maybe I'm being negative and feeling like nothing's ever gonna work because that's what they're also doing and being bitter about other people or people having bad attitudes about certain people and also like I don't like how I feel when you're around and sometimes you just have to distance yourself this is your life and you're guiding it where you want to go so you need to make sure that you're taking care of your life your mind your thoughts and your future this can also be you know I've had friends where I've seen they're hanging around their friends just like to party and are doing nothing with their lives and I can see where my friend has really great opportunities but they're missing out on them because they're just hanging out with their party friends and are doing nothing other than just like in party having fun mode all the time and that can be an area where you need to separate yourself too because you're going to go down that path you want to have friends that are making you feel better making be a better you and having positive friends really can do that especially if you have dreams or goals or things you want to go after and having a negative friend really can work against anything you're trying to do they'll make you feel bad for pursuing good things they'll be really negative about your ideas maybe they're negative about how you dress how you look how you act if they are there making fun of you telling you bad things that is not a friend and immediately you need to remove that person from your life whatever it is just distance yourself don't talk to them or you if you feel like you need to tell Mike hey I feel like you're being really negative it's probably not going to get a good response we're gonna be like no I'm not or it's probably just gonna be a negative situation so it's best just to slowly distance yourself from that and I've had to do that from friends in my life where I felt so much better once I wasn't around their negativity and that bad energy all the time just making me feel like oh the world is such a helpful place maybe uh awful maybe everybody available you need to be around positive people so I say make sure that you surround yourself with positive people be or be around people that you like how they treat people they're kind they're accepting they're open they're fun they're happy they're not putting other people down they're not putting you down they're not putting your dreams down and that you want to be around people to inspire you with what they're doing with their life do they have dreams and goals they're going after you almost like I'm not gonna do anything I'm just gonna do nothing with my leg because nothing is worth doing anything for that is not great after a while you can encourage them and you can be in source of inspirations to them and then once you realize it's not working they're just being negative and dragging your life down it's time to find a whole new sphere it doesn't matter because who has five people around maybe people have five people usually people have like one friend so if you have the one friend you're like that's the only friend of that it does matter because it's better to be alone and work on going to a positive place than it is to have one negative friend pulling your life down so that is my inspiration for the day I hope it helped one of you guys out if you feel that it did and you feel somebody could use this share this video wherever you want and make sure that you guys follow me on twitter all over those places twitter facebook snapchat okay Instagram Instagram just

I needed have a problem I think right now the first thing we're going to do you know a lot of our hair with her lovely liquor tools now we are going to college I really am I kind of liquid tool with an essential tool it is an essential tool should I be using that side round brush that's wavered in my side Rob rush so what specifically rolls on with a larger round brush can be more smoothness with Mahler diameter round brush is going to be more program are we doing a center part we are doing I never center part my hair so this will be a unique viewing experience for all of you out there and the reason we're doing the center part is for our final project okay I'm going to try to leave this venture car trip I feel like my face is like a lollipop with a centerfire but I'm going to trust you trust me because your professional hair person I wasn't doing here I didn't look good okay journalist Alice Cooper perimeter and all the dark more expensive we do externality for life the views and whatnot but nobody exactly developments in here but like it I put in stuff sometimes on my hair when I don't have a hair bottom so those are our girls he just got it great minds think alike this is really weird I have never in my life I'm not even doing you ever like my hair like this one time I got photos taken with it and I was like oh I'm so broken who are your round face and I need one more moon morning was not nearly enough food a lot of this blue quartet because not all new stars really go oh wait thank you i buy the wrote about it is that i saw more use the MOR performance is really like these other boosters I think it's degree or some ways a nerf gallon right and this was another way the hair down the more on you skin the more Oh like it you just get the volume by regular rolling under in the back or the other trick for that feel so is the more you push the hair up towards the ceiling if we go straight up we're going to get more volume than if we were just glowing about 12 here if you go forward with that you get the roots going mr. Hobbs and since they fall back he is bigger even more the higher the hair the more forward we go I'm never going to siding down ever and get me your feeling of you here oh my god you just got that solo oh my gosh that is can you make you decide look at this look II need a before and after head like I didn't know me before like your floppy fatty bed and then look at this volume is crazy oh my god now we are going to study this with a little better clip so control explain to me all right we have our dusty Shea Parker's right he said the hairspray on first and the hairspray on first going to use a one rather than a curly man so when you will remember what Roman is married to a Cylon it's a little dated high school and kind of terrible days actually works okay that's it that's it so what hair essentially when you add heat to it it's like wet cement so cool this is hotter instead the cools in that shape is literally it's not hard into the block employed because the krogan of last much longer like for the top and bottom yet what we miss like my same high last series mess here on the top and the bottom of my underneath wrapping so with a 1 what it's going to do again we're giving a little bit of a modern twist to the right you know iconic look you know traditionally the curling iron when you wrap it the curls stays flat you know that if I pick Shirley Temple yeah perfectly like yeah yeah yeah yeah so that happens with the curling iron with the wand but when you wrap the hair around it the hair is twisting at the same time that you're wrapping it around once ah what happened is even softer curl out of it so curling iron Shirley Temple Brooke wand curls without literally symbol ringlet curls of the ring we all look like Ellen as Professor John Silver's for just stays in like that and of course you can get up to that route the more you're going to get a little more bottom line but if I want to be really fashion forward elegantly friend one day people are going to oiled in here like this acknowledged you think we need in moral direction moral reform Harlan Moo's mooing a big mistake a lot of people make is they don't prepare their hair well when they're visiting oval I'm just going to curl it I'm just going to slide Ernest W all the work for me then again this because it makes a difference when you take that extra step and you know it didn't take very long yeah for that little blow-drying eating with your constant driving for the world loop in the dark oil and eulogize out really really quick like a minute Botox yes just the whole reflection five-minute blow-dryer depending on how much hair you have yeah but you're going to get that smooth program well bringing that sleek smooth shiny finish and we're gonna let that the lab is cool for a couple of minutes it was really lucky and stuff if they're not ready at all I'm sorry you're going to be music videos and then we wearing your hair like this anyone can do this she predicted it so now my hair is all cooled down now what do we do now so glad we're going to take out all these clips I feel you mean this is not shirley temple at all and look like an enemy character right now so for shame to see another one was relaxing videos is watching curls get brushed out what do you want to park outside out start from the top of it and all right all the way down I just alleged land reform and amenities in front of my manatee right well as long is my fantasy brush so now if you want to get a little extra smoothness and shine yeah a little more dark oil I'm going to feel like you ever play right in my hair done done right really really soft brush a little bit dark oil is actually with the dark oil again because it is very hot yeah I'm turn back yeah and you can seems like the texture of it it's a little bit or yeah not only is is almost like honey or me yeah yeah yeah from the roots fingertips and work down through the other oh my god that's not so good whenever I use dark oil on dry hair I'm going to apply this and we'll work it in oh my god look at how cool it make it look committee route all the way down through you know I can get that same curl pattern all the curls

I seriously put this thing away before I hurt myself hi guys it's candy and as you can see I don't have any liner or mascara on this eye because I'm going to show you guys how to master the basic winged eyeliner like a pro if you haven't subscribed to me do it right now like this video if you want to see more makeup basics like a pro this isn't crazy complicated just super easy because this even scares the most famous celebrity makeup artists that are my friends if somebody's not telling you they're still a little scared to a winged eyeliner sometimes they're not being real with you so I'm going to show you guys how to master it I've seen so many tips from using a spoon to taping your face - pretty sure I hope they were joking with a knife but I'm gonna show you guys how just to do doing liner window game is no gadgets no weapon no knives no tape no utensils nothing I'm gonna show you how to do it and you're like comment below what other makeup base if you would like to master like a pro let's get started here we go all you want to do first is make sure that you put in eye primer or I just like to use concealer then you want to set that with powder then you want to go ahead and do your regular eye shadow like normal you need the eyelid to be dry with a powder or an eye shadow if you don't it's just going to melt off and smear the pigment in the liquid eyeliner they can't adhere if there's oil on the lid it needs to be dried with the eyeshadow or at least powder on your face so let's go to the bathroom and I will show you how to do this okay so the first thing that I need to tell you is you want to use a felt tip eyeliner this is my favorite right now it's the TARDIS from Tarte you can use any felt tip eyeliner that you want the trick is that you want a felt tip liner that's very pointed and firm the brushes can get really wobbly and sometimes gel liner is a little trickier to master there are great drugstore options too so anything that looks like this go ahead and give it a try okay a very important tip is when you go to do this you don't want to just come with this handle floaty around all crazy that's going to give you wiggly lines for sure you need to have like a fulcrum point or somewhere where this is still against your face and then this is going to move in this direction so for me this is this is how I would put it on so I put like this this hand near my chin or resting on my chin or however and then this hand is against there to hold it still it's not touching my face so it can move if you do this on your face you're limiting your movement and it's going to be really weird so I do it here and then this guy like I'm rest like I'm doing this and then I put him on top to hold him steady and then same thing when you do your wing just move him up your jaw line or wherever hold this steady and then lean your hand on here so you have like a range of movement if you do it here you can't get you can't get good angles this way so you want to hold your hand here and then you do that on top that's what's going to give you this whole new skill otherwise this floating this is going to give you Wiggly right there and also if you're working on a client what you want to do is this is different when you're on a client you can do different angles and be close it's the same as like a hairdresser can blow-dry your hair different than you can you just need different angles so you want to put one of those powder puffs on your hand slip your fingers in it so it's not against their face and then you you do your angles this way when you're on their face it's different than when it's on your own face the angle is totally different so quiet you can do here with the powder puff like this you you're going to do cutesy posing from a picture and then you're going to do your wing liner like so okay so I like to take the tip of my brush and I lay him down sideways I'm not going in on the tip and drawing like this I'm laying it flat up against my skin so I lay him down here right at the midpoint of the eye and you want to make sure that you're looking straight on if you're doing it down or too far back your line and wing is going to get really weird-looking so I lay him down flat right there and then I just go to the outer corner go down like this and then you really want to make sure that you fill in the lashline if there's any gaps where you see your skin that gets weird smooth out this line and a little back against the lash line then again I'm going to lay him down I'm just going to lay it right down and I kind of pushing it down onto like my lashes and you're like stamping that down and then connecting it and then you want to go to the inner corner and I'm just going to lay it down even more I'm not drawing with the tip I'm using the whole side of the brush just pushing it against my skin so you push and then go in the direction but you're pushing it against and drag not just with the tip but the whole side of the felt then you want to go in the inner corner of the lash line so for this part I pull the eye to the side and then you really want to get down almost like you're going towards the inner waterline inside there so you get like a really nice transition and then you can just smooth out any wobbles then when I assumed out the wobbles that's when I go back in with just the tip and I really work on the edge of smoothing out any wobbles so once you get this amid the main part is just getting it from here to here and you can make this as thick as you want over here once you have your wing established then you can decide how thick you want it but this is the basic shape and you want to stop right about the corner where your eyelashes stop the corner of your eye if you go down too far then your wings gonna come down real low and be weird so just stop right at like the corner the skin where that like is the corner of your outer eye right there okay now we're going to do the outer wing part so where you see here on the under curve of your eye this is where you typically want your wing to continue up so just remind imagine if there was a line here and this just curving upward if it if this just kept curving upward like this that's where you want your wing if you like your wing up higher anywhere else you can adjust it but that's typically where you want your wing liner to continue so you just kind of have to eyeball and guess it so I start here down at the end where I stopped my liner and then I'm just going to go up and just little light strokes and I don't do the full wing I just do little light strokes like I'm going up in that direction then I reverse where the direction I'm going and then I connect him where I stop that point and I connect him down here to the top and then just go back and smooth him out if there's a wall anywhere just keep smoothing it out and connecting it and are going to fill this in a little more I'm going to make him a little more pointed so I drag him back this way so I get this point really nice and then under here is all wobbly so I got to go ahead and fix him now this is going to be your special trick you take an angled brush and any matte black eyeshadow and since I don't like having shiny black liner or any wobbly lines you take the black eyeshadow and you go right over where you did your winged liner can you go right on the part on the edge where your skin and the eyeliner met and you just gently blur any wobbly lines or any Wiggles that you may have had and it makes your eyeliner matte and it helps kind of hide any little wiggling guide you may have gotten so it's not so scary you guys can totally do it if you mess up what you want to do is take a little bit I make a room for on a q-tip gently fix or wipe off the smudge put a little bit more concealer powder your eyeshadow so it looks like nothing ever happened and start over again it's just makeup just eyeliner if you don't get it just wipe it off I'm going to go ahead and um put my mascara on so we're gonna curl my lashes um in high school is when I started wearing a liquid eyeliner and it was like Wiggly and wobbly like a lot of the times or they'd be like my wings would be like doing like a wave they were just like not symmetrical at all but just keep practicing and that's how you get better and better and better let me put this on and I'll come right back so you can see the finished result so that was it guys piece of cake now you can be a winged liner master just practice if you mess up just wipe it off and start all over again so make sure you guys subscribe comment below whatever whatever well of a makeup base that you want to see um below so I know what to make for you guys but the winged liner once you master this you can smoke it out smudge it out you can do all kinds of things but a winged liner in a red lip classic lip Marilyn Monroe from the 50s up until now it's still a classic look now you can do we're to

during the holidays not trying to get sad or anything for anybody but a lot of the friends I have are dealing through heartbreaking situation right now and I want you guys to know that even though it's the holidays you don't want to mark this with remembering the holidays for that time you want to have a fresh start and think anew and if you're feeling depressed you feel lonely or overwhelmed know that this is just one holiday it's not all the holidays forever if this one isn't going right or feels horrible it's okay you get one every year a new chance to start over and if you're feeling lonely you have no idea that this time next year you may feel more love and full of life and people around you than you've ever felt before don't ever lose hope I've had some of these loneliest Christmases where I've been alone and not had money and I just put a little piece of paper cutting a triangle up on the wall my apartment and I knew that this was going to be part of my success story that i would tell later that could help cheer somebody up that this wasn't going to be all my Christmases I was ever gonna have this is just gonna be one that grew my strength and grew my heart to know that it's okay and I will make it through anything that's going I want you guys to know too that I know depression is a huge issue something I cannot tackle in this video alone I want you to know that I'm loving you I'm praying for you I would be sending you so many hugs and squeezing you and if I could fit everybody that's sad and lonely into my house for Christmas I would totally do it because I've had those lonely Christmases where I was crying and feeling so alone and depressed know that I love you and I'm sitting you so many hugs to cheer you on and remember go back to celebrating a little small things next you gotta think thankfully this is a mindset and a change that will totally change your life and not to get all snappy and crazy and cliche but really if you start off the day with all the things that you're thankful for you will realize just that you can see just that you're not in a hospital dying just that you're alive I am thankful that I have food to eat in my refrigerator because there was a time when I didn't and I'm not saying that to be a sad sob story I'm just saying it gives me a new appreciation and gratitude for things that a lot of people overlook and I just want you guys to practice being just thinking thankfully everywhere you go thankful for your friends thankfully you got a car thank for the you of bed to sleep in and if you don't have a legacy be thankful that you got a heart that's pumping and you have legs that are walking and moving you so just start thinking thankfully and watch how it changes everything then you can always start new traditions so if you have traditions or memories built up with a loved one or family that's moved away or gone or friends know what now can't no can't do those traditional yeah or maybe you don't have any traditions at all interlocked ward your Christmas traditions you're like I don't know how many now it is time you can make those traditions make a special choc chocolate

I save this one for last is kind of a big one kind of a doozy kind of a heavy hitter I don't want to depress anybody or make them sad but this is something I know so many of you guys are dealing with um it's how to celebrate Christmas or holidays when you lost someone that you love and if you guys don't know my dad was killed a couple years ago in a crazy accident a few arns before he was supposed to pick me up from the airport and that Christmas was hard i did want to decorate do you want to celebrate do you want to do anything like I didn't want to have a Christmas without him um one thing that I realized that I needed to turn around in my thought was that I needed to celebrate in his honor I wanted to make I went from not lying to put a christmas tree up to say i'm gonna make a christmas tree so festive and amazing my dad will be so proud I hope it sparkles to heaven and okay I did not mean to cry at all but I want you guys to make those changes live bigger live Boulder Liv more amazing in honor of the ones that you've lost they would not want you to be sad and shrink down and not live life and not have joy and not find happiness those are the things that they want those

going to be the most amazing and you're gonna live it the biggest most decorated most fun most filled with joy with all of them in the details celebrating them and just making them proud from Earth up to heaven and finally we're going to end on a happy note this is number seven this is fine something to laugh over this is something so huge that we need to laugh it releases so much and again I will

I can't even open my eyes hi guys it's candy and today I am reviewing magnetic eyelashes not only did one of my good friends but my sister and my mother text me about the magnetic lashes and if they work I was like yeah dukes I have not tried them I should try them for you all so let's get started are you ready for trying our magnetic eyelashes so I went straight to the Internet to order a few pairs so I ordered these from 1to lash I also ordered two pairs from Amazon so this is what I got the Aurora acts women's new thin 4 millimeter bla bla bla I also ordered these they're cheaper so they're probably gonna be worse [Music] I've read the directions several times and I'm gonna try to put them on and tell you what do we think and how they look compared to the actual real glue on lashes that I normally do where my first time ever putting lon I did not practice I want to be just as new at trying this as you guys these are from one to lash these work here ready $69 but you do get two pairs so they come in this magnetic case and then you get the top and the bottom the bottom is marked with a red dot and we put him I guess right underneath it's stuck on there but it feels weird like I didn't get it down low enough so we're just gonna try it again I don't know how you remove it I just pulled them off the lashes okay we're gonna try it again I'm putting this guy right there on top I have him placed where I want him perfectly now we've got so the magnet on the top guy it's gonna go on my lash like this the magnet is on this side then the bottom guy is on the total opposite side okay I mean I guess they stick together like this okay this is the deal they don't perfectly line up do you see one is like staggered over to the side is this right okay so he would go on the top this is like a little more tricky we put him on the top okay and people might be wondering like why would you use magnetic lashes a lot of people have different medical reasons they can't use the glue near their lashes or anything like that maybe they have latex allergies could be many many things so this is a good alternative and glue gets blobby and gross you snap on to your little friend there it's really hard to get the bottom to get close to the lashes before he magnetizes it definitely is a little bit of a learning curve here so we're gonna try this just get on my eye you stay there and then you're gonna go underneath buddy and you're gonna go near my lash line on if I were come around Dada look at the magnetic eyelash now let's try to do this eye it feels a little bit heavier than normal lashes maybe I'll get used to it like you know when you first put lashes on it feels like your eyelashes weigh like 80 pounds now turn over my eyes so I'm gonna try it and maybe you'll get used to it okay so now let's do the top right now that I'm a pro because I did that one eye five million times we're gonna put him there you stay there you just trust that that guy's gonna stay there and then we get the bottom guys and then this is a tricky part so you open Arobin okay I feel him Wow okay so there's this both of our lashes on even if you did terrible wind guyliner you just put these on and it looks like you have perfect winged eyeliner okay so what I will tell you so far pros I like that they definitely don't stick on your skin so you won't have that like mistake a lot of people make of like gluing the lash on to the skin and it's too high when it should be glued to the base where the lashes come out like on the lash is not so much on the skin sometimes so this eliminates that because it literally just clips them down on to the eye lashes themselves I mean they feel really good they're not is like I would want to trim these it seems like they have a little bit of a jagged edge here which I maybe as my applicator error is the problem that we've got going on so I don't know why I did that like a shake test like I was gonna shake them off let me try brushing them and see if that moves them around like what if your eyelashes just got brushed I mean I'm much more impressed I was really thinking these are gonna be terrible and I'm gonna hate them and they're never gonna work but if I do this they don't seem to come off look what if somebody like hugged you and bent your lashes I'm just gonna push on them we're gonna pull them and push on my eyelid like so what if I brush them with a powder brush would you stay on do you come off I mean no one's gonna do that with regular mascara but I'm pretty impressed overall I'm pretty impressed now let's see the proper removal do I just I don't know I just peel them off like I peel off normal washes and you can see the different wrongs I mean I'm actually really really impressed with these I was thinking these were going to be terrible gimmick horrible idea and I actually think the magnetic lashes worked pretty well I can't speak for all that I don't know there could be other magnetic lashes that don't work as well [Music] this was the cheap Amazon one the quality of these is already like kind of much more terrible so when I pulled the lashes off they're curled very weird where the other more expensive ones were definitely like more higher-quality let me show you here so I don't know if you can see the magnet is already coming off of the lash and I just opened them I haven't even worn them yet so these cheap four dollar ones are absolutely terrible these ones the lashes aren't magnetized in the packet like this one they're glued on I don't know if you can see this but look at the lashes already bent out weird to the side like he already looks like something's wrong with him so I guess you get what you pay for I'm gonna try to put one on just so you can we can compare there also wasn't an indication of what is the top or the bottom lash so I'm just gonna guess oh my gosh this magnet is like totally coming off that's not even gonna work are you kidding me they put the magnets they're all on the wrong side so these pretty much look like all the bottom lashes there's no magnet on the opposite side to make them sandwich together so I don't know who thought of this cuz this one the magnet is gonna stick underneath your eye I think somebody just tried to make a bunch of cheap knockoffs of the expensive one I want to try to put him on okay I set him on there and I don't know how I'm gonna get this bottom one to stick I'll try to put him on but this is gonna stick out below your eye oh my gosh these are terrible these cheap ones can you see you can see the magnet underneath my eye that not only looks terrible but it feels horrible okay no wonder the box of this one to lash said there's lots of imitators but they cannot replicate it I guess they have patent a patent design these look a million times better than these cheap ones I got from Amazon oh my gosh can I just show you how terrible this one already looks look at how bit the cheap one already it's horrible no wonder you work for dollars or six dollars you're absolute worthless I like throwing my money away I can't believe this one magnet is literally already coming off look at this the magnet is already coming off of the lashes you cheap junk you get what you pay for his lid doesn't even close the lid doesn't even close these are terrible do not buy those look at the packaging they've already magnetized together in one big clumpy ball unlike these that have like individual magnetized tray these are so terrible I never write negative reviews online I almost want to go do one just so none of you accidentally go and spend your money on this so in this case you do get what you pay for $6.00 was like thrown into the trash because that was garbage and these these were more money but they were definitely worth it because they are much better quality and I did there's not even comparison these are like I just throw those in the trash room you care [Music]

kind of finish in essence I know that I'll tell you that about two so the first one the color I had to have in the collection was a white on my cam down we got to have a white color in there I loved white on nails since I was like in high school I think it just looks modern and it looks fresh and it looks chic so this color either like the white out white there's like a gold pearl essence in it so when you see it in a bottle doing me like hey it was like a gold pearl this is a flat white well it is because the excess is there just to give it like a luxurious texture so it doesn't look like flat and so when it's on the nails it just looks like white matte but you'll see the gold to essence because only luxury for you guys I named it with frosting because I wanted to look like whipped frosting on your singing ticket plus is the name like candy I wanted all the names to kind of sound like yummy edible trees so this is what frosting the next coat I wanted this is called strawberry milk it is the perfect pale pink you guys we rework this in the lab so many times to get it to the perfect shape for things like that's too cool that's too warm that's too dark let's do this finally we got it to the perfect pink shade as you can see animals or even pink because I want it so this I have the white nail polish I had just got my hair done I washed my hair the pink dye for my hair stain my white nail polish the most perfect light peach shade and everybody's asking what it was everywhere when they're like what is that pink shade what is that color what is your nail polish and although you guys we have to make this pink shade that my nails are right now and I like it's the color of strawberry milk so we got the perfect shade of strawberry milk so you strawberry milkshake brings all the boys to the yard okay I'll stop sing the song but strawberry milk it you're going to love this color then the next this is called pinup paint and this is actually the color of my nails right now I have pinup ink and then I have strawberry milk up there with the nail design near the cuticle and that gold is going to premiere my collection is coming out in February so all of the

of my sister Tiffany it's kind of like tiffany blue tiffany bluish matisse greenish also but her favorite ice cream growing up with midships Oh sister business Brio my favorite color is named after you Mitchell I love this color next this is like a really fun one so this is called confetti it's like a mix of candy and confetti camera so this has all the different pieces I think there's turquoise glitter there's a minty green glitter there's a pink glitter there's like an iridescent holographic shimmer in there and this on top of any of these colors you put it on top of the pink you put it on

and I love it so this is Ken Fetty this can be hearts color I love this color this is like the perfect baby blue this reminded me of the Queen of Hearts video I did with the blue and I was like I love it and then I thought of the little Valentine's hearts you know to say like I love you kiss me miss me all those kind of things like we have to name a candy hearts so kind of Queen of Hearts in candy hearts together made this perfect blue shape again we reworked it so many times to get this perfect light blue shade and then I also love him like these two together with the gold is coming out I'm

stinkin cute I love this so those are fun and then we also had to get a black I wanted a matte black and it's not super flat and boring like a like some black nail polishes might seem really flat it also has those gold pearl essences that you don't see the pearl it but it just gives us this beautiful essence in the finish that gives it more luxury look to the flat blackness so this I named liquorice then this is so cool so this is a peach and it's called peaches and cream so I want to tell you guys like I sent in like images of everything that I love I love this shoe so much I also had

ah yes once upon a time in the Great Library we looked for a special book ah bereit hee hee old photos of candy somewhere within the pages of this book like the photos of Candy's makeup in high school oh no this is far too early on in life Archie's topless don't look at that photo inappropriate oh yes she's still too young here but she's freshly tied a bandana around her waist with a tennis shoe purse Oh yep this looks like she would be very young if she were in high school this doesn't look like she's in high school looks like she's with a Care Bear ok we're getting closer not in high school look at the size of my eyebrows look at the size of my eyebrows I'm going to show you one of my high school pictures look at the size of my eyebrows do you see eyebrows they are ginormous here we were at my cousin's wedding that is my sister my mom my aunt Sharon me and my grandma this was my cousin Shari getting married this was me making spaces as a wedding with my really thin eyebrows here I was with my super long hair in my pajamas I got this cool candle which I kept for years which I like look at how long my hair my hair was like Rapunzel this is like after the first time I got had been twins I think so they're looking better dance this is me after they cut off like a foot of my hair and I was like traumatized I loved these white boots and these knee-high socks I would wear those like all the time I love these boots I got them at the store I worked out and I would wear them like all the time and then I picked you so - look at the eyebrows look at the eyebrows I have going on this I never really wore the dark lip what I did that day look at my little big boost this here was candy look at I did nose contouring back and that wasn't a thing but I did it look at how long my hair was my hair was like Rapunzel this was like after the first time I eyed Ross had been tweezed I think so they're looking better there and then I was really a fan of the nude lip so I have all these looks I look like four totally different people I went to the drugstore and I went and I bought a bunch of today and I was trying to understand exacting and they don't make a lot of the products some they did and I was so excited about it so I didn't really wear foundation back then so I used Coney powder and I couldn't find the Kody powder anywhere so I'm going to try to make this I love this I just wear this on a daily basis when I want to look like I have no makeup on but my skin looks perfect so this is the body ground the skin foundation so I'm going to put that on all over my fingers I'm just going to use my fingers because there were not beauty blenders or things like that back then but this is going to help I think I made a warn what a covergirl foundation but I don't remember wearing foundation I just already put that coating powder on because my grandma used and I felt like that's what you had to use this if you're grabbing is it meant for whores but four year old on so I'm just going to put this all on here I'm not even using a mirror what am i doing and going back to legs before there was even time of years I had two drawer in the middle of my dress or my pot dresser that I cleared out and I would put like all of my my makeup things in there which is like not a lot of products but what I did have you know I pull up in that drawer Icarian seat why did I get in here when I started this what am i doing oh there we go there I am yes this looks like this looks like my high school skin I guess my skin was like less freckly this is pretty much exactly what my high school skin looked at look like more even there we go boom we're done ah okay so we're totally not done then I use that Cody powder which I don't know I think they still make it I think I so I'm just going to use my Laura Mercier powder and I'm just going to set my face because that's what I did it apparently just with the powder I know when I first started my makeup my mom let's lose right before freshman year like me when I was in middle school my mom would let me wear makeup but she only let me wear clear mascara and I was pissed doesn't even look like anything looks like my eyelashes are just wet like this something to make them look better so that's what that's your mascara on everyday and then I put my frosted pink they have like covergirl made these little like lipstick tubes and frosty pink and frosted white all it's all about the frost I've had the frosty light and frosty pink I don't even think I actually put eyeshadow on I think I just put like powder on my eyelid was all that I did so boom we're already done the fastness then this is where it gets interesting because I love me some liquid eyeliner but nobody was doing wings back then like wings were not a thing and I think this is a version of what I use Deloria then nail in bins with a brush tip because anal liquid liners Afghans had felt it it was all like a brush like a wobbly terrible brush but you were pinstriping a car and I remember I had like swimming first period and PE and I'd be like I just put my eyeliner this morning to the bus ride the specialty part of this is I just there was no wing I would just go to like right there so I'm an attempt yet this is the same brush same wobbly wobbly rushes we're going to try and I would start in the middle a member that would start in the middle and I was come down to the end very close to my lash and so just like that and then I would kind of inch it along right up towards when I left it started to grow and I wouldn't go all the way to the corner I would just say that we go to like where my lashes started I don't know why I have no idea I should do this in for you guys whoop wrong way so then we'll do this other side which again I start the middle look already messing up and then hold just going yeah yeah right there yep that's right about where I'd start or I do it right in the inner part of my eye like right there that's pretty much exactly what my eyeliner was like kind of are you in there I know and then for mascara I give you sometimes like news L'Oreal which is all a divine but I did use the Max Factor I think was the Max Factor 2000 calorie mascara I know that I use that like for years and use that for years after high school as a makeup artist I love that stuff I couldn't find a Mac factor as a dresser and a quick point of pony powder it has the manager I look what you did I'm trying to find and then I would put you know my mascara I used to do a little trip back then which I thought was so brilliant I would pay where's my little wedge sponge I would take my little white sponge and I would dust powder onto my lap is like that I would like push it up on my last year so the whole underside of my lockers were like powdery white and then I would put the mascara on there to make them thicker I know I did that I was trying to do a little trick all along his life there weren't urgency because to want to make up success in so you either made stuff up or you just made a mess and this I know for a fact was one of mine and many other people's favorite I know because it was number six six six now like that is the devil's number I should not be buying this Oh using lip liner back then I'll low it's a lip liner yeah Alex dollar and eyeliner lip it's crazy because I also had this lip color from Clinique it was in a little pot and I think it was called the rose gold and that was like one my first fancy like departments RNA that's was their rhythms old put me I wear that a lot it was much darker than the nude okay so and then we're going to use one of our shop so I look through this frosty with stick so I'm gonna put this on it makes me happy that that one while this liner is still around because I'm I'm just don't make it so I'm gonna use this pink bras of course I love me something for us yet this is like the color outerwear uh-huh oh yeah this is great together your lip liner so that your lips looks big and full yes but Wafi alright yes I'm going to put some of this Rose porky color just because I love the frost don't watch we're gonna get full for off the fact oh yeah s stuff next across the tree all about it read my lips to read all about it I thought I got ready like this one caller did yeah this is my go-to makeup I yeah and I didn't ever do anything to my brows I did let me show you guys who is the pitcher go okay I want I did nose contouring I've never liked my nose at all like a I've never liked my nose until so I've never liked my nose and I would no contouring was not a thing when I was in high school let me tell you it was not it did not exist nobody was doing it this is gonna be for Kim Kardashian was doing her contouring but located Johnson was up there Chris your nose okay look in from a baby candy space look at the nose contouring look at that crazy contouring I did like my eyeshadow this is not something I did every day but some days I did it apparently this day look at that what was I doing it's so drastic looking look at that nose contouring it was like so it was just like embarrassing that I did this back then close your look Andy oh my gosh our look is not complete I'm gonna go get my brown haired wig and see how much I can look like old high school candy ha on the back and cut off this is total highschool candy this is so weird because when I look in the mirror I'm like this is flashbacks of how you did do a little barely eyeliner how you did your frosty lip and my eyebrows looks way better now it's now roving high school Sam used to be a Bacon's not good box off with a smokey eye and I was here just proud that my liner wasn't totally with me and crazy I don't know I can't feel what I like here like this what do

Oh everyday millions of people from around the globe are suffering from w AI D w bi ki mmm Oh what am I doing wrong before I put my makeup on syndrome I'm here to give you 60 steps that you need to do every day before you put your makeup on that will give you perfect looking skin let's put in 2 WD w VIP mmm oh hi guys it's candy and today I am here with 6 things that you might be doing wrong or might not even be doing before you put your makeup on number one you probably grab your phone to look up a makeup inspiration fix or even change the music you're listening to while you do your makeup but studies show that cellphones have 10 times more bacteria than public toilet seats you want to make sure that you wash your hands after you touch your phone and before you touch your face otherwise that's a surefire recipe to spread the bacteria that's going to turn into breakout zits or who knows what on your face wash your face yes this may seem pretty basic unless you've taken a shower if you say shower at night wake up in the morning you want to make sure that you wash your face you want to remove all the debris allergens and oil that have collected on your face because those will get trapped beneath the makeup and cause more breakouts and washing is great for the surface removal but you want to use an exfoliator to really get down slop off the dead skin cells get in the pores and clean out all that debris and junk that could be left over from your makeup this is going to give you the softest clear skin and make your makeup look even more flawless I have used an exfoliator since I was a teenager and started washing my face and I really think this is a key to help keeping my skin really clear and if you haven't seen my lemon sugar scrub video it may revolutionize your face I'll put a link for it down below hyaluronic acid is one of the most incredible anti-aging properties it hydrates and plumps up the skin even for oily sensitive or breakout prone skin one gram of hyaluronic acid can hold up to six litres of water this is especially great for any areas that you want to plump up turn any raisin like areas into a plum full grape like area it is so important to moisturize your skin you guys even if you have oily skin moisturizing is what you need to prime the canvas before you put your makeup on it's going to make your makeup go on smoother look flawless look more plump and perfect all day long this is a trick that makeup artists always do it's moisturize and plump the skin I'm using the Khaliq dramatically different moisturizing lotion you guys may or may not know I partnered with comida because I raved about their foundation but I also got a sample of this dramatically different lotion when I first bought the foundation and I used at night the very next day I could not believe how my skin looked like a baby skin if you just have to try it but make sure that you guys always moisturize this is lightweight it absorbs into skin quickly and it's really affordable this is only 1450 I love bargains if you guys can watch my snapchat you've seen me using this taking it on trip everywhere I love this stuff I cannot tell you how important most arises are either also going to help in the anti-aging process and give you perfect looking skin just moisturize moisturize moisturize and don't forget to moisturize your lips you want to make sure you apply lip balm so your lips don't get dry crackling or peeling especially if you're wearing a liquid lipstick and if you can let all your moisturizers and your plumping products work for 15 minutes before you put your makeup on that is best so I use this time to blow-dry or pick out my outfit then the last thing before you get started your beauty tools makeup sponges and brushes can get really dirty and harbor bacteria and cause more breakouts of acne and blemishes so you want to take your cleanser this is just a vegan brush shampoo you can use this or just a regular bar soap scrub it around get it really good and covered and then you're going to rinse and wring it in the water and repeat this several times until your Beauty Blender looks brand-spanking-new look at this this is so rewarding I love watching the foundation and also spills come out of my Beauty Blender looking good as new just like when I first opened her from the packaging and we can't leave out our brushes anytime you have some dark colors or maybe you did a crazy turquoise eye who knows you want your brushes all clean I'm just taking some Beauty so clean I love it because it's free of all kinds of harsh chemicals that are in a lot of other brush cleaners and you swirled around on your paper towel to see no more traces of eyeshadow and your brush is all clean sanitized dry and ready to go and now come with me if you will as I put the rest of my makeup and we see how it comes out after I've done all these steps [Music] [Music] so that is it guys you follow those steps beep or you even start to put your makeup on and your makeup will come out looking even more perfect your skin will look smoother and plumper and softer and your lips will also look smooth and plump even when you put a liquid lip on they won't look dry and crackly and I have to say I'm pretty impressed at how dewy and fabulous what skin is looking after I did all those things I hope you don't like it comment below what was your favorite thing that you learn from this video and forestland get to know me question of the day so we can know each other a little bit better would be what is your favorite candy bar I think mine is probably a KitKat that's what I'm gonna go with you guys comment what you are in this week stress on that snapchat Twitter Instagram Facebook all the places snapchat friends my favorite thing right now who would have tried to do this crap story and let me know if this helped you guys with your makeup and I will see you guys in the next video so it's all times right our room left around it does alone from me to you tonight in the next video bye 
lucky and I got presents for you so see you later sorry they get to make it today bye for now hi guys it's candy and today I want to make a really special video for you guys not me like a sad crying video I really want this to empower you guys give you strength and give you some tools to handle um if there has been a loss of a loved one in your life and then I'm gonna get into the story of how I lost my dad after that um this is just something and everybody grieves the thing differently they handle loss and grief totally different these are just five things that I think could help I hope that they will help you also so the first thing number one would be to cry you have to get it out you have to let that out there's a different chemical composition in the actual make up of a tear that comes from sadness versus a tear that comes from joy and it actually does release things that will make you feel better after you cry I know a lot of people will do things to suppress or numb the pain you have to go through grief just like when a mom goes through child labor she can't say I don't want to feel it I don't want to have to go through this it's something you have to go through and if you do things to make it so you don't feel it it's going to have a negative result or effect later in life it's going to come out later in life if you don't go through those things and process it so cry it's okay to cry you will feel better when you do it it's okay to mourn it's okay to grieve and that is just natural it's something that you have to do and go through the next thing is going to be to laugh and this is something that you will feel you may feel guilt over you may feel guilt over feeling joy or laughing or smiling when you're going through that like I shouldn't be feeling this I should just be feeling the worst of the worst but you have to let your heart have a break you have to you cannot you cannot keep going through things without taking a break to laugh I remember the days after I lost my dad I would just just crying all night long crying myself to sleep my head my face it just all I went whole school hurt from crying so much and I remember I would watch like a stand-up comedy thing on I've watched a lot of Dane Cook I would watch it just to laugh and cry and just give my heart a break from what that was feeling like and just make sure you laugh it's good for the body just like crying is laughter is healing it actually does something in your body and changes how you're feeling chemically in your brain you have to do those things to appease don't feel guilty about it you just have to do something to let that break in the heart ain't happen and your loved one would want you to do that they want wouldn't want you in the depths of misery where you can't laugh and just have one this letting your heart rest they would love you and want your heart to feel a little bit of that break from the pain um the next thing I would say is to talk and sometimes you don't want to talk to anybody grieving you just want to be alone and you just need a hug or someone to cry with you and sometimes it's good just to talk about talk about what you're feeling talk about uh good memories that you have with other people talk about the good things don't go to the negative parts talk about all of the good things that you have and also this goes for closure with things where if you feel that you have unresolved issues that you wanted to tell the person asks for forgiveness maybe things your matter upset about them for or or just sad feelings that you're feeling I read many books on grief grieving loss how to deal with loss many brochures on it and a lot of them really made the emphasis of get a chair or stuffed in whatever it is and sit it there like it's the person and talk about get everything out whether it's asking to forgive them talking about things that you're still upset over unresolved things you wish you could have tell them whether it was you didn't get to tell you love them one more time or there's something you wanted to ask for forgiveness for or whatever it is just really get that out and no matter what it is I guarantee that person knows that you love them when they're in heaven they don't care about the troubles and sadness of this earth so if you like no we didn't fix this thing that's not even a thought they're only thinking about good and wonderful things they're not thinking about those things anymore so just let all that go and know they're thinking the best of you and you hold on to the best memories of them also and another thing I would say is move not move on you got to move not on for the person but physically move you need do something physically moving your body you know in the days after my dad died I would go for runs or walks I would walk for two hours a day crying most of those two hours but that's where you physically you get those endorphins from moving you get the blood circulating it is just physically good for your body mentally good for you it just helps you process and get all those thoughts and things out and across and you will just start feeling better that was the most therapeutic thing I did was I would go on those two-hour walks or runs or whatever I'd be doing it just tears would be streaming down my face but in that some of the most beautiful things where I could just feel like my dad loving me from heaven and a cool part is I saw this spark plug one time when I was on my run and I just picked it up when I held it in my hand and I just felt like God was letting me find that to say and if you don't believe in God that's okay these are just my stories I'm sharing with you guys I just felt like God let me find that and that was like reminding me like my dad loved cars and saying like he was the spark plug to my heart where he would still be there combusting love and inspiration in my heart and too recently I was in Paris and the funny thing was is I was at this flea market which I was like this is like a dream come true I always wanted to be at a flea market in Paris and I remember I look over and I see a giant it was like a giant champion sparkplug like old metal antique sign and I just felt like it was like my dad reminding me like you're in Paris and this is maybe like a little kind of earthly dream of yours coming to you to be in Paris flea market not big in the grand scheme of life but I could feel like my dad saved I am here I am the spark plug in your heart that's totally not going to cry that is going to keep sparking that combustion of love and inspiration in your heart no matter where you go and the last thing would be - this is where you decide you can either decide to be bitter and sad and miserable and just fall apart and let your world come crashing down into depression of course you're going to be grieving and mourning and sad and all those things at some point you have to decide I'm going to live bigger bolder better with more courage more dazzle more that person's love that I want to Sparkle and share with the rest of the world I want to make bolder choices do bolder things go after things in honor of my dad in honor of the person that you've lost I'm going to celebrate holiday because I want to make my dad proud lucky this is so awesome doing a shrivel I'll be like I don't want to celebrate holidays anymore I want to do this anymore no you go do it and you go do it ten times bigger and better in their honor you decide that you're going to live bigger bolder and better in honor of that person and now I'm going to share with you guys because I just want to open up so you guys understand my story my grieving things my dad's going to tell you really really quickly so basically I love my dad he was always might inspire encourage or every day he would text me encouragement he was so proud of my youtube he was just always so so so proud of me and um I mean we just always my dad could encourage anybody he could just make you feel like you could do anything in the world and I to this day I missed that and I miss feeling safe my dad would just always make me feel like everything was going to be ok and don't worry about it you know when he would just say you know don't say your problems you have challenges because you can overcome those problem you can't overcome challenges you can over come he was always trying to find a positive way always laughing always fun always happy um and so my dad was gonna pick me up at the airport that day I had been at my sister's house my mom was driving me to the airport and me and the kids were gonna fly home my dad was gonna pick me up in a couple hours I texted him that morning like Oh dad can you pick me up for the airport he said of course and I remember in an instant I was like in a hurry getting ready to go and I was like I should text my dad I love my god he knows I love him and then later that bothered me for a little bit but I'm like you know what my dad knew I love him whether I texted him or not he knew it already so to stop guilting myself he's not he's not in heaven be like ah she should've told me she loved me one more time um so we're on the way the airport um and then I get a call and the call was like uh it was like is this candy or something like that are you sitting down or whatever and I was like this is a weird way to call somebody on the phone like at first you know if you called me and then to tell me ask him I'm sitting down that was just weird and so I said yeah and then I just remember this voice lady's voice just kept saying your dad's gone to be the Angels your dad's gone to be with the Angels and I was just like I couldn't process it my brain couldn't process I felt like I was like hyperventilating like couldn't breathe I felt like I wanted to throw up pass out I felt like I see stabbing in my heart it was just like I remember sitting there and looking up at the sky out through the front windshield and I wanted to like I wanted to like bust through the windshield and go up to heaven like I didn't want to be on this earth and feel this pain anymore and I didn't want to believe what she was saying like it was so hard for my brain to be hearing what she's saying and then my heart to try to process it like I just it just wasn't happening you know like that's not supposed to be what you're hearing and expecting it wasn't like he was he was old and I was expecting he was going to die you know I was supposed to see him at the airport in just a little bit and pick me up and so um I come to find out my dad had gone to a friend's house to help those moving to help take some curtain rods down and he was on a ladder they're not sure that nobody's really sure the details like there's no cameras there there was nobody to see what happened basically somehow his arm went through the window there the drills on the other side um it cut an artery in his armpit like right underneath here and uh you know I wanted to know every detail from every police officer there I wanted to know what happened what time did they get there was he breat was he caught just like I need I felt like in my brain I needed to know every detail possible and then when I did find those details out it just kind of just hurt so much to imagine my dad going through I wonder so was he in pain you know I wanted to know which hospital is he going to why didn't they what was the care flight there was the a who got there first the the helicopter or the ambulance and it didn't matter my dad was already in heaven um but I didn't eat I couldn't I just affects people differently you know and I was just I just would wake up and be sleeping though and I'd wake up I'd be like it would hit me that my dad wasn't here like the second I would wake up right after and I'd be like I don't even want to be awake I just want to go back to sleep again and it gets better there is not one day that goes by that I don't miss my dad or think about my dad I want to call him so many times and it's just something it's like some lights went out in my world and they're never going to come back on those lights were my dad and and that part of my world is forever altered and changed and it's okay you learn to live with it and get used to it but there's still things that I want you know every time something good happens I want it like tell my dad because he would be so proud of me and then every time something hard is going on it justify missed him definitely more when I'm going through hard times and I'm sad I definitely miss him more I just want to talk to him and I want him to hug me and um and I will just always miss him but I've decided in my heart that I'm gonna live bigger and bolder and better and honor for my dad whatever I'm gonna do I'm gonna do all those things my dad said that he said you make life around you better and you make people that come in contact with you better for having been in your presence and I just I hope that I do that I hope I love everybody around me I hope that when people leave my presence they do feel more loved or encouraged or inspired I hope that I'm making it different this life is so short and so temporary and the dumb things of this world popularity followers money all those things are so meaningless people are working so hard for things in success and what they look at in this world is so dumb I remember like right after my dad passed away I'd see people tweeting about things like oh my gosh it's so hot outside want like complaining about these dumb things and I was just like I've lost my dad and you're complaining about like how hot it is outside like you would just see things and I wonder like why why is my dad gone like why did he have to go and that's not a question that you need to ask in this life this world has fallen and perfect fully evil people hurt awful things this is not our heaven this is not a perfection it's flow awful things that we have to deal with and get through and figure out how we're going to be strong and get through those things and um you guys I know I know some of you guys do not believe in God I'm just telling you what aqua I feel so you guys don't have to agree with this or whatever I'm just saying what I feel um for me personally my hope is in heaven that I'm gonna see my dad and that I I mean as a person I believe that Jesus died for my sins and all of our sins we we are free from the troubles and awful things of this world so that we can be with him forever in heaven this is what I believe if you don't believe Title II okay um but for me I know that my hope is not this world and not in things of this world it is in heaven that I know I'm going to see my dad again this there's a song when I was driving home with all my dad's belongings and I wanted to just go pack him up myself because my mom and sister hadn't flown back yet I just wanted I didn't want them to have to deal with that pain so I wouldn't I packed up everything that in my dad's house which I don't know because right when I flew home immediately I went to go pick up his things from the hospital not the hospital the UH the coroner's office or whatever it is and I just remember I started crying instantly because they gave me his bracelet and I put it on and I was like oh my gosh I was like I want to wear his copper bracelet and then I looked down and it wasn't copper it was I really promised I was not gonna cry in we're just gonna talk about the facts it was not a copper bracelet it was silver and it was his his blood that was on the bracelet and made it look cooperate huh and I loved her diaphragm and I just like broke down and I was just crying in the coroner's office the lady came out was like trying to comfort me and I went to his to his house where he was living and I just was touching his tools and there's his room smelled like it and I just wanted I couldn't I was so frustrated like I smell your smell here and you're not here you know it was like so uh I just like I laid on the bed and I just breathed in this blankets cuz they smelled like him and I was like oh I hate that I can smell you but you're not here you know and so I did know how I was gonna do it they prayed my promises are just prayed I'd be able to have this drink to pack everything up I did I packed up everything so quickly and amazingly I don't even know how it was possible I was just in by myself just putting all his clothes and everything together and until his dad I don't really know how I did so quickly and as I was driving home in his car with all his things in it you know and I remember I had the sunroof open and I just remember I looked up in this song to this date it's amazing spec building 429 and it says take this world and give me Jesus this is not where I belong something this is not where I'm not home yet this is not where I belong we're here home is in heaven and any of the troubles and problems of this world like you could take them you could have them this world's full of junk that I don't personally like dealing with and we each have awful heartache and hurts and things to deal with and we've lost somebody that we loved or know of you know and for me it was hard because like one thing that I've always dealt with where I have like major anxiety over is the thought of eternity like it just going on and on never stopping and like like major anxiety I have over this like hyperventilating I can't breathe thinking about it and I remember that bothered me all my life since I was a kid and and I never like to talk about a tree you're having to like freak me out a little bit and then I remember when my dad went to heaven I felt like he was paving the passing it's okay I'm going here first to let you know that I'm okay and this is where you want to be now because I'm there I'm there now and I remember I was like I read all these books on heaven what I thought heaven was like what people thought heaven thought I thought what you know people had been to heaven what other people thought he was like books about everything and it really comforted me to know like that took that fear away and not like my dad did it on purpose but like knowing that my dad's there's like one more thing that my dad did to let me know would all be okay so I just hope this video comforts you guys I hope this makes sense and to end it on a positive note just make sure that you're living bigger better and

a sweeter place everywhere so today who do you get told that you look like vanellope von schweetz ah so today you will be vanilla p1 sweets from the movie wreck-it Ralph she kind of she's like a feisty little these monthly cute little candy haired girl yeah and she's kind of the underdog so I relate to that cuz she's just like a glitch like she's like yeah like a little problem or a little thing but he's like the most valuable part she ends up being those yeah like special partner yeah she's like where do I fit in and you're like right here with us right here right here you she's literally gonna be right here okay so we are gonna basically just make you look like a cute a cute vanellope version of yourself we're not going to do like a cartoon actually making you look like the cartoon one cuz it could come out more scary-looking I've noticed when I do the cartoon transformations so first step okay I have to make you take off your makeup okay let's do it ever do videos I don't think I have one this is me first it's gonna be naked face for the first time I'm getting naked for a better night title we make it up a lot more views we didn't what is this tart like city fathers Oh smells so good it's for removing waterproof mascara if you had a new family ooh decimal it's plural delicious do you have a lash extensions or just oh these are just glued I can pop them ah oh oh my god yeah a little bit so we're just gonna put a base of foundation so we're just gonna put a light color all over similar to hers cuz her and I both have pale skin which is perfect and her hair is jet black and eyebrow candy I don't know if I've ever told you this what but my natural hair color is black is black no way ha ha ha makeup isn't the only trickery my hair is not actually blue no I think that would be so cool if people were born with rainbow colored hair no you have such good skin it's incorporating I drink a lot of water that helps I love water you do does that really help your skin your drinking water it hydrates all of your cells so they don't get into raisins and then your skin looks shrim wooly and it helps flush all the junk out okay so we're gonna do like a little bit of highlighting so we're just gonna brighten up underneath the eyes yes what's a typical this is like what you do in any makeup looks this is no just for vanellope looks natural glam yes okay now we're just gonna add like a little bit of vanellope contour because she's not like those old-school cartoons that are just one color no she's got some computer-generated graphic shading on her face we're gonna mix just a couple shades darker okay and your actual skin tone and she's got a little on the sides of her face on the cheeks on the cheekbones right here she's got some around the chin area your skin is really really good is it behaving well yes it listen if you gotta talk with it before I got here it is like yes thank you stuff together can't be gonna be here and she's a makeup guru gives your stuff together this is my favorite a long time really this is the best translucent powder in the world okay little Millsy a throne you sent down there well it's really just Laura Mercier my French and fans I like it French in French in faith see it's there we can start a bonus you do general just go finish in fancy and we'll just say things I'm a French and we'll be doing my french bulldog Oh more French by the second okay so we're just gonna do a basic a nude I cuz she doesn't really have anything on her eyelid so it's a pretty youthful look yeah it's pretty open she's about like a bright we'll do like a little little eyeliner and then we'll do some really fun lashes and these brows these are gonna be the business okay so I think we're good I shadow you've done as fast as I makeup ever then we're just gonna do huh I liner so she's got just like a little hint of it lengthen it's basically gonna be a base for our lashes this is the only time when I do videos where I get so quiet the lip liner in the eyeliner I can't move yeah you can't do brain surgery if the fake makeup was as important as brain surgery this would be it we might do a little wing for you at the last minute person you may be moving for a baby now they did this the side that gets this year's close to again oh my like I'm not sure that you're gonna like your having your first kiss for me it's weirdest for me because my hands going in a different direction we got and this is a very brand new liner and sometimes when you first use them like the color doesn't come out as dark as its supposed okay now I say open perfect now they're like twins and whenever you do your winged eyeliner just like the eyebrows they are sisters and not twins so don't go crazy if one is going to put mascara on nobody will tell even if you make a mess I've heard that that eyebrows are sisters nobody's I'm not one person that I brought are the same and I'm gonna take the black eyeshadow okay and then close for me and I'm just going to push the eyeshadow onto the eyeliner and then I just smudge it right slightly above so if you have any Wiggles or wobbles this will like blur them and smooth them out and it also makes eyeliner not shiny because a lot of liquid eyeliners are really shiny and I don't like shiny it's like patent leather I was it looks a little bit so I like to make mo matte so will you just push them right on and it makes it last longer so you get like three bonuses in one and you just push it down you push it like down into the lashes so it makes your lashes really black - I can yeah just like pressing in there so in pure lower line it just looks like brown like a little tinted brown we're just gonna take this taupe eye line and it tobe very like I so you're gonna look up for me and then I'm gonna pull this away and then we're just gonna line the waterline that inner little I know this feels super weird huh oh yeah this one feels don't we're ditching it doesn't feel bad it just feels weird yeah because this part of your eye is not meant to have makeup actually but I'm we're breaking so many body rules then I'm gonna take an angled brush and a brown eyeshadow and then look up for me and again I'm gonna pull the eyelid away and I'm just gonna push this Brown into like the lash line because she doesn't have lower eyelashes but we're just gonna give that definition down below so we just pull them away okay now we're going to do the lashes last we're gonna joke to the eyebrows so we've got some head mini look it's never before been you know he was very similar eyebrow shape you have really good eyebrows he's gonna fill this in and it's like it's not black black it's like the darkest darkest dark brown mm-hmm so it won't look like traumatizing to you know this is more the cartoon brow shape but I'm ready are you ready oh my gosh that's high school yes that's high school where did that dark yeah they were black what yeah really my sister always had light brown hair no way and they had jet black hair okay I'm gonna have you curl your lap you know okay Isis okay you showed me oh I'll do it for you know what you were you showed me okay so you're gonna look okay okay okay you did it it doesn't hurt it just very weird will to see a device coming near your eye it's very alarming but it makes a huge difference okay I will let you put your own mascara okay because you I can I know you can do that it's the one thing I can you're a pro if you give me mascara and lip gloss got it that's my makeup tutorial everybody here's mascara don't get it in your eye if you can help it and if you can't video over thanks cry me I like a blink blink blink okay no she has got a lot of rosy blush on loose all weird every time right eyebrows it's high school okay so we're gonna use this very you're gonna look even more in gellick and like a chair a baby with this blush on so she's just got like a lot of wash on I mean even if you put it on with a sponge because I think you'll get a better application yep mm-hmm yes that is very glowy cheeks and then we're just gonna put like a little flush of it under nosey because she's got a really red nose she does and we're not gonna do just the tip of it cuz it'll look a little Rudolph II you have such a cute nose oh noes it would be in like doctors offices or people want to look like yours like look at this perfect cute nose I'm gonna try putting the flash on even though I don't know if we're gonna use him he is kind of fun actually yeah oh my gosh I love it these eyelashes are the hardest thing for me to do well it depends on the eyelash Briand too because sometimes the cheaper ones are the hardest to get on okay oh my gosh these lashes are so fun huh oh my gosh that'd be the Lawrence you look like a deer I feel like a snapchat filter dude you look like a snapchat filter this is really starting to look like Penelope okay all that's left is to do your lips and then the wig oh can be epic proportions so I'm gonna mix up a custom lip color okay I'm gonna line your lips first then you're going to click this custom oh Allah I'm not going to line the shape that she has because she has an interesting shape lip and usually thin what yeah and you have really nice lips so I'm not gonna try to make your lips look like they're not there because you have great buttons what this night this sorry oh my you didn't my lips my lips are too buff big yeah they're just reflex they're like the rock and then I don't like these twist-up ones because they get all crumbly and then if you just use a pencil hmm you can sharpen it to a point and just like when you're drawing you want a really fine point okay we just need a base out one now we're gonna mix our custom vanilla Pecola oh this is perfect this is like the perfect PGP okay your lip is done you look so adorable now it is time to go get your win okay put the wig cap on use okay you make like two little horns right here

whoa if I didn't show you that I did this I would think I got lip injections if you think this video is cool give it a thumbs up like share with all your friends and make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out in any more videos bye mwah okay so first a bunch of people did that Kylie Jenner lip challenge where they were using shot glasses and cubs and weird things to create section for their lips that is not a safe or wise idea always use a tool that was created for the job you want to do for step one I'm going to use a tool that was designed to plump up the lips and strengthen the muscles around the mouth this is the lip people it's a very shallow suction device that's made of plates not made of plastic or rubber or something that can change shape with the suction and can create a weird or odd shape this is shallow and creates just enough suction to draw the blood and flew it to the lips making them look plump for hours but as you increase the muscles around your mouth it will maintain the fullness for much longer it's funny because a lot of people like oh you got lip injections when I guess they didn't see the video where I did this I'm going to show you how we do that I'm going to fast forward it you can create the suction like this and you want to do this for about 30 seconds and I will show you a 30-second time lapse but what happens 30 seconds Lee now this is for regular plumping if you want to get them extra big I will do 30 second floor whoa this totally if I didn't show you that I did this I would think I got lip injections look at my lip I don't know if I've ever used it this long before whoa step 2 I'd like to use a newt or light pink color this is always going to make lips look the largest or biggest that they can so I'm going to mix kind of a pink color and a peachy color first now I'm going to line the lips I'm going to be using soar from Mac which is one of the colors Kylie Jenner uses but a drugstore option for this is Milani nude as you can see on top is Milani nude below is max soar so they're pretty close now what we want to do we line the lips is you want to shade the corner so it looks like they're being pinched like that so you want to open your mouth line right in the corner a little darker and then I'm going to slightly over draw the lips just a little bit and gently blend it upwards and again get in the crease in the corners really well and then blend it now this this is crazy my lips look so much bigger than they ever do then I'm going to take a mid to darker Brown lip liner this is 7 C from makeup forever or for drugstore option you can use Revlon Colorstay and Sienna so on top is our makeup forever below is the Revlon they're pretty close so for this you want to draw the creases that's showing the lip is puckered kinda like that so the areas we're going to draw is that the way you drop your puckered like this right here on the sides of this first Center bump you see how already it looks like oh I look like a Bratz doll and then we're going to do that on the bottom too so we're going to go one in the center again you can scrunch up your lips like this Center side and side you want to create those pillow looking puffy like puffs of your big full lips then you just want to blend that in a little so just soften those with brush strokes and your last step is taking your highlight color which you can even use a super light lipstick or a highlighter that you use for your face so if you want to do the light lipstick this is just a light color from map I would put this right here on these top curved hearts right underneath where you line reviewing like this it would look the most puffy right there if you did chest face right there on the outside edges that's going to make it look three-dimensional and really rounded in like plump and clumpy and like super lip and Jack B and then if you want you can take a highlighter like this and again dab it right in the center right on this Ridge right here above with your lip layers down here right here on this outermost curvy lower edge and right here on the top and instantly I look like a Bratz doll this is crazy you guys I don't know this is way not like my normal lips look at all if I saw this video and I didn't tell you I did this or show these steps I'd be like you got lip injections but you where we saw our lips before and they look nothing like this so this goes to show you guys you can do it more dramatically if you do this with other colors the same rules apply so if you use a red you can use a darker brown red or wine to really do the contouring and create that shading you can do this with any color you have your light color and then whatever is a few shades darker than that to create the drama in the curve and then your highlight so this was a nude color you can go even lighter just make sure that your lighter color is two to three shades darker for sure and then your highlight color is two to three shades lighter than the color you put all over play around with all different colors and try this and let me know what you think how often fun was this makeup is Co Rosie and I hope I'm just teaching you cool tricks too you know makeup is about accentuating things and this is totally accentuating the lips if you guys want I'll put a link below where you guys can get this to up with that blonde video um this is so I mean look at my moon I don't talk like this but that is so breast ball level plump lips I'm comment below what you guys would like to see next and how crazy this lip look is share with all your friends and blew their minds with this lip crazy look and make sure you follow me on snapchat Twitter Instagram Facebook everyone back candid Johnson you can find there and stalk

it's been almost like two months since I've gotten there like a lot of roots you can see my dark hair and then the red hair and it takes like a long time like seven hours for her to like take this into the cut my hair and put it back in so I think I'm gonna just show you taking them out and what my hair looks like if you guys remember when I first got them in my hair was still very short like right about here and then now we're gonna see how long it is and what it looks like out and we'll see what my hair looks like Barbie's looking at me with a questioning I like mm-hmm but I will show you guys what that process looks like I'm off to the salon right now let's get ready for the adventures of removal of hair extensions with yours truly kandi so here's my fabulous friend Nikki that is taking mine out this is how long my real hair is and then nikki is working on taking it's been too long this is like an attic at the root it's looking real not good but just a little bit but I trust nikki is American worker and she is going to kitty cuz this is a really cute look on the side it always lets me watch it it will be way better right Nikki's right get dressed honey so we just took all of the knots out this is my real hair look how long it is like I'm Rapunzel a short haired Rapunzel ah now we're gonna color my roots and this is already a million look at how long my hair is it's really long I'm kind of impressed we only untangled knots for like an hour get the extensions up I would like to almost over two months of not getting them done and retouched up so like all of the hair that should be falling out you're supposed to lose like I don't know 7,500 hairs a day and they just get stuck and gotten matted and so just combing those out too so long but look at how long knotted I had naughty hair but it's much better now god this is amazing so now we're at the fun stage with the bleach of my roots to lighten it blonde it's itching so bad but this is what nikki gives me she gives me this comb and I can just do that oh that feels so great you don't even know I don't know what I would do without this tool and then now what are we doing Nikki we're gonna put some clear on your ends to see if you can get any left if we can light from it for a toss around and bring us I know I get some gentle left look at this blonde see these baby guys right here and right along my face it's like they lighten to clear and then when my tears out they stay clear it's like they don't hold color and they don't ever grow I don't know what is the deal with those baby here they need to have a get on the plan meeting look we're already getting blonde at my roots adios dark roots look at that look at those little temples they're just lighting in right up yeah they get really light let's wipe that off okay so today are we just we're not putting the red on we're just gonna lighten in we're not gonna put the red on this part because we're gonna try and do a little bit of a light all right we're gonna start with the red here yes and you will kind of blend it in it's what I would like to call a baked peach color right like burnt peaches my hair look at all of that hair hair she goes that's so much hair I wish we had all this so there's some of the hair knots that we brushed out from floor yeah now we are dying the roots red again okay so now nikki has what did you call this Nikki a blur brush and this is how she blends the color so it gets a real on braid it just looks like a blush brush that is so cool mmm it is like permanent makeup for your hair okay I just take a picture with you then you're just interested okay we will take it so this is after Nikki colored and cut it but our phase two we have to order more hair so for a few days I'm gonna be wild and free with my short no extension here which I was looking at long this is it was like up to here when Nikki started putting extensions and so we've grown we've grown a lot thanks Nikki for staying here so late you're such a good friend this is a hundred percent my real hair and i 100% do not like it i'll tell you guys why and i'll show you my hair befool haired miss in a second when when we finished and ellie was in the salon and she saw my hair like my real hair she started crying didn't she was like but you're right hair back so I'm gonna change it back I've already ordered the extended we're gonna do something totally new and different she already showed me like what she's doing to them like the coloring and everything and I love it so I'll do a whole new video on that but let me just tell you guys so nothing about like my hair too far out nothing like that it's just the natural haircut that I have so as you guys know when I first got the extension my hair was like up to like right about my ears like it was really short the back part is growing really long pretty much what it looks like is it looks like a guy with a little baby man bun it looks like a guy man button here that's what this looks like and this is better than when it's down because I will show you so as you know like my bangs were shorter when I had my hair cut and then this was like a little longer so as this is grown long this just keeps beating trim so we can do like this side-swept banging thing so basically it's resulted in like a mullet look of my hair like my hair is not damaged or anything like it's nothing like that but look this is not a cute this is not cute it just looks like it looks like man mullet hair I don't like it like these sides are short and then like back here it gives long like there's no way we could make it cute unless we cut it all this short length again to match my bangs and this is just I mean I have the thinnest hair in the world like look how thin this hair is this is like herelet's I used to joke that like you could just go and you would blow-dry my whole head that's how thin my normal hair is so then when you get the extensions you're like look at all this full of joy his hair and then when it comes out you're like oh my gosh it's like I'm bald almost so the extensions I had we already ordered him they're coming back to come back into my hair so they were just like through the bead kind not the taping because that made my hair fall out for sure but the little bead cut it was like a little - that smashes down it's like a silicone inside to protect it and it's so it sticks your hair so those are put in like every few little like it feels like centimeters or whatever on your head and then all your hair is held in place there so when you do take them out you lose like 75 to 100 hairs a day that's how many you're supposed to fall out a day so when they're trapped in here the hairs don't fall out so when you do take them out it does feel like your hair's falling out but it's not it's just like the dead hair that you've been shedding since you have the extensions and they haven't been able to fall out but um this is just back to my normal thin hair and I don't like it it is just so thin so thin it's so gross so we are ordering new hair on the way to come back in and it's going to be a new you will see it will be a new color arrangement a new color something because I just but one thing I do like is you can't really scrub your head like when you have the extensions and so for that parent like I can just scrub my scalp like crazy and I love it other than that I don't I don't like this little puffy fluffy hair it is just like oh I don't like it I wake up I look in the room like oh and then when I wash my face at night I'm like oh so I'm gonna go back to the extensions until my things you're not gonna cut them anymore until these guys can start growing longer so I don't have a mullet haircut that's not a try I'm not trying to bring the mullet back and I don't want to cut it short again cuz that's why I got the extension in the first place cuz I was tired of the short hair I had short hair for a long time I've had long ever longer I shaved my head once I saw all these kind of things and basically my favorite I mean it depends sometimes I like the short hair for like a day and then I mostly like the long hair I do view I mean blow-dry my hair just took me like 30 seconds to blow-dry my hair she um I mean I don't want to do it it's just like this put in ponytails so ugly so that is a story of my hair extensions they will be going back in if you want to see why you guys can check out my vlog channel candyland I will put a link below and you can see like more of me the hair salon getting the

let's get started I have some copyright free music thanks to nocopyrightsounds on so we can hear a little something and um I didn't know I was actually going to film this tutorial so I already put my foundation on and then I was like you know I should just film doing this I makeup looks so we're going to go ahead and do that also i was working on set and the makeup artist had this by Smashbox it is the halo hydrating perfecting powder and it like twist up in this cool little thing and I was like what is that powder using and then she told me it's really cool she kept putting it underneath my eyes and swung back something you guys may not know any time I do something that isn't a youtube video i always do my own makeup but they will bring makeup artist there to like touch me i'm just putting a staircase to get shadow follows actually but um and she was touched me up with this number like what is that beautiful like yellow powder that is making my skin look I just going to click on quite a bit this is also on the left of the brush for making looks i have this is the brush I'm using underneath me I so I'm gonna put that all right there and then this just check out how cool these pallets are can you guys be like whoa whoa well it's exploding not going outside know it's really cold in here so i have like these little bloody things on and like warm boots because I don't know my heater is not heating this room very well um so inside this is the this is the new cover shot palette this is the mat I palette look at the mat ipad these are so let's focus focus these are such pretty colors that i'm going to be using today so so the first color I'm going to get this one right here and I'm just going to place them on the center of my eyelid and work to the outer corners also something that I kind of wanted to talk about is I don't like watching has become a really big thing and some eyeshadows don't swatch well but they go better on the eye and some ice watch really great on the hand but they don't blend well on your eyes why don't you guys me full i'll be swatching that you see because a lot of things on your hand will look different than actually going on a different tender skin of your eyelid and blending ability will be totally different these are amazing i'm going to take this light yellow color right here and I'm going to go on the inner corner of the eye and blend them over like so and I brought the note of the watching up because this this product blends so well the pigmentation is just absolutely amazing house blend and goes on your eyelid like incredibly impressed by this i'm going to take this totally color and then this brown color and kind of mix them together and I'm going to push that right up here into the crease both sides you just push around where you feel your eyeball is and that's kind of like where you're faking your crease at and then I just blend this upwards towards the eye brow because I get on a tear I'm gonna take this smoky like purpley kind of color and I want to go underneath the eye right here on the outer corner smudge importantly inter corner the inter corner in your corner intergalactic corner just kind of smoke him so much more going to take a little bit of this color and a little bit of this red brown color I'm gonna go with the corner of the eye and we're just going to try to start darkening him a little bit and something that's what I do like right about now is I will just take a black eyeliner and I was just like the waterline well it stopped and just mainly from the middle part of the eye for the outer corner and then you're going to take where do I have a little guys a little angle brush and then just kind of smudge him and work him into the lash line over here to hold your skin taut you know I'm pulling on it but you gotta hold it still or when you move your brushes like scrubbing your island all over the place make little fake wing right here you're just dragging the eyeliner out there you guys need to zoom anymore or not but I'm going to take my angle brush I'm using a giant angle or so I feel like cutting the time of the job done faster so I'm just gonna take this black over here and I just pressing on top where we just put the liner and then just let him out on top just kind of fun and a little and then school in the corner and I like up into the crease a little but the eyeshadow colors kind of come off so it just makes like really soft soft color now we'll do that over here on this side sorry when I do like as i get like really serious and I cannot talk is going to the money little the key thing i like about my smoky eyes when I do them and I like to leave this part like otherwise it just looks like you said like the whole black eye and you can do that look that totally okay i just like to leave that a little bit lighter which I love all these colors for so I'm gonna take a little more this smoky color this Toki color and this lighter peachy and I'm just going to go back on the center and make sure it doesn't get too dark then I'm going to get this light is yellow and even this like pinky or color right here and place that right in the corner keep that really light right there and I'm gonna get some of this color and this brown again and maybe even this color right there i'm going to go back into the crease just like from here to the crease out not only and just out here on the outer parts and just Pat him I'm going to place the color with like a flatter brush and then i'm going to go back with this guy is fluffier one and it's love your brush and then I just kind of go on top and kind of blend and make it look all smoothie and then we need a lighter color underneath the Browse I'm with the yellow we do that right there right over here now i'm going to go back and we'll get into new min walk wrong way think that all this camera crew you break i might take this little pudgy guy and I'm going to take this black color and this dark plum me and I'm really going to go in the corner and kind of smoke this out so right there increase to our last I'm just gonna smoke it and as the color comes off my brush and move towards the center over the is now we're going to do that over here in thing right there in the corner I shadow comes off I move it towards the center oh my i would me a little bit fluffier i'm going to take this bigger dome-shaped smudgy guy and I'm gonna take this color and this one's lighter and more purpley and then I'm just going to and when the color we put on my grandma gave me these little lovey things and they totally match my fingernails look at loves fingernails what trends you guys hope go away and stay for makeup like comment below I kind of hope it's like a more return to a more simple eyeshadow look I think like not a natural more like simple i guess is what i would say so now now what you're going to do now I'm gonna take this more brownie color these two brownie ones and i'm just going to dab them out here on the outer corners this is going to be long gate the eyes so we're going to do that and then go up towards the end your brows I'll get out open out to you guys I think I'm

[Music] yeah everybody look who's blonde it's your girl candy yeah I still have two pink hair over here this is a bad guy the way don't look at this cheap plastic sides away I am going to show you this one Stefani was from her spark the fire video I think is adorable it's cute it's awesome I love it it's so easy to do you ever show you with extra watches you don't have to put those on you can just do all the simple steps so get ready as we come along and I'll show you how to do this look Linda loving this long hair okay I'll stop looking at my hair and we'll start with you tuturro prepare yourself back to pink hair and no makeup kandi is 3 to 1 okay so everything I'm using today can be found in the drugstore is all entirely from Revlon I'm using all Revlon Gwen is a relative Basinger I'm a Revlon ambassador the first thing we're going to start off with is our foundation because that is the milp info so I'm going to be using the Revlon Photoready airbrush effect which I love because you really can get a perfected airbrush look and I'm going to use a little red lon spongy tool as well I just dab and press it onto the skin I really like this flat tip part because you can get really up close to the lash line as well now I'm going to take Revlon Photoready concealer and I'm just going to use this it's kind of like a primer on my eyelid I always do this with my concealer anyway and we're just going to go underneath the eyes switched it over to their rounded side and then you can push in along the nostrils and nose under the eye area now we need to set it with powder so I'm going to be using the Revlon Colorstay pressed powder in light and we just want to set our foundation and press it in around the eyelid you want to set those guys - I know foundation takes the longest always so like it's like the most boring part of the videos like okay let's move along and get to the fun part I think we're looking very pale very perfect just like I wanted now I'm going to go ahead and do the blush this is the Revlon Oh baby pink blush and I happen to I'm just going to try to it's the airbrush effect you can switch the shape of these guys so I'm just going to take some of the pink and roll it on here I've never actually done it this but it is going to place the blush right on my cheek and for this look she doesn't really have like a lot of blush I'm just going to add like a little pop of color generally fun to do your blush this way so it's barely adding like a little glow I don't really want it to look like a lot of blush because her look it looks like there isn't any really even on babies could add a little bit of color to the face okay now that our cheeks flushing is all set is times route through the eyes so this color is amazing it's the Revlon Colorstay cream eyeshadow in 705 it's like this beautiful pearly color and this is a key to when like beautiful babydoll kind of open eye which i think is going to be really brushed for like a new summer look also just like a bear beautiful eye so I'm just going to take a little bit of this and the little brush that comes right in the cap and I'm just going to Pat this on and this really lasts all day long it makes your eye shadow or anything you place on top left a really long time I'm just going to spread this here in the center over on this side okay now it's time to do eyeshadow so so this is the 5:05 impressionist Revlon eyeshadow palette whoops there goes a little brush and I'm going to take my Oliver shadow brush and I'm going to take this light highlight color and I'm just going to press it right down here on the inner corner and then drag it towards the mid part of the eye so you get that really pretty pop of shimmer right there and then up here it's kind of works like the I like this is a highlight part under the brow so it's kind of set up that way in the palette so I'm just going to pop a little bit of that highlight look at that underneath the brow then I'm going to go back over to this a pallet row drop it in this is the rustic pallet in five two three from Revlon so it's got like more Goldy hues in it and I'm going to take this color and we're going to sweep it and kind of pull the crease all the way up to that highlight area then I'm going to go back over to this impressionist pallet and get this kind of all over the lid color and I'm going to pop them in the outer corner and then gently shave him in and up into the crease I'm just going to press him right here if you don't have a crease just push it in around though your eyeball and it was going wear a fake crease would be made and then we're just going to kind of soften and blend him out to the side just a little just a tiny bit this looked at how it looks a lot of contouring it's like a really pretty fresh eye look like that then I'm going to take our eyeliner brush and I'm going to dissonant this same brown color right there and I'm just going to gently press this underneath the lash line now I'm going to do the brows before you go into lashes I always like to start off at the point and then go do this underlines top and create our tail the thing about this formula is it has like like a waxy consistency so it acts like a seatbelt like it holds your brows into place like oh you're not going anywhere I've got you you're staying right here look at that brow looking better already so come in over here get a spoolie guys brush them up okay now we're going to do a little bit of line up so I got to bring my my mirror much closer to me for this because we're getting very very tricky here so this is the Revlon Colorstay liquid eye pen so I'm going to hold on to my eyelid and I always like to start right in the middle of eye and bringing up this line and go back in and fill in all that space and there's not much of a wing does look but I'm just going to do a slight something to like elongate the eye and this painting was a little baby wing there we go just a little baby wing guy we'll start over here do the same thing below when we're up close I see it really need to do some RL tweezing the lash lines going right in right on the inside of life where the skin is on the eyelid you'd want to start right in there and then pull it out and then right at the corner where I were just going to continue it where this part curves up for death we're going to put our little wing don't lose a wing already then I'm going to take my angle brush again this is the surreal I shadow palette from Revlon and I'm just going to take life right here and my angled eyeliner brush it isn't actually the smoky eye brush one side has an angle and one side has a smudgy guy this is such a cool little brush so I'm just going to press him right on top of the eyeliner we just did and this will help make it look a little more matte black and it will soften any little wobbly things I really push it in as a last line because I want it to look real ok so now we're going to curl our lashes so I'm going to be using the Revlon extra volume because who doesn't want extra volume in their lashes so I'm going to do a few closest bottom so Labatt and drying we're going to go ahead and do the lips so this is the Revlon Colorstay in fuchsia and we're going to slightly overdrive a lit for sure because it's kind of like what does look required so I'm just going to start here and this is such a good shade of hot pink like everyone should get this for summer for your pop of color hot pink summers of color and then you fill it in a little more at the corner if you stop in the outside line and into the table and for her particulars look it's very like rounded down and outward so I make sure we do that [Music] awesome the edges again on the corners now we're going to take our lipstick color this is called sultry Samba look at this color oh I love this color I just want to like bite it I love it so much they're just gonna awesome color so that hmm fingers okay now we're going with another coat of mascara because we're even if lashes on to this look because I think this is a key part of the look that she do we have on kind of a piece looks like big baby doll lashes I got these different lashes from Revlon so these are great because they're reusable and the cool thing about these are so cool there's little cut marks can you see through the case the cut marks on the lashes of where to trim them for different sizes so you can make it more like a demi whispies that is so helpful for people just getting starting to in wearing lashes so I got these full strips because it looks like she has full strip lashes on and then I also got the Revlon precision clear glue which I like because it's latex free because I have like latex allergy so latex in I last one was makes my eyes itch so I'm just going to wing it another little eyelash cutting scissors jumbo hair so I just cut lehtinen one you can see it I'm just going to cut this last little part up you could use the markings on the packaging of item also so then we take out glue weird I always start setting my Alice's on with my right eye first so this is a little weird I don't know why I did this worried throwing some real big curveball then we're going to take our glue and do the same thing over on the other arm lash okay so I just did a test I with these lashes to replicate this baby doll kinda lash look that you have so I took this bigger pair of lashes and I'm going to show you what we did so you're going to cut these in little sections like little tiny sections about that size you're just going to go through and cut these guys off like this look and I'm going to cut like four or five of them perfect okay so you take one of the longer pieces that you cut like this and then what I do is I just brush the end of him onto the actual little wand of the mascara or the eyelash glue and then I stick him on the outer part of the lashes and then push him down and you can see how it made it look longer like it looks like there's sections of longer lashes so get our glue you just rub the base of him onto that right there so you get glue on there and we're going to scoot over just another chunk and we're going to stick him down it's going over just so there's like a space and then another laugh because it looks like that's what's going on to do the same thing stick him on there then

no no pepper I work here am I gonna do okay fear is setting in she's very afraid she's never going to get these contacts out of her eye and will surely go blind Oh [Music] oh hello welcome to makeup masterpiece theater I'm your host candy Johnson and I will be taking on this epic adventure today today we'll be talking about one girl who looks much like myself also make sure you subscribe to me here on YouTube as well as snapchat Facebook and Instagram once upon a time there was a girl who put on lots and lots of makeup and wigs into YouTube tutorials and everybody always wondered how did she take the makeup off I also don't normally speak in this accent you guys have always asked how do you get all the makeup off your face when you do your crazy costume transformations I'm going to show you the extreme ultimate makeup removal are you ready even my teeth have makeup on them hmm the first thing that I'm gonna do is actually take this wig off I forgot I had little ears on that take the wig cap off and lo and behold my hair is pink just like the wig her makeup look was so extreme she had to remove makeup from her very teeth haha always remember when washing your face to tie your hair up or flip it away from your face and as all good tails have surprised twist of events when she went downstairs to show her mother her makeup look she realized lo and behold a package had come in the mail that could be helpful this very day then you guys couldn't be more perfect I went downstairs local carry my mail the vanity planet ultimate skin spa this is for cleaning exfoliating gonna make your skin look better whether you said acne or you have a whole buncha makeup on your face like this to get rid of it's got this exploiting bristle this little silicone watch I'm going to use to scrub all this off and then the everyday one so my clean face today is sponsored by vanity loaded so the first thing I'm going to do is apply an emulsifying cleanser to and cream base oil this one to get all this off I'm going to be using the Clinique take the day off makeup cleanser because I use this every day plus it also bits off crazy makeup looks like this this softens up all of the colored makeup or whatever you have on that way when you use the makeup removing tool it kind of just buffed it all off and gets it off of your pores who needs a smokey eye when you can have an entirely smoky face so I'm going to wipe off the bulk with the tissue if you use a washcloth or a towel you'll most likely stain it so tissues are your best option when you have crazy makeup looks like this why am i no still pink you better come off and because she had so much makeup on she had to repeat this process so when I'm just doing my normal makeup I do the cream thunder to get room the pigment and makeup that's on the top part of the skin then I cleanse it again to really get everything out of my pores so I'm trying to rinse a little bit of it off with the warm water she then wet her face got out her magical tool known as the vanity planet ultimate skin spa system applied her regular daily cleanser and watched it go to work little low rate your polls are crying out to be set free from the chains and suffocation of the makeup which has been applied on top of them and crammed and shoved down into each pore choking them out enlarging them and making them suffer blemishes and breakouts I want to do this on the home body it will exfoliate your lips as well you do it on there okay now that I gave them a rinse I'm going to swap the heads and put the regular one on to just daily oh this little girl right and I'm just going to give him a spin around really buff and slough off any dead skin around our nostrils to look I get like dead skin and stuff around there on the lips my chin where has this little blemish I should have had this guy to buff out the junk that was on my chin more and maybe that wouldn't have even happened this is going to stimulate your circulation I'm just going to do it on my chin hope wigs buff that little zit off want to take this in the showers I lived from a long nap often year off of this thing she then rinsed her face and felt her skin in all of its new smooth and incredible glory and shortly thereafter she forgot to record the rest of the clips of putting the moisturizer on but stay tuned that may be another video she also remembered that she had forgotten to take her color contacts out something that's very important she didn't want to go blind please be warned if you don't like close pictures of things being removed from people's eyeballs you may want to skip to the end of this video it is a loose live rabbit ha ha ah that's not gonna work actually I'm gonna take you all with your milled in your nails ha we're gonna give you out oh no no no better give me better finesse me no her no okay the fear is setting in the tension is growing greater she's very afraid she's never going to get these contacts out of her eye and will surely go blind oh no aah no and they'll put up a doctor man I got it out of my life hooray no no no god I don't know you guys oh my goodness array and as always we had our happy ending her face was restored to

at my nails they look like little boy hands every time I look down look like just little boy hands so just don't pay attention I'm gonna try to move my hands real fast so you don't even notice that I don't have like nails I mean I got nails but they like little boy nails okay back to the video this lavender lip might be like the new red lip for me I'm kind of obsessed with this it's called purple taffy and it's from Smashbox I'm filming a video of wearing lavender lipstick for seven days to see what we think different ways to wear it people's reactions what's for the general consensus so that's happening now that's why I got the lavender lipstick on so on to the favorite things should we start that's not an on makeup thing we'll just go crazy we're just gonna go rogue and jump all over the place it's also 11 o'clock at night one filming this so and we make us been on for quite a bit if anybody is going to point out that it's not on point okay so first up look at these teal matches you guys turquoise is like my favorite color this color these are from made market company and hey is Kansas I bought these on Etsy or Amazon I can't remember I'll try to find links if you guys want to buy them too but I ordered these and I love these because I feel like it makes my back we're in the jewelry sin event see with teal matchsticks and then it's got the little thing you like strike it here on the side it's just really kind of fun and I love these also well we're on to the same teal topic look at this Beautyblender you guys this color I want them bite it I want to like show it in my eyes I love this color so much this chillout teal Beautyblender this I don't know what's going on with my lights you guys like the lighting is like really bright and then I move things up and it gets dark I know what's going on you'd think after all the years I've been doing YouTube I would figure out the lighting but Noah don't so just hang on with me while we go there okay so a couple SC things I got this Etsy ring I can't find the other ring I got another cool when I was gonna show you guys but it's like a cool hinged like armour ring thing and I'll try to find the links where I got them they were all from like out of the u.s. they were made like this one came from Greece another one I came from where they came from then I got these cool little these cool little earrings look at how cute these little earrings are these are an Etsy purchase - I got some other things I got like this earring which may be a weird shape earlobes and they don't fit on there I don't know but I don't think he made it in the favourites he's cool they're like fit in my ear right okay we'll go to makeup things and then we'll come back to nan make of things so a couple favorites you guys I have been obsessed with this YSL all ours foundation it is just amazing like the pigment in this is so beautiful so amazing the coverage is so good I'm still putting my beyond perfecting from Clinique on because I had like more pigment in it so it's like super super coverage for foundation but that I put this like kind of all over the place and I just love this I wear this in bisque b45 but I don't know who's gonna match my skin tone but that's what I've been wearing I love this stuff also another thing I've been using you guys know if you know me I have used the Anasazi of beverly hills dipbrow pomade for so long but I've ventured into something new still in the honest ostia family but this is the dark brown brow powder duo I've been using this for probably the last month and I'm I kind of love it I use this with a little angled brush from Mac and I don't know I've just been doing my brows in it and I've kind of been like this is kind of replaced my dip brow for just a little while at least then another favorite this tartlet toasted palette is pretty good you guys take a look at these beautiful colors I'm wearing these two underneath my eye in the corner and then like one of these guys under the eyebrow and I think maybe like a top of that too just to smudge it around and give it like a little warmth like a nude eye but works and this smells good what do you smell it it smells kind of chocolatey I'm not sure another thing if you don't own this is the Clinique pretty easy liquid eyeliner pen I'm gonna go out on a crazy limb here and I'm gonna say this is the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used in my life this is how amazing this is it has like these little bristles so it makes it like a real paint brush but big it's the finest sharpest point I got a lot of liquid eyeliners you guys like so many from so many different brands everywhere this I have never been impressed with a liquid eyeliner brush pen like I have with this one the Clinique pretty easy I mean the best winged eyeliner ever I love this love this but when I lost it and I had to use my other ones like oh no oh forget it no my eyes are gonna look terrible okay so those are some makeup things and what do we have from Fenty beauty you guys this Fenty Beauty the kilowatt metal moon highlighter which it just looks like it's white oh my gosh I pop it on these cheekbones boom boom boom right up here dude is it you can do some nose highlighting you could do it i highlighting this is so beautiful it just gives like the most pure like a light beam of light and it's soft it's not literally it's just beautiful the metal moon kilowatt from Fenty beauty I love this stuff um oh now we'll do a little bit hair thing so I was born with not a lot of hair I have had thin hair my whole life when I was a baby I barely had any hair I'm barely having hair now if you were the same way you're gonna want this it is the Seraph you'll maximize dense effects from redkit this stuff is amazing you guys you like spray it in your roots you rub it around before you blow-dry your hair I mean they give you things like it makes your hair a hundred a thousand times thicker I would agree like when I don't use it it's depressing and then when I use it this is amazing it's a little costly I got this at the salon and it was as you can see 16:54 this little bottle but I still have a bunch left and I've used this for a long time you just use like a few squirts a day but this is amazing if you have thin here also since my hair has been shorter these have been favorites I've been using um this is from igk and it's the rich-kid coconut oil gel so it's kind of got consistency of like pudding like it looks almost like slime or something like it's kind of thick and then you I just rub it around and I like pull it on the ends of my hair to make it like a little I don't aren't looking oily or pomade II I just want like drive us separated it gives you that like seperated the kind of slept in hair um and then also this is from AG and it's texture and pomade it's called dry lift it smells like lemons which I'm not really that a big fan of but this is the dry lip stuff so you just rub it around like the paste and then I put it where I want like lift in my hair or definition even if you have long hair you could do this as well um it's the dry lift from Ag hair and again I got this at like the beauty supply store then um I've been having to like spray my hair in place more than when it was long so I use this Sebastian Horry shaper and this just smells like perfume like I love how this smells the Sebastian reshape er it just smells delicious so if you use this but my hair be smelling like okay now this is kind of like bath related I guess these are from Mistral these soaps I wish there was smellivision you guys this isn't sparkling peony and then this one oh my gosh this is apricot VOE not only do these look beautiful in your bathroom they smell so good like when I take a shower I'm just like I'm in like a garden of beauty and I never want to get out of the shower except I don't want to waste water but these are at me just like waiting around is making my whole room smell good okay now we'll go to some we're almost done you guys are you feeling sad this is two things left maybe this is the EO hand sanitizer i buy these like multiple them in a little box because i use these so much so they're like organic uhm they don't have like a bunch of bad junk that's in a lot of hand sanitizers and things that you don't want to be putting on your body but their little wipes they smell like lavender I I wipe off everything I wipe off my phone because you don't know how jewelry your phone is you're setting it down it places little germs I wipe it off almost every night I wipe my phone off I wipe my keys to my car the handle off when I'm on an airplane I'm a little germaphobe II I'm wiping off the armrest I'm wiping off the little controller I'm right film off the screen the seat belt buckle everything cuz I'm a little germaphobe II so I go through a lot of this then this is I am so excited you guys this is the old favorite if you guys don't know Priscilla oh no she is one of my dear friends I love her so much um she has these amazing makeup classes she's now I think the global artists for centi beauty she's so amazing and she invented this brush folio a long time ago but now it is being sold at Sephora so you can get them at Sephora and I'm gonna show you guys how you use them so they're this beautiful glossy like Patton glass a brush holder so what you do is you open it up I already put my little brush in there so when you fold it up and travel or take it your brushes stay perfectly safe but when you're at home you fold it or you're on set if you're a makeup artist and then this is harder to do because I like holding it but you pull this guy tight like this then he's like a little stand and you just set him on your table and then you just have all your makeup brushes are sticking up like this or for me what I do is um I used to have one with just all lip liners so I put all my lip liners in here and then all eyeliners and

the hi my name is candy Johnson and I love makeup I love putting it on I love filming it and most days you guys probably think that I were a full face of makeup I don't and most of the time my days are as lares of you I think they are filled with activities such as these [Music] usually you'll find me hanging out with my squad my friends my homies and my friends I mean the toilet and hanging out I mean cleaning sometimes I go shopping and buy shopping I mean waiting in a waiting room those are also used in today's on Instagram I don't close to make a picture but something more like this huh occasionally I even take a glamorous trip to the spa and buy spa I mean the dentist oh well I don't wear one drop of makeup that is until night time rolls around say 10 11 o'clock at night and I decide to film a tutorial I put on a full face of makeup without one place to go so I hope you guys like this makeup you turn up and it's always huge hugs from my house to yours I will see you in the next video and here's a couple other random things you may not know I may have a fancy top and jewelry on but down below I just got jammy pants and slippers on and people probably don't know I posed in ridiculous ways for about two solid minutes to get a good thumbnail for my youtube videos Oh blow kiss you know ultimately get lien on your hand go to sleep what and as much as I love makeup similar on you get home and you get to take off your bra slip into your mermaid tail and your bathtub full of mascaras just kidding but one can dream can't shape put on comfy clothes take off shoes put on slippers that's how it feels to me when I get to tease me I talk about this stuff all the time is if we take the day off I use this so take it much I love this stuff you guys know how to look lip a lip which can be very difficult to get off this stuff is great it gets off liquid lip comic waterproof makeup make it with sunscreen in it crazy color paint it just gets everything off of your face on a side note I also don't always have perfect manicure nails that finger nails all most important hanging I was like a crazy clown I also find taking my eyelashes off to be incredibly rewarding not as rewarding as taking all of my makeup off my entire face but something about the eyelashes coming off it just I just love peeling them off and as a fun fact when I was a little girl a woman came up and told me you look like a little boy that's right she said I look like a little boy from the movie the Black Stallion here is a picture of the little boy here's a picture of me at the same age the lady said I look like the little boy and to this day when I look in the mirror I think hey there you are candy there's that little boy face that you know and love so don't feel bad that you don't go out with a full face of makeup like this because truth be told I don't go out with a full face of makeup like this either and most the time you see me in my full face of makeup it is at night when I've just finished Victoria so if you see me out and about and Target or somewhere I'm probably not going to have any makeup on and probably some kind of sweat or comfortable looking piece of clothing on but come on finesse for a photo and I will take one looking like that little twelve-year-old boy face that you know in love whenever I start my tutorials off because yeah I don't know stay there I love you guys I hope you liked this video as always huge hugs from my house to yours and I will see you in the next video unless you see me on snapchat or Twitter's mostly snapchat I don't have the makeup on so if you want to see more no makeup photos go to the snapchat so there's always that I love you guys and I'll see you the next video bye [Music]

curtains okay now we will move on to anything favorites this you guys is from Maybelline it is a dream velvet soft matte hydrating foundation this stuff is so amazing I was even using it it's a lighter coverage than I like I like pretty full coverage so I was using this as even a primer it just like smooths out your skin and it just makes it look perfect so if you like a lighter coverage this would be perfect for you and even using it as a primer underneath your regular makeup works really well so the dream velvet soft matte hydrating foundation like I don't know just makes your skin look smooth you don't need powder it does look dry and crackly this is just really beautiful so that was one of my my favorite things also another favorite thing so this powder if you guys and follow me on snapchat or Twitter or Facebook or anywhere like that I got to go to Paris you guys and I was so excited I got to go with NYX because I am going to be the host of the NYX face awards this summer which I'm so honored so excited I just love fell in love with Paris so much so I had to go to the Sephora in Paris and I was like hey they've got to have makeup that we don't have there which no they have mostly perfume it was like their stores like 50% perfume and 50% makeup I've never seen this before with so much perfume but everybody smells great they're like you walk down the street there's just men spraying perfume on like Colonna day everybody just smells I'd walk by people like oh my gosh you all smell so delicious here very spray some more stuff on I'll tell you my new perfume favorite also um but I did find one thing and they probably sell this in the US so this is not like a big find I just thought it was like I have to buy it it's from Terry and it's the hyaluronic hydra powder so this is like a said powder and normally when you put setting powders on with like the silica and stuff they just make your skin feel super dry and like I feel like it makes you look more correctly and dry and like I don't know but this is amazing I have been wearing this every day I mean this does say made in France it does say it's from Paris I'm sure you can buy it carry hyaluronic hydra powder this stuff is amazing if you want look like you have a baby perfect skin just set your makeup with this because this was awesome well we're on the topic of fragrance are you ready for this guy dun dun dun dun I love this this is from Moschino and this is called fresh this package is just I just I am in love with mosquitos packed I just love everything they make so as you guys know

longtime fan I everyone that um come to us with PC peek vanilla extreme for ever like ever ever ever that's like my signature fragrance and then this I was like hmm you may be replaced for a little bit so this is a favorite screenshot it right now take a screenshot snapchat it share with all your friends look how cool that is I'll get out of the photo if you want to screenshot it cool looking for here ball okay another one this highlighter from NYX this is ice queen it's been the pro single let me just let me just let me just show you well I don't know if you can see it properly but this highlight is just I'm gonna put a little emoji boom it's me you can put on your eye color down the nose ice queen from NYX highlight and contour Pro singles take a look there that's what it says you snapchat that to take screenshot whatever this stuff is awesome this is one other thing I got some Billy at thesis oh wow this is the height lighting palette solstice this is from sleek makeup which I've never heard of before but look at all of these cool so you get like you get this cream whoops oh my gosh the color just fell out huh that shouldn't happen this color look at that cream highlight you guys then fall out to glue him back on yet you don't supposed to come out what do you suppose I see in there but all of these colors are just like oh my gosh they're just like look at that color you guys I can't even express so I bought this one I bought this one in solstice wait that's the wrong crowd then I bought this other one this lip makeup this is in precious metals do not fall out I got these so this you get three creams and only one shimmer but these creams let me just tell you the love of these creams are just they're just amazing I love these I've been wearing them pretty much every day I love those and then also I'll show you guys my favorite palette every week and then I took with me when I did the piercing so I wrote all of these so this is the tartlet in bloom palette every color that I have on my eye right now is from this palette and I also filmed a tutorial so that'll be coming up soon on this look but I I have I think I have every color on every color in this palette I have on my eye right now and this is true I love this palette I love it it looks beautiful in every color I thought blue green brown you gonna purple eyes this is gorgeous I love this this is a Tarte tartlet in bloom palette if you don't have it and you have like a holiday coming over present ask for this because it's awesome other favorite one that I've been loving the Too Faced sweet peach palette number one it smells like peaches like oh my gosh it just smells like a strawberry shortcake peach doll I had or something and it just smells so good I love these colors are beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful so if you need a couple new pallets those are really good too what else can I show you okay this guy I even loving for contouring it's from pure cosmetics it's the Cameo contour dual ended the light and fell out on the ground and I just threw him away but I didn't really need that anyway so I use this dark one for contouring you'll see in this video for this makeup look I just put it on you go to nose count everything I just love this it is so great I just kind of wish the other end didn't fall out and then another favorite from Too Faced have you guys tried these melted matte lipsticks I've got this one on today it's in me so pretty this color I love it these are so long wearing too I love them but this color is my favorite it's like a nude color and then I put another old favorite where did it go you know how sometimes you just like forget about colors that are really great and that you love world from Mac is one of those this is such an old lip liner but this color it's what I have on right now that's it right there so sometimes when you use nudes it looks like whoa I'm dead I have no lip color then you use this darker color to shade in contour and whirl and this may so pretty love these favorites these are another favorite I've been wearing well I just got this actually in the but it's a instant favorite this is the NYX Cayman frame and this is in black noir but it's not really black it's like a dark brown I put this on my brows if you guys need a cheap dupe for an expensive brow product this NYX one is awesome I may even do a review on this because it is so right okay other favorite I think this was in my old one we're putting in there again the Kat Von D locket concealer this is just amazing I love this stuff it is awesome super pigmented and I love it um okay I was almost very sad because I had to film the intro for this makeover thing and I was like oh my gosh where's my favorite lashes in the world which are flutter lashes and I have tons of them in this is a beautiful lash too this is in Roxy can you see how pretty it's just like a pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty lash this is my favorite the Kim is my favorite I didn't I had to dig through a box this is their old packaging there make the packaging like this anymore to get the Kim lashes because I love them so much other favorite this Marc Jacobs mascara it's got like the fibers in it so it just makes your lashes even before I've got the fake ones on but my real ones look great with this also I love that and I'm almost out of this and it's making me sad the Clinique they're matically different moisturizing lotion okay just gonna sample this just get this trial size after a test or whatever just put it on at night and when you wake up look at your skin I don't know what is in here there's this is like the trial one so I don't know what's in there but it's really amazing I have been loving that this is non like doodoo pranic but

Mercola vitamin b12 energy booster in black Ravens flavor I get this at erawan the health food store and you just spray it on your mouth vitamin B they're gonna help make you the beach shell is gonna make you feel better it's gonna give you energy because you're gonna know I don't get a lot of sleep because I'm editing or doing all kinds of things I just spray this I take this with me when I travel it is amazing again screenshot we're just getting dry that you want add a picture you know snapchat it you can do it do it right now that is awesome and then okay this is not laughing at least cuz then we're gonna go to clothing things but this you guys have heard me talk about this before but this flavor I think is seasonal it's a body butter lady in orange bang you guys if you wanna know what I smell like when I got on the shower this is it it's good for dry skin kraske and scars black spot stretch marks acne eczema I was gonna say eczema eczema it's got no paraffin sulfates colors mineral oil alcohol gluten paraben and it's all vegan organic raw unrefined shea butter and infusion pure natural you get it at Body Butter lady calm my mind at the Melrose trading puffs but you can get it at the body butter lady calm they are very nice people there and I love this stuff so much okay now I'll show you some favorites so oh my gosh you mind all my favorite to lace these cuticle scissors not only can you trim your eyebrows I cut this very shirt with my cuticle scissors I've cut many dresses a tutorial for like the that I wear where I cut the shoulders off I'm gonna have that up I did that because I had a pair of cuticle scissors in my luggage bag and could cut them up so this would be one of my favorite tools also okay now oh my gosh one more shirt let me show you this has been my favorite if you follow me on instagram you probably thought um this Nirvana shirt that's like bleached and torn up with perfect holes which I just loved it it was a t-shirt and then of course with my cuticle scissors I cut the sleeves off again this I got from Miller's room he's from the Melrose trading close to but he's Instagram it's Miller's room I don't know if he should have pictures of these on there cuz these are pretty awesome he has like other bands and things too and then I got this it's like almost like the color of my hair I got this at Zara it's pleather or as people would like to say is his vegan chic leather it's not real leather but this color is amazing and I got that at Zara it was like even not totally in my size another I don't care it's like one of the last ones so I bought it now on - well favorites but not favorite look at this shoe it's a ballerina shoe I love it I feel like a supermodel in it I'm very tall I decided to wear this my last night in Paris and I fell I fell walk totally fine until at the very last minute going about to get into the uber when everybody was behind me and saw there was like one little wobble on the sidewalk and boo candy went down my knee is still bruised and bloody from it I had fishnets on I think that made it worse it like rubbed into my skin I love these shoes but you have to have very smooth even ground like any any bumpy terrain bricks stone a wobble a steep hill I like tiptoed this whole long way cuz there's only one path that wasn't wobbly and pure like what are you doing walking all the way there I'll try not to fall but these are from why are you I love these shoes I totally love them I just wish I didn't fall and this is the letters why why I don't know what I was gonna do there are you um is where these shoes are from I got them from dolls kill actually and oh well should you want my favorite so this bolo tie is one of my new favorites I got this at the Melrose trading post it was just like get vintage jewelry I love it and then I got this hat too I've been looking for a white hat look at how cool this hat is you guys it is a vintage resist all Western hat it was made for burning brands and it looks like running grams I didn't wear it it's a little as a big head I like a giant giant head I like to say it's for my big runs but it's huge and I love this hat I got that at the Melrose training close to snow guys that I got so one of my dreams was to go to a Paris market and then my friends were like you have to go to UM LA we could go shopping they said that's what the cool trendy edgy things are I go there my uber driver didn't really understand a thing and he just took me to like he just kept saying you're a XS Hillary and I was like sure jewelry accessory though I love that and so I get out I go in the store and they only sell wholesale they do not sell to the public and the lady was like well said well said enough for you she likes like telling me to get out so I was like okay every shop was that way so I was like okay I'm just gonna walk down here and maybe I'll find something else and I walked to the end of the street I take a turn what's his there but they pale Asian feeling that get I was like follow my dreams are coming true right now I had no euros to buy anything but I was just looking at the clothes the shoes that the weird like dual apothecary booth with like bottled snakes that were preserved in eyeballs and weird things and then like Yvonne she shoes and chandeliers and just everything I wanted to buy vintage Louboutins suitcases that were so beautiful and just decorative but then I saw this little crown in front of an antique store and he took credit gown so I think he was like 15 dollars and I was like can I buy him please so this was the only thing I got the flea market I loved him I don't know what I'm gonna do with him but I just I love him I carefully brought him on the plane with me like a little baby and so those were all my favorites and Paris would probably be my favorite it's like a dream they're like oh my gosh just I just ate so much bread and butter and was so great I was alone like most of the time but I didn't care I just ate dinner by myself I walked around the city by myself two pictures I blog that filmed and I'll put a blog and all that stuff too um but what was it I even had to buy a camera when I was there because I was like I didn't bring a camera because none of my charges I realize I can have them like the morning I kept my I'm gonna take them and then when I got there was like I have to film here and take pictures here so I wouldn't buy the camera and this is what I'm filming on right now actually because my regular camera a filmer battery has died so now good thing I bought that camera I hope you guys love this do you have any favorites were any of these your favorite things or want to be your new favorites comment below if you are excited about the favorites are the things you guys want me to add in favorites like food favorites other things like that let me know in the comments below because I would like to know -

look at all the hair I just cut off on the floor with these portable kitchen scissors hi guys it's candy and today we're going to do project cut my hair and I know you may be thinking you just post a video saying how you just got your extensions dyed this beautiful color well let me tell you first so my hairstylist called her distributor and registers that oh you should try these new hair extensions they're really great and they're better than the last one so my hairstyle ordered them we put them in my hair and we realized they are horrible they're naughty they're tangley it's like having doll hair like they just start teasing and getting all knotted and scraggly and really crazy-looking so I haven't been able to like wear them down and look pretty because they look kind of frizzle II um but then if I walk like 20 steps they get all knotted and crazy so we've ordered new ones but in the meantime I think I'm just gonna like cut part of the dance off until she's dying the new ones right now as we make this video so I'm just gonna cut these off and also so you know my good scissors are packed away in my moving truck these are just some pretty much antique shears my mom had that I don't know whose hair anybody cuts with this but I did go to cosmetology school to cut hair um what we're just gonna do like this is not going to be technical I'm just cutting this stuff off because I'm getting new hair tomorrow so I didn't care really how it looks but I will show you how you start first we have to move my mom's bathroom rug so we don't get that a mess I'll use this giant comb so this is what we're going to do I will show you the length of my real hair this hair this is my real hair link so pretty I don't want to cut any of my real hair so pretty much right here we're good with cutting so let's go ahead and start I really don't know how horrible these scissors are wait do not want to accidentally cut any real real hair because I am trying to grow it out I think that's it are you ready we are going to cut this business off we're just going to slide it down just little here's the first snipping and I really hope that wasn't any of my real hair there these scissors are horrible okay that looks really bad so that's great these scissors are 1,000% awful this is a mere thumbnail right here you ready and me yep you've cut that guy off we're going to cut this scale I'm not even sectioning it I don't even care really piece scissors are the worst oh my gosh I wish I had my shears that are in my I have razors I have all the tools but not how you should cut here at all look at this I'm not even checking nothing we just cut this business this fried junk off oh my life is feels better already that a couple stragglers I would almost be better off with kitchen scissors at this point these are like the worst scissors ever wanted it is kind of my hair oh okay I am going to finish up this chopping you know what I kind of like this link there know that I see you told me head I'm going to finish this up and make it look better and then I'll come back and show you the finished product I kind of like it okay it actually worked out that the kitchen scissors or better than the hair scissors these are still bad but I don't care because I better go to an appointment right now you doesn't even matter what it looks like because it's literally only going to be like this for maybe some hours is not how you normally cut hair so do not replicate this technique at home on the back yep so this is as good as my five minute home haircutting is going to get it was fun as like if I'm going to take all these out I'm just going to cut them out real fast before I actually do and here is my shorty hair this is soap whoa the back is super crooked where in the world was this guy hiding you are out of here buddy and again this this is not haircutting techniques this is not how you should be cutting hair but this is how I am making this work gosh where are these hairs coming from where did you come to this is not how you should cut hair but this is my new short hair do you guys like it let's see can we flip it to the side yep we can still flip it to this side and it's short what do you guys think it's not so bad for like a crazy bad haircut with literally with kitchen scissors haha I don't know I think I'm a I don't know you will see if I leave it this way or or not but I kind of think it so I just want to do this and like swish it around because it feels so short and swishy what do you think do you guys like it so I just cut my hair off

and now what are we gonna do Nikki we're going to try and bring the effect of the bottom getting a little bit lighter so we're going to actually go a little darker on the roots and see if we can kind of give it that what are we gonna put in there just that pramana red again yeah so it's like if you put the red on a white wall versus red on the red is Alyssa with deeper and darker I can maybe still have a woman Ramos yes that's a good now you try it could make this I love this though this is so cute you can't attend a job look how much straighter very bad I'm just doing a sideways pull and cut don't do that at home nikki is going to rinse me out she just did ombre so she lightened the ends darken the roots what did you put here Nikki on the roots it has six are are shades cream which we're not the red pin one I reckon yeah and then did you put the probe on or red back on yep then after I get that on your zone one and then I shout out in the Parana red right behind that uh-huh and then the third shade is mixed with the Pravana red and the two cute coral and then we just leached the end a little or lighten that every day ten volume on your ends whoo and now we're going to rinse it all out and see what we look like yeah I'm gonna hold your end down so there mommy to help should I help hold stuff you can't ruin your beautiful nail on thing I thought this day might it oh they're

hi guys so I'm going to show you my most used products of all of 2015 so they're like favorites but even more because I use them so much I either bought them again or have used them multiple times or about multiple of them from last year so we're gonna start we're gonna start in different areas so we're gonna start in face products lip products eye products tools hair and then random miscellaneous things also so the first thing we will start off with with most-used because I bought I have purchased four bottles three bottles or four bottles of this this is the Clinique beyond perfecting foundation which is amazing you cannot apply it with the wand like it says I'll be like a full review on it later if you guys want me to comment that below but I just put it on here I spread it with my Beauty Blender it gives the most perfect coverage it is like Hydra not like drawing like a lot of like really good coverage foundations are and I just love it I love this Clinique beyond perfecting it is amazing I love this stuff then for concealers I've kind of got like two so this is the RCA this is really like foundation but I use this for like highlighting or like a concealer also and I have I've used so many pallets of this this year especially for like my costume tutorials where I do a lot of contouring and highlighting this is the RC Navy k-11 this is the one that I use the most of ek 11 I love this it has great color where other contour shades this was designed for TV and film and it's been around since 1963 so some of the newer brands that come out with like contour palettes there - red there - Orange you don't want to look like a glowing oompa-loompa you just want to look like you actually have just like contour and glow and um and I really love this palette for this another one that I've been using a lot towards the end of 2015 is the Kat Von D lock-it concealer it has great great coverage and this is medium 22 if anybody wants more color I was using an essential most probably one of the most used products of the year was my Beauty Blender tsp wash don't look at him but is a Beauty Blender you not get the flawless foundation you couldn't even put self tanner so many things with the beauty blender put your powder I love love love love love my beauty blend up okay this guy is so used you're gonna see this is hoola from benefit look at I'm down to like the bottom of the little barrel I got a new one too somewhere but I use hoola so much you can use as eyeshadow color - that's beautiful so hoola from benefit okay one other most used things for my lip it is the treat lip balms these jumbo organic ones this is marshmallow cream I have it in confetti cake and soft butter cream and hot chocolate I have all of the flavors gingerbread I have all of it had these everywhere I put them on my lips I put them on my eyes or so you don't get wrinkles like at night I I have so many of these this is a one of most use lip product more than lipstick because I put this on all the day long all the night long I love this stuff then for blush these guys I hit pretty much used these like all the year long this is well dressed from Mac and love how they look almost the same but this is like a little more brighter pink and I just it gives you like a natural flush without looking like woah any these cheek color glowing it's they're just really pretty like flush of color colors umm these I've used a lot and I got these are the Mac Pro store I don't know if they are at all the Mac stores or not but they are the match master concealer sticks in 1.0 which I use for highlight because he's like way lighter than my skin you can like highlight oh my gosh I just bonk it on my nose I did um yeah um so this is for highlight and then I have matchmaster consider a point 5 I have like a million of these colors actually different shades of darkness to come to a me face so those that use a lot for face this is another guy for face well these end up Marilyn Monroe tweezerman tweezers but they're by Betsey Johnson the collection of tweezerman tweezers these are the best tweezers in the world the tweezer man tweezers I have him everywhere I take one in my purse the travelease is guys which he's not in my purse I must have taken him that's how I lose him but the tweezer man they're my favorites now whoops oh my gosh most use product okay this guy is going to be a little pricey this has probably been I would say this is my most used powder for my entire career and beyond on YouTube so for like over seven years now this has been my most used powder it is the lemare that's how they're in translucent you want the one with no color this is a little pricey I think he's a little pricey but he will last you forever but you may go get one at the drugstore and you're gonna run out in a couple months this will last you like a year you could share it with a friend just cut half put some in a ziploc bag that's how I travel with mine this powder is amazing so if it is higher priced one but I always say spend money on your foundation in your powder then you can use cheap drugstore eyeliners lip liners blush all those kind of invest in a good foundation powder and concealer because that's where the skin is deepest section so he's definitely most used okay now let's go to lip land I'm gonna show you the three most used liquid lip colors that I've used all of the year I do the other colors but these are the most used so first we have our classic red this is American doll from EE and then these other two colors are also from her as well this is milkshake and lovely and I like to wear these say that but lovely and then I put a little milkshake in the center which is the combo I've got one today so these are my most used liquid lip colors I just haven't I just wasn't a big lipstick we're in 2015 I just like the D stay on all day long and they don't gonna mess with it the rest of the day but then favorite lip liners so these these are the guys cherry red lip liner I have so many of these everywhere in case I lose them there's like two in my makeup bag one in the counter one in the bathroom probably one in my purse if you don't own cherry red lip liner from Mac go and buy it it's the best red lip liner ever then these are my nude guys so sore of course I have bought him so many times this year so sore from Mac he's just like the perfect nude like a nude plummy brown color and then it blew up about popular after Kylie Jenner said to used it but I'm sure a lot of you guys like me use it way before her it just made it really hard to buy it because it's always sold out and then I love naked from Urban Decay this is my other like favorite nude color it's just like it's a little warmer than store it's like a little more peachy than sore and these urban kids they go on smoother than the max they cut they really do glide on like the name said they do just like soup on your lip and then this this is 7c from Make Up For Ever this is like my favorite and you'll see in the color it's a little deeper so I have that on too to give like really good definition to the lip you could wear this with pinks rose nudes I just love this color 7c from Mac now oh I'll give you a good drugstore dupe to your Danna in rockin rose this is a pretty good dupe for the Make Up For Ever seven-seat do you see him this is the jordana rock and rose down here on the bottom and then also Revlon Colorstay in nude I'm gonna just put him on there too they're almost like identical all of those three so you can use those guys too for a drugstore dupe for those full so now let's go to I town okay most use liquid lip liner of all it is the Make Up For Ever ink liner the reason I like this guy is because it's matte it's totally matte I don't like a lot of the eyeliners that are real shiny they look like just blah see I like a black matte color and it's got this little pointy tip guy you could use an angle brush to apply it to but I have gotten so many of these this year because I always lose one so the ink liner from Make Up For Ever my favorite black pencil where are you I just said you here oh is the 24/7 glide-on perversion from Urban Decay this is so solid black and inky and stays in the waterline and stays which is so so black like other blacks are like grey black or not black enough this is the blackest I love this coat I used to love feline and carbon from Mac this is like smoother and so ultra sooty deeper darker black I love I have almost more of these interior planners everywhere um another one most used of course my pearl-handled tart eyelash curler they make my different designs every year but I just love this pearl one I just feel so blabbers when I curl my lashes with it I love this okay this one wait a minute this is not what he looks like this is the travel one this is the Tarte lights camera lashes this is the regular size plus I have a travel one in my purse most used mascara I have gone through so many of these this year because I love this mascara it is just gives you long full lashes that almost make it look like you have false lashes and I love them speaking of false lashes let's go into my favorite false lash of the Year hands down even the year before probably the these are the flutter lashes from Kim okay one and these fell out but look at these beautiful babies when you put these on your eye instantly but it's normally called the glam eyeshadow palette and it don't in the blue too much but I use all of these neutrals and it's super pigmented it's for theater TV movies so you have more pigment in these professional ones then drugstore ones that have like a lot of filler so they're not gonna have a heavy payoff and they're not gonna last as long because these are filled with more pigment that's why they're more expensive it's cheaper to just put filler and a little pigment where the more higher-end professional ones are more pigment so I just I use all these colors off and this black is so inky and black I just I love this pout so if you want it's a bad night I believe it's called the glam eyeshadow palette and what you can get with this these other guys I have used these so much already and I got them towards the end of 2015 but I've worn them everyday since then first off it is the the Tarte tartlet palette these are all matte colors and I love them I love every single color in his palette and I wear at least three of these a day I love this palette then my other one would be of course the Gwen Stefani palette not only did she pick out all of these colors to be in here because she wears them I love all of them it's these two palettes these after the Ben Nye I haven't used him because I've just used these two pallets like everyday cuz I love I love both these pallets if I were to tell you to get pallets just go buy these - they're amazing you will love them now let's go on to eyebrows well he's kind of with eyes actually so for a little bit I used the UM the Urban Decay brow as I think was called um eyebrow pencil but I really for the most part of this year last year since these came out the UH Nastasia dip brow pomade in dark brown and I use it with a little angle brush that they come with because other bloggers weren't too fluffy and you can't leave a wibbly-wobbly line but there's like the piece of baby hair dude it's like give you like the straightest application now should we go to a hair town I'll show you a skin one that we'll use a lot so this guy is the Shiki borge therapy advanced formula I have dry skin and I use this I just buy so many bottles of this a year it's ridiculous buy get it at Whole Foods it doesn't really smell great it says fragrance free you're not gonna smell like I just spray perfume on some who cares if it doesn't smell good but I just like to feel moisturize and this hydrates your skin it's for advanced formula for super dry skin it's got three boosts revokes ruie boosts I don't know how you say that word that but that's in there okay other most used this is Gillette Venus razor is my most used it looks like I just was in a windstorm I love this razor so much it's got cushiony he doesn't have a purpose being here but I use him every day that I take a shower okay for hair products as we all know or you may not know this is extension this is not my real hair my real hair is here I really it's getting along but it's not as long as all this hair so I use just for extensions this brush I got the beauty supply because it does help detangle these extensions that like want to turn into big knotted message right away other most-used look at the size of this right on brush it's from TG s factor and just gets my hair super straight super fast when I blow-dry my hair got this at the beauty supply Hey look I got even two of them this is how much I use them duelling teasing brushes this is the Marilyn brush oh this is the old teasing at monroe brush a one is Marilyn ones Monroe how weird they must have had like a company that got divided but look at I'll just give you a sample of the teasing power that these create look at this hair no we're gonna tape him down but you can definitely look at that volume these teasing brushes are amazing so you can get the teasing you Monroe or the Marilyn rush Marilyn Monroe get them both like me okay then my other most used oh whoops I forgot some products this is the GHD flat iron which I use every day that I need to straighten to fix my hair this is my little hair buddy best friend the GHD and he came out in this fun periwinkle color that I I just want to lick it a little bit love this um hang on got some more things other most use product my mother made this pillowcase for me that is satin and this makes your hair it's just like smooth so your hair slips on it if you use cotton or silk or something else it's gonna be sticky and you're gonna wake up with ugly or crazier hair mess hair and this also helps smooth out your face so you don't get wrinkles so my mom can't make them for the world but I know you can Google where to get a satin pillowcase because like bad for your skin but for your hair okay hang on we're going for one more nope or three more Regis okay other most used hair box I have gotten two bottles of this this year it is a Pravana natural evolution haircare intense therapy leave-in treatment oh my god the hair it's you shake it up shake it up and you spray it throughout your hair not only did your hair smell delicious this smells so good I wish it was perfume and it's vegan gluten free they don't mind it for cancer this stuff is great I get this at my hair salon the hair girl little hair um my friend Nikki so I guess it there the other one this is amazing if you have thin hair because I have totally thin hair without these extensions it looks very thin this is the serie film maximized dense effects from red kin sierra fill maximize and I buy the travel size because because it's expensive it says this one is 1650 for his little bottle this is why I buy this size um but this is amazing you put this in your hair it makes your hair look like thicker like by nine hundred percent or five hundred percent or something on the bottle it claims that your hair looks crazy thicker and it works it is amazing if I create these fibers that make your hair look so full of dick it's like if I don't use this on my cook ugly but then I put this on I'm like oh look at my luxurious hair I love it ok is that the end no it is not the end I'm gonna show you my most

I wear them everyday so I could just watch them more with the other pair half I love these pants from happiness brand I love them and my other most used thing which will bring us to the end of the most products for 2015 it's my ten-foot phone charging cable because I can't do much with a dead phone I love this thing I can be so far away from the wall I could be sitting on a chair in the middle of the room I could go on a little bit of a walk and I am still charged I also use my iPad charger because it charges my phone up like 20 times faster that's not actual factual number it's just like

she doesn't know it yet I know okay so I have some fun question okay ask you yeah are you ready I'm so ready okay there's like they're not very serious okay okay okay see a star thoughts really super easy okay what is your favorite color oh that's a good question yellow I like yellow too because it makes me happy yeah yeah and I like this turquoise yeah I love turquoise too I love you I've got yellow and trick I do like on my nail there's something similar between us like about you know people always tell me that they're like you sound just like you're way more hyper and way more like in a good mood than I am but no probably cuz I just women excited okay it is exciting you know I feel right now I got that makeup how cool is this I don't think this is so cool thank you the magic oh my gosh is this so cool did you get to help pick out colors I did not a thing yeah like we just did yeah because the thing is about doing this project was I literally obviously been obsessed with makeup since eyelid yeah was born yeah me like I don't even know why they just like also I think you know like discovering like even before I saw like old movies or anything I just was so into like my girlfriend and me her mom was like really like had so much makeup we'd run up a school and be like extra moms we can play with it and we would be like Mary Carrie and I will do like make up Mary Kay me yeah like full yeah action we have a whole thing and so I just always loved it I always wanted to do my own collection once I started designing but it just never happened you never did any makeup thing before huh no and I mean I did some stuff like but not making not designing yeah and so with these girls the urban decay girls they're just so like they're Orange County girls like me and they're like my age and they built this whole brand off like from the ground up like around the exact same time I was you know doubt so it's like this whole synchronicity and like the way they did it is so authentic and so like there is very similar to mine and everything's to the left and kind of punk and like edgy and like so it just seems like perfect timing now like now it all makes sense why it never happened until now so working with them like I didn't even know like how do we how do we narrow it down like how do we focus you know like what are your favorite eyeshadow colors or how I pick them out so anyways yeah I didn't know where to begin and they're just so good so they were like let's do a palette and yeah a lot of it a lot of the hardest part was probably just like editing like yeah narrowing it down cuz there's so much well what I wanted to do was do like my like it has nothing to do with anyone's very selfish it's like exactly what it's what I wear once my it cuz they'd be like what do you wear like like that is what I wear this is what I wear and so like I wanted to do like and I don't wear a lot of color like I'm really not that adventurous and I mean like I do the same makeup since ninth grade and but that's why you look good throughout all the years you're not gonna have like that is so mm whatever but I've learned oh I think my biggest like gift has been like the success like through the successes like meeting amazing talented people they're so good and then I evolved you know to me so but this palettes basically like that would be my basic like I like eye shadow on the handed you know I'm saying and then I would wear like that in the center like to bust it out and if I really want to go Sparkle I put that on top of the whole thing and then I would use this as a crease and then these two to even go heavier in the crease and these two for underneath and then that's like my highlighter and then that's like the ultra highlighter right under the brow and this is sort of like a you know maybe at night if I wanted to do like a shimmer I could totally use that later that's what the highlighter is and then so then I wanted to like basically do like my crazy color so my crazy colors like if I wasn't wearing this would be like my base would be the gold or the pink and then I want it like I use the Navy for like if I want to blend out like the top like of a line or like a key line here or even to go over like some kind of a cat eye I would use a navy and then this is like really amazing for like a smoky eye which I don't do a lot and they're not good at but I also use this to blend out a top line and then the great same thing just to describe kind of basic colors here and you have to have a black and they have to have a black so and this blue looks really good is around this is really beautiful this blue and so anyways that's it it's super simple and this packaging is like so glam I love it it kind of like I wanted to do something that represented like it's hard to have like Harajuku lovers which is sort of like my like kind of kauai pop art yeah younger ready and then there's like the other side to me so I wanted to do something that kind of like to find the whole thing and I had this piece in my house it's like this old like 70s sixties like these like these big circles and it just and I'm like really into like black and white and in polka dots and stripes and just kind of retro but modern yeah so sort of like futuristic but throwback at the same time so I feel like I'm with retro yeah so that's what we came up with after all it's good look like just like jewelry on your table it's it did it turned out there I mean it was a really fun process and you know I got really enjoy like I have enjoy sharing it and wearing it and all that stuff but it was really about the journey of it like working with them and like discovering like trying out the makeup like it's hard like it is really hard because you you it's like permanent like this is the color like I don't want it I know I don't want one color in here to not use genji like I'm like ooh I wish I could replace that one yeah so it was hard and I'm really fun yeah how long ago did you guys start working on it hey Lisa how long did we start working on it oh wow two years ago why would I have the baby whoa you know what it but it was also yeah it is yeah so I don't know oh we're one minute oh my gosh that's not enough time for my rapid-fire questions you are a little cowboy today I just realized I am look account that's well this is really cuz

so I encourage you to stalk me on the Internet only if you're chasing me down the street in my car that would be weird if I see you peeking into the window of my house that would be creepy but if I post in for you to look at on the internet that's body beans now let's get started with breaking news in the Beauty room so first off from benefit we have the barrel double the best lip color and liner in one so as you can see here the tip in dual colored you're supposed to have the lip liner on one in hi Sandy it is yourself you're out here in the ring on the fourteenth weight breaking news some packages have just arrived with new beauty products that are just about to hit the market we're going to step inside and show you the content of those packages right now okay we are in the studio live and what was in there but the Anasazi value VIP package of six brand-new liquid lip colors first up is the color clover which is this deep lavender shade next up we have this beautiful antique rose shade in poet followed by a rosy mauve color called days next we have the shade current this shade tulip which is a deep hot pink almost slightly looking red I've now turned on my wider cooler light to see them under this lighting and last but not least the bold color in Requiem this green shade is not for the faint-hearted and there you have this fixed new shades from on a sakya of Beverly Hills next up from Urban Decay the stackable Pro artistry palette the palettes come with a clear magnetic lid which can be removed you simply take the lid and place it on the bottom when you want to stack them on top of each other and the more you snacks is simply remove the lid and slide it onto the bottom the engineering behind this is amazing they magnetically stick together and you have a whole entire cube of high shadow palettes but not only can you see the front shade of the color but you can also see behind with the name you simply pop the eyeshadow out of the maintain slip it into the foam padding and you have stackable eyeshadow palettes get ready for the cabin upon unit horn highlighter just kidding it's actually called the Neo limelight highlighter but I think it should be called uniform highlighter this lavender and this lighter shade you look at them just on my fingers they're already amazing next up is this heaviness on neo highlighter this is amazing it goes from slightly lighter on the left side to a deeper gradient on the right I'm going to take the darker shade and apply it right here and the lighter shade beneath the sad part is you can't even tell how beautiful it looks in a real like hard what new brushes do we have here they're both weighted and so amazingly balanced in your hands first we have the cabin upon Camino highlighter brush and look at this curve it's going to perfectly place the highlighter onto your face then there is we come upon angled foundation brush I can't even tell you how amazing you feel in your nail and what is this laughs Sinhalese mac and betty boop boop we do this is a beautiful matte shade red it called Betty Boop red totally matte it was just like cherry lip liners one of my favorites from Mac I absolutely amazed being one or two of these items if you follow me on snapchat that's it for us in the embossing station area studio now back to yourself in the other room and as you put it here I'm guessing you're supposed to shade it in my only concern with this is I like a good pencil lip liner because it is a thicker consistency and this is more like a lipstick in a different color not sure how I feel about this yet but I am going to play with it it comes in a myriad of colors I'm a little old fashioned lip liner down so I will put these to the test and see what I think next Kylie Jenner has come up with some amazing things for Valentine's Day she actually signed to candy from Kylie on the bottom it's Valentine's and head-over-heels these colors are beautiful this is Valentine which is a beautiful pink color kind of looks similar to what some might look a little bit and a matching lip liner in the same shade then she also have head over heels which is this for me color that you will see here in the macking lip liner as what you didn't stop there with the lip colors but there is this little mini lip kit it's matte liquid apricot Malibu hi name is Posie K head over heels and Mary Jo K in these little mini eyes which is oh hello candy is handy girls live in the bathroom I apologize right now we're about to witness a live base washing but they can buy for candy D girls a fitting

it totally dark so I started weeping and slept with the iMac and then I lost and I was like I got worn these my Mac so I ordered like 10 from Amazon to see which one would be best and I got all different ones I got this leopard one because I thought hey leopard is fun and trendy this one is terrible it was not long enough to stretch around my head peirong have got a gigantic head and then I got this bug-eyed one from Brookstone because I was like ooh that it looks like it's you know padded and cushiony this is not as comfortable and let me just show you the back if you're bulimic who catered this for children is this IMAP for children because it doesn't keep my head then I got this one we Buffy the Bucky this is the best one but again I sleep with this every night I'm not joking

then I'm going to take reflection again with my fluffy brush and I'm going to sweep this on the outer corner of the eye and up into the crease and up towards the brow then I'm going to take a flatter fluffy brush and a mixture of chessboard and I'm going to tap it into reflection to lighten him up I'm going to go right into the crease with this color for a little bit to depth blend it right into the crease and then just kind of blend up and then down into the outer part of your eye I like to take my fluffy brush that doesn't have anything on it and help blend the color away also then I'm

excess and I'm just going to press him right into our lash line basically just where our lashes like grow out of your eye and then that's just going to give them a punch of color and they'll be dark

hey guys it is your good friend candy here and I'm here with what could be that how to survive life series and this is going to be how to have more style and more confidence because this was something that you guys asked me for a lot so I want to go over five key points that I think can totally help develop your style and give you more confidence in your style and in in life in general so the first one is have fun getting dressed think like a kid when you get dressed when you're a kid you would wear whatever you like whether it was like a Batman costume with rain boots for example like for me I used to roll my socks down like doughnuts around my ankles and my parents were like stop doing that can you stop rolling socks around all looks kind of dumb and I'm like no I love my donut socks and I would just roll my socks down like doughnuts around my ankles I thought it was so cool I don't know how I walked they'd be like puffy and like the socks with like puffs and hit each other sometimes but I loved my style I wore this purse that was a tennis shoe all the time think back to your kid if you don't know what your style is what do you gravitate towards what do you like or think is fun or those colors or prints or patterns or do you love cowboy boots or what is it fits in your style that you love and go to that thing that you think is fun life is too short to not have fun when you get dressed I mean if you have a job and you have to dress or wear uniform whatever - all those kind of things you got to do that but when it's your free time and you can dress however you want have more fun getting dressed and I feel more confident when I'm wearing something that I love that may not feel like I fit in with everybody and any of those times in my life where I felt like oh I should dress more this way so I fit into this scenario or this event I'm going to I have hated what I've worn I did not feel like me and um it is always better to go with whatever you are happiest in that is your style number two don't be afraid to stand out and be different this world is not meant for us to all look like robots all of the same all have the same style and no matter what social media says because everybody's so quick to make fun of everybody or anything that's different do not change anything about you your personality your style the way you want to wear your hair your makeup anything because somebody leaves you a negative comment about something we're saying they don't like it or they think this or that you be you and you stand out that way and don't listen to them because you probably don't want to dress how they dress or how they would do their makeup or hair anyway so don't change who you are for anybody else be that pink tree standing out in a forest green you are unique individual and you should dress that way too everything should have the stamp of your personality in your style just like your home you decorate your home in your unique style of the things you love and you wanted to feel and look like do the same thing when you get dressed don't feel like I gotta look like everybody else because that's look popular that's what trendy that's how that's what everybody should look like no be you and be unique and be different be something different that is just your stamp if that's my style next thing is style is not the same thing as being trendy style is liking something regardless of whether it's on trend you just like it I have worn mixed match earrings for years that maybe not on trend but I don't care I like it or whatever it is you like this is a little bolo tie it might look like Colonel Sanders to somebody I like the bolo tie and I think it looks cute was Micallef Lodge dress I like camouflage I thought this tie is fun so I wear it am I gonna care so he's like oh yo put Colonel Sanders oh you look like you're hiding in a forest were you sure I don't care what they say I like it and I'm getting dressed for me I'm not getting dressed for everybody else to be like oh would you wear this out - do you like it would you wear this outfit you approve this outfit you could never get dressed because everybody's gonna have some opinion on some things just own what you have and be confident in it owning your own style how do you own your own style this is hard because especially when you're younger I know a lot of kids are afraid to go to school and then you're going to make fun of it you don't wanna wear weird things that people could make fun of let me tell you right now the most awesome creative people that I know we're all teased and made fun of in school if you get teased make fun of you should be like patting yourself on back lip yes because I'm different and unique and creative and that always invites more people to criticize you if you want to dress like everybody else well so nobody makes fun of used to you're safe that's not style does not creativity that's being afraid of people if you have a weird thing that you want to do that's different with your hair do it let that be your style that sets you apart and makes you that's your signature something own it with confidence I could go anywhere I would wear a try Baggs if I had to to go to in a bid and if I owned enough to be like this is garbage bag chic I would do it and if something like or more trash bags I'd be like no this is sheet this is on trend you don't know it just own whatever it is that you're going to do and don't let anybody derail you I remember in high school I got made fun of all of the time like I remember I wore these white Doc Marten boots that had like pointy toes and then I wore these red jeans I don't know if when you guys know cross colors are but they were like really big a baggy and they would came in all kinds of bright colors they're kind of like hip-hop eg pne's and I wore my bright red bag pants and then my Doc Martens and my pants were rolled up but they're still like gigantic baggy and then I remember what kind of shirt I wore and then I remember these girls were like oh my gosh where do you go shopping and they said it kind of just like that I remember I was like why are you making fun of my clothes I'm not making fun of your outfit and I would never wear what you have on I did not say that out loud of course I will get teased for all kinds of things even to being an adult I'd be teased by my friends or peeling like oh why did you wear it out you cut that shirt yourself why are you wearing my bandana and they're like my friends and I'd be like why do you make up on me I'm gonna make it funny of you wearing your plain old t-shirt everywhere so own your own style the more confident you are nobody can mess with you if you're like I like this and I'm wearing it I don't care what you say nobody can mess with you when you do that and this is the final and fifth one do not care what other people think and this is where I'm gonna give you some special advice from some people one being my grandma who's 95 that I love so much and she's been through a lot of horrible things in life and I remember when I was younger she always told me if anybody makes fun of what you're wearing you just tell them just be glad you don't have to wear it and that became something that was so powerful to me when anybody made fun we look Oh where'd you get both pairs it's not really a shirt or whatever they say and I'm like look just be glad you don't have to wear it I'm getting dressed for me I'm not being dressed for you don't want to wear my clothes so have that confidence and own it if it's wacky if it's weird if it's if your style is more chic and more refined and whatever it is that you like wear that and own it and if you want to have fun with the crazy piece life is too short to not have fun if you want to have crazy colored hair or you don't just live on the edge just try new things you life is going to feel richer when you try more things I love big clunky jewelry and statement pieces and I've collected vintage jackets for years those are things that I wore now I've worn 10 years ago I still love wearing them it's not like I have to fit in with whatever is trendy and popular and and then nothing's out of style and you know six months or whatever don't trace chase trends chase style and also something that you get with age too like the older you get the more you develop your style and what you like and and you get less afraid to care what other people think I wish I could have told my high school self now like don't care what anybody says wear whatever you want and I did dress a little weird I'd wear like a lot of polyester man pants and like these vintage men's sweaters from the thrift store and I loved it they were not flattering in any way like make my butt look like way bigger than what like these polyester grandpa pants I love them and Adam so many different plaid patterns um just like other styles I've had that I've you know cut things up weird or like I remember I cut these pants and I'd cut him up and they look like the Scarecrow's pants job I look back and think about it and I wore these to makeup job that I had as a makeup artist and I thought they were like the coolest pants ever and now I look back it was fun that I was just creative and I didn't care and I'm not really taking pictures on those pants also but that's part of life is you're gonna have those moments where you're like oh my gosh what was I wearing what did I do but as long as you're always having fun remember think of life as this is your this is your runway this is your stage have fun getting dressed I think the art of getting dressed and putting together an outfit is so I think it's more fun than wherever I'm going dressed up sometimes like I love coming up with like what accessorize like how can I accessorize this what can I put on how many bracelets can I pile on what kind of socks can I wear with that work or fishnet tights those be fun with biker boots and with that long flannel dress or whatever it is so I want you guys to have more fun and also if you are someone judging other people all the time like on there it's like why would they wear that oh my gosh stop being so close-minded and be more open-minded and encourage other people for their creativity we need to celebrate each other's individuality you want people looking just like you everywhere it'd be like a world full of boring robots I love seeing inspiration even if it's not my style or how a dress I love seeing people's creativity the most that's what I love out of the judge for like the season finale on how do I look um one year and I remember it was so hard for me because they would bring these people in and be like oh say what you don't like about their outfit I even if it wasn't my style I appreciated their creativity so much I didn't ever want to say anything bad about them I mean even wonder she made these shoes out of like horse shoes like real horse horse shoes and made them look like horse feet with this like fake pink fur it was I wouldn't wear that myself but I thought that was so cool that she made these shoes and she would wear them out in the street and I was like I love your style I love your in Tibet individuality I love your creativity be somebody that encourages other people and cheer them on no matter how crazy or wacky their style is and don't tear other people down it's the great creative people to encourage other people to be more creative I'll leave you guys some of my favorite quotes I don't know if you guys know who iris apfel is but she's 93 years old and she's this fashion icon that she just dresses with his crazy jewelry and he's awesome style and your big glasses and I love her and a lot of people always say like oh less is more or less is more and her saying is more is more and less is abour and I love that because I always feel like after like tone down everything so I don't seem crazy but I want to be that lady that's good a dress crazy when I'm old and have necklaces staff to hear and on my arms and maybe I'll have crazy hair different colors till I'm a hundred in something but be that person that loves the creativity I love hunting at vintage stores thrift stores I don't like looking at magazines or what's popular or on trend I'll go for a little bits of pieces of inspiration or you can take you know whatever is on trend you could take little here and there and mix it in and throw it into your style but always make sure that it's you start developing something that's unique as your personality and just have fun and do not care at all what anybody says because I'll be cheering you on saying you wear that you so you own it and if somebody tells you something about your outfit because somebody's always gonna say it I get stuff all with all the day long every outfit I wear I get hurt like you told something but I just hear my grandma's voice telling me and I imagine telling that person just be glad you don't have to wear it I'm wearing it and I like it so nobody got a problem with it I love you guys so much I hope this encourage you leave me in the comments below

hey guys it's candy and I have a new updated skincare routine and show you all the products I'm using and I don't have any makeup on so you can see all my skin in this video - I you can also see some weird little scratches I got I was testing out like this DIY face scrub recipe which just scratch my face basically so a lot of times you'll see things online and they'll be like oh do this at home and it's really not very great for your skin so I will not be sharing that with anybody else to do that but I am I show you guys what I use on my skin to watch boys dried scrub all that kind of stuff to keep your skin dewy and youthful and healthy and hydrate not stuff so basically every day I will wash my face in the shower and then I wash it again at night to wash all the makeup off because you don't want to sleep in the makeup it stretches out your pores bacteria stuff grows in there and that's not good but sometimes I'm lazy sometimes they don't even do that and I don't care if I get is it I'm just tired - drier but I will show you guys what I watched was so um in this little this little travel bottle you could put olive oil or grapeseed oil um those I like to use to actually or you could use face cleansing oil if you want to but anytime you use a facial cleansing oil you need to remove that oil you need to use something after because those oils um sometimes they will just stay on the skin and not really clean everything as deeply as you want so um I make sure that you use a washcloth if you're not gonna use a cleanser after use a washcloth and you can really scrub it I always use a washcloth with my face I never just put a cleanser on and splash off you have to get something like scrubby to like clean the junk off of your skin so I will take this almost up especially around the eyes I use this for eye makeup because oily products will remove other oily products like eyeliner or mascara all that kind of stuff um and then for another cleanser I have a couple other ones I like to use where'd they go I don't know how you say this the new the nude multi cleanser it kind of has a little bit of scrubbing particle so it were like really scrubs and buffs your skin also and then anything you can use the scrub you could even use like baking soda make a little mixture with that in some water and you can use that as a face scrub a couple times a week if you want also and then I got this this bliss micro magic spa powered micro do treatment it's got volcanic pumice and soothing aloe it's really gritty and I just love it to like get in and scrub out all the junk in my pores so I love this I go a little crazy sometimes I do this everyday at night you could do it a couple times a week for sure and then let's see to moisturize so that's for cleansing up in that way now for moisturizing this is where we have like a cocktail of goodies so um I hope always okay we'll start with the bare things first so um sometimes I try to do this at night and I have a hard time remembering all the time but when you do it's really good for your skin so this is the skin suitable ce4 rule ik and this is good because it prevents aging lines damaging UV rays it stimulates the collagen production and it diminishes like um damage from the Sun so this stuff is great at night it smells just like hot dogs I don't like hot dogs now but is the kid I used to love those hotdogs with the cheese inside and it smells just like those hot dogs with the cheese inside you put on your Facebook I kind of want a hot dog even though hot dogs grossed me out so this is the skin suitable thing so I put this on first after I wash and then at night it depends sometimes I do this sometimes I don't this is the powerhouse one that I have that I always forget to use these two but this is a skin suit occult rose very tall bTW the antioxidant night concentrate what does this do this purpose think it basically does the same thing it's got vitamin E it's got patent and the oxidant cocktail neutralizing free radicals it just makes your skin look good it reduces the effect of collagen breakdown it makes you look young and your skin look perfect that's what these two do so you put the hot dog smelling one on first vitamin C then the Verret raw b e you only use this at night only night time for these guys and then my old go to that i use all the time and i will still put this on over that mixture is the alba unpatrolled i have used this for years it won't have your pores non-comedogenic it is paraffin free mineral or food fragrance free of free of petrol products this is great so i just dab this all around my eyes and i have done this for years I'm telling you like more than 10 years I love this stuff is amazing um then for just daily moisturizer so that was nighttime so then daily I have been loving this and already have gone through a tube of this it's the Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion I got this as a sample when I bought my Clinique foundation I love and I was like oh this is amazing I've been we're using this every day as my daily moisturizer so I put this on and then I put this on my neck this is the tarte maracuja I think that's how you say that neck treatment I put this on on my neck this is from Tarte I love them I put this out there and then also I love this this come to solve a table this is the nourished organic replenishing argan oil balm I got this at Whole Foods and I love this stuff because most nights when I forget to use these pocus skies or even I use this on top I put this balm everywhere around my eyes around my face all my net everywhere and it's all organic and natural and it just makes your skin feel go and it smells smells just yummy like you're at this wonderful spa I get this a whole food and then you cannot forget your lips also so I love these this is the treat they're all organic this is one of my old favorites the soft candy criticises chapstick i love them i don't like for next to my bed and live-in joking i have literally four next to my bed one in my car one of my purse i have these everywhere then this is a new flavor as i love it is confetti cake look at this confetti cake just like the funfetti cake umm and it's it's so good it is I just want to smell it and then at night I will tell you what I do also if I don't have on my I under Ivana stuff or if I'm traveling or whatever in that night before I go to bed I still do this put some on lips then I rub it around the outer edges of my eyes to really moisturize the eye area while you're sleeping because you don't want wrinkles and I remember in duty school day my teacher taught me this that I know some chapstick in my mouth that if you take a piece of bread out and you leave it overnight it's good and dry out and be like a crouton in the morning that's like your skin but then if you take a piece of bread and you put butter on top it's going to hold that moisture in so it's not going to be like a crouton in the morning because you sealed it with those oils this is the same thing like your skin you don't want to wake up like a crouton you want to wake up like the buttered piece of bread looking moist and still delicious so that is my skincare routine I hope this helped you guys out and if you guys have any other questions about my skincare things please compost them all and I will try to ask them their answer them in the comments for you guys but basically all you remember that skincare is very important it is the number one thing to make sure that your skin stays beautiful looking and clear and all those kind of things you need something ready to clean always remember that and then you need to seal off the areas where you don't want to have any wrinkles you also going to make sure that you moisturize your neck because if you say Auto have any neck wrinkles out how many eye wrinkles yet and you wait till you are wrinkly and you do have all kinds of net wrinkles you're just going to be moisturizing the wrinkles at that point you need to do it before to delay the wrinkles from stirring just like when you wake up and you want you didn't put chapstick on and your skin is all dry and crackly it's because you need to moisturize that especially if you live in a dry area you need a lot of moisture and where you're not even drinking enough of water you're not going to hydrate everything first you got drink water that's going to clean and clear skin then I'm jumping all over the place I thought heard something we're in the other room sorry about that so first you got to drink water make sure moisturize you got to add the moisture on top to seal that in because you won't be dry and crackly and then you got to clean it with some wool scrubby and that's the basic roses Oh candies will skin care okay I hope you guys like that I'm sending you huge hugs for me and my no makeup face from my house to yours um and make sure you follow me on snapchat

hi guys it's candy and today we are trying out trends we are going to be testing out the holographic tear ducts highlighter trend which I'm going to show you how to do then a little crazy and I would holographic over I did I look I did a lip look everything so I'm going to show you guys how to do that as well so let it start it started so let's get started subscribe if you haven't follow me all over the place and here we don't so as you can see I bought a foundation on and I did my eyebrows but that's why this looks weird I look very Cara Delevingne right now but we're going to start this look by doing a quick I love skin we're going to get to the holographic tears but I thought hey why has you a holographic eyelid look as well so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take this Marc Jacobs glow stick and it looks like deodorant but with like a lot of highlighter so I'm just going to press this down onto the lid then I want to different highlight up near the brow bone so I'm taking the very edge of this revlon insta-fix highlighting stick and I'm literally just drawing it right underneath my brows and then I kind of flatten it down and blend it down onto the brow bone oops there are some eyebrow hairs that I need to tease this is highlighted them don't look at those now I'm going to take the Alchemist holographic palette from Kat Von D and a very flat brush and I'm going to take this ultra violet amethyst color with a little bit of the pink opal and I'm going to press this on to the inner corner and spread it out like so now that is Marc Jacobs frivolous pout which I kind of love the finish here and I'm going to take this bright purpley color right here and I'm going to press him on the outer corner oh look at this purple oh my goodness I'm in love with this purple and I'm going to blend it more later but we're just laying down our eyeshadow just came into the crease if you don't have a crease just make this arch shape there on your eyeballs now I'm going to take this shimmery purple color next door to him and I'm just going to go home while he's darker than he looks in the POW log I'm going to take a little bit of this purple then we get this with a light guy and then we're going to use it as our blending guy for our middle color right here I do a lot of my eye shadow mixing where I just make mixtures of colors I don't I rarely just use one coloring where I like tippity tapping around my palate now I'm going to get this lightest color and I'm going to put blend him even more next so now I'm going to get a little bit of a fluffy brush and I'm going to get a little bit of this purpley color and I'm going to blend right up above on the edges so we're just going to blend him like so when it's out enough towards the just upward out edge of your eyebrows and then I'm going to go back to the Marc Jacobs palette and get this pinky color any little pinky fleshy sparkly color will work and just kind of blend him right there so we're getting our lighter lightest up near at the brow I'm going to take this right electric purple color and I'm going to put this underneath the eye as well I'm also going to get this purple liner from Marc Jacobs in Grapevine and put this at the waterline there's stuff on here I'm just going to close it out just go above the crease area and just gently drag it up now I'm taking this glitter palette from Tuesday's so I'm going to take this confetti color and I'm going to mix it with a little bit of this fairy dust and I'm just going to press it down right there on the inner corner and then blend it right out there oh yay yay yay it gives you like glitter without being glittery and I kind of just love it now I'm going to take this K off liner from Urban Decay and I'm going to put some bright electric blue eyeliner on so now we're going to do the lips I'm using heroine lip liner from Mac I'm also going to be using this metallic lip color from Mac in the cold front so look at this color and for a little bit of lip highlight I'm just taking this ultra violet color we're going to take a little bit of the pinky to know this color is not anything more it's real result and then you know here then to finish all our eyes we are going to curl our lashes because it looks weird if you don't put your mascara on and then I'm going to use the Revlon mega multiplier mascara which I have literally been obsessed with for like the last month so here is the magical holographic cure deafness once you have your eye and your whole look complete you need a base to make sure you get this really glowy I'm just using the Smashbox photo-finish lid primer and white you could use a white eyeliner also so you just want them make sure you dab it in this area and then I take my pinky and I'm just going to kind of Pat and spread it out and I'm going to take our holographic color so I'm using the Kat Von D The Alchemist palette and all of these holographic colors but the two that I want to use the most are going to be this ultra violet amethyst and this pink opal so I'm going to take a dome-shaped smudgy brush and first I'm going to take the purple pigment and I'm going to press that right in there around the tear and you can see look at the open lessons already so we're just going to dab it and then dab it in towards the nose and up into this Cree and I'm going to speak just a smidge and go right underneath the lower part of the tear duct then to make it extra holographic I'm going to take this pink opal and I'm going to touch him right on top and he's going to just add another brighter layer of dimension now I'm going to take a flat brush and again the opal color and I'm just going to kind of blend him up and around like so you can take a little bit of these leaf sapphires like greenish color and I'm going to blend him down below so we get all different kind of color variations and we're also gonna add a little more this ring we're just going for all the colors you're getting place faceted colors everywhere it just opens up the eye and Ruby finishes any extra eye look so now we all right here on I'm going to go ahead and put some lashes on because I just feel like lashes finish off every fabulous look and we've got my favorite the flutter lashes in Kaelyn okay so this is our holographic cleared up you guys I am loving it like it's like mesmerizing my own self I also added more of the holographic powder just down tomorrow one's going to be for all the colors that ma I just put on my lip and I am like in love with the way that this let's come out lip come out look came out that's what I meant to say I didn't want to put this on face I'm gonna put a flip this blue and put this blue or I'll put on the nose I'm put down here I'm everywhere one design here ooh la la good I know I'm really a killer whale so this is our final look at what do you think do you love it do you want to do it if you guys do this tag me so that I can see this look everywhere these holographic here like things these made these may make a debut and everybody you can use any holographic eyeshadow powder I do so this one plans on your lips as a highlighter everywhere else I really

hi I'm Candi and welcome to my bedroom today I'm going to show you how to de-stress this sure if you guys been watching for a long time you know back in the day I used to do all kinds of t-shirt cutting videos and I have more for you guys coming up so make sure you like this video if you want to see more like clothing distressing videos comment share with all these friends would like this to Pullman snapchat Twitter Instagram Facebook all complaisant so you can see all kind of other things I'm doing all the time but let's get showing you how to do this to your shirt so first all you need is any shirt I got this shirt um at a flea market I'm actually gonna have to change out in some first question to the next thing you need then you're going to need a couple little knives or maybe just one and a pair of scissors so the first area we're going to work on here is the tops you want to lay your shirt flat on a table and then if this is for girls you definitely wanna be mindful of where your bra is going to be you don't want to cut any holes across with your bra strap that your bra we're going to show I mean you could you can take your scissors or your knife I will show you both options so the first thing is we want to do some collar distressing so and it's along this lines there and just give it a little pull to kind of stretch it out a little and make as many cuts of these as you want I just did one on both side of the collar and you want to sure you just leave one little patch of the fabric connected so you don't have a slip all the way across then just to make some our little de-stress holes just take your knife poke them in and give them a little twist or you could just use the end of your scissors also and please be careful do not cut or poke yourself guys I love you very much and don't want you hurt then to make these little slips with your totally optional just make a little slit with your knife saw back and forth or do this with your scissors then I'm going to show you guys two ways to do this shoulders differently so one you can cut the shoulder inside and then this will hang off more so this one we're going to go ahead and do from here then you want to fold him long ways like this so you get a good up-and-down cut like that and then you're just going to give him a little cut down like that and then you can stretch him or pull them apart and we're also going to distress the sleeves a little bit what you can do is as it's folded step right here you just want to make sure that you pull it so you stretch it out so it doesn't look so like perfectly cut and you can do as many of these or as little as you want it's really you can't mess about that this is your own creation and then I like to do the ones where this is hanging at the bottom so for that you want to just get right near the seam and we're just going to cut him and it cut them a little longer and you kind of pull and then on this side I'm going to give you a different variation until you've just cutting on the other side of the scene for this week you're going to make sure you flaps make some cuts straight down like this give them a tug you can do holes all along here but the next thing I'm going to show you is down at the bottom which makes it really fun so you're just going to make sure that your shirt is folded evenly and smoothly and the Vodnik match up then you can take your scissors and just snip along the inside of the scene just like you did on the seat give this guy a pull thing you can even do some more holes over here so he looks kissed dressed then we're going to do the other side so he doesn't feel left out make sure you fold it over smooth give him a little snip Errol and if you want you can just like tear it apart so it looks a little rougher stretch him out check this guy out and then it was like he may need purple goes here so put some more holes washes whatever you want be distressed your shirt up a little bit and after you wash it it gets even better looking - well this part if you have whether you're on a chamois are involved and people look at that almost it was covering up many knots in it then you know and you're wrapping burying a mirror and you can see where you'd like being stressed so here I want this collar up more so I'm just going to tear em apart make that a bigger hole you can pull these he could be bigger so I'm just going to tear him more like that that eases off here on my own he so fun not to recover easily home into a new commandment care I'm going to work I want to bridge here do not cut yourself and you have a carrot don't mind the juice on the rocks trap that's better already we're going to aren't any show that I'm going to just make in a little should good awesome yes there you go you're looking better already buddy there we go we're getting better already then you go down here and you can just give these days of stretch out you can cut another strip down here and lump it we can help something that so that was it guys here is my final shirt you can cut your dust as much as little anything as you want let me know if you guys want to see more of these comment below and if you guys do to your shirt has we Twitter me anything at hashtag can be I like it it's an DIY so I can see your creations that you made to it's super fun to have customized you don't have to do all the flashes and passion winging flashes hang like I did but you can do as many as you want and then as many of these down below as you want also but let me see your creations to let me know if you guys want to see more of these for me attempted to attempt a so almost play just to see more things or different ways I'm wearing different shirts and clothes and stuff like that also and it's always huge hug from my house to yours have so much fun getting dressed don't care whether people think don't change your style or anything to take me what are you afraid they're going to make fun of you were telling anything they don't have to wear it and I let your creativity shine this is so much more creative than a regular t-shirt so have fun creating your own shirt scoop to creation and if anybody said anything to you just say hey just glad you don't have to wear them so I like it so that's what I have to tell you that oh and I will put links to do you guys want down below to my old t-shirt cutting videos if you want to check those out too and other than that I will see you guys in the next video

brushes I have work as well as her brush the number 12 one love this so honest off so you did bro I I wear it in dark brown that's the color I have because as you can see my roots that I've really welcomed back into town they are dark hair just like my natural dark here is also another favorite too also made a comeback is the soar lip liner which I got flow out everywhere because then Kylie Jenner start wearing it and then no one could buy at any other Mac stores but I'm going to show you guys a little do Peru for this so up top we're putting the soar and down below we're putting this is the jordana rock and rose which you can get at any drugstore let me give a little zoom in zoom zoom this is rock and Rose this is soar I actually like this store is a little rock and Rose is a little cooler so I have been wearing the rock and rose instead of store and I love it I actually have on if anybody's wondering today where did it go it's a color pop one and I just had it and it just did I take it somewhere I don't know where it went I've got praline no I don't I got tea rose from ELF this is another drugstore one I have this on my lips and then I also put this is from NYX the matte this a shot I think we just called shy put a little this on top and the lip liner when I find it I will tell you guys it is the color oh here it is color pop in bound these color pop guys are cool cuz you get one side as your thick side and then you get one sided as your lip liner this is brilliant I love this from colour-pop that is so cool and also another favorite okay another favorite item of mine this is the cut very original drinking chocolate this is made in the United Kingdom you can't get this in the u.s. normally I get it at world market and you should get it because this blows all hot chocolates and stuff Abelard this is so delicious another favorite is also Hulu I don't know if you guys are obsessed with any TV shows maybe American Idol or stuff like that new girl or whatever you can watch all those on whoo I love it I love you don't have to wait for TV anymore like you had to wait before all not one day a week whatever I just love what technology is doing so you can watch your Hulu and then maybe drink your hot drinking chocolate another random favorite I'm just throwing in here too so I was like moving and packing and I already talked about that why moving and stuff I found all my old wallets which are all in these lovely shade of turquoise pale minty blue which I totally love if anybody wants to know this is Ted Baker wallet time ago I don't even know if they make him but this color I just want to like ride it and jump inside this color and then this this glittery one I love this also this is from Dulux I don't even know if they make this color anymore either cuz these are both I've had for like a couple years just want to show you my colorful wallets in case anybody wanted to know they also match the jeffree star Breakfast at Tiffany's lip color if you're lucky I'm gonna put this on ho at the end of the video things got a little crazy right there were 40 lip colors if you do not know about these these are the Kat Von D um crush ice shadows and I have raw power on today I have it underneath and up in this crease love this color did I put some of this one this is called synergy and I don't know no I didn't put them on but this color is beautiful too but this color let me just give you a sample on my hand and just show you the deliciousness of this color like just look at the beauty of that color this will look great with blue eyes green eyes brown eyes I just love this so much he's go yes I love him um also two-faced I don't know if you own any toothpaste products but the scent of the chocolate in the Too Faced I just I just want to rub this on my nose I know that would be weird contouring but like I literally just want to rub this so I can smell it this is like like somehow bad chocolate smells like you that doesn't really smell like chocolate this is not only a great matte product cuz there's no shimmer because I don't like contour bronze colors with shimmer um but this smell it's like marshmallow a vanilla chocolate and I just want to breathe I just put them I did I did already care of them by my nose I totally love this and it smells so so good I love it this also comes with a sad story because then we're going to go downstairs and I'll show you my storage things but so I was going to show you guys my lipstick storage thing as I was carrying upstairs I don't all the lipsticks out except for these guys and this lip liner and this color I dumped a model out there all on the floor right here this is so sad so you set this on your counter and he swivels so you can do all the sides oh my gosh no more I'm making arraign lipsticks so this is from lux box and I love this the only thing that would make this better is oh my gosh I'm on the break stuff is this Mac would make it so that you could have the color of the lipstick on the bottom or see-through lids so you knew what color was what nothing drives me crazy er than opening a million of these lids to find the color that I'm looking for it drives me bananas Bob Nana's let me just show you so Mac came out with a line and they did these Giambattista Valli colors and then the outside color is the color of the inside lipstick brilliant Mac can we

nawaki thumbs up you can like it and subscribe that's it that meant so get ready as you're going to see me without any makeup on okay so the first thing we're gonna do is put some music on and hopefully we won't get sick of hearing this song for however long it takes me to do my makeup for me when I put it on make one it could take maybe like 30 minutes or so man it gets kind of boring in silence so we're gonna find some royalty-free music to listen to for however long this takes this is for an hour so hopefully it won't take that long and it will have music this is gonna be too loud will turn down low okay so the first thing I'm gonna do is take my Beauty Blender I'm gonna just do nothing with it because okay song you're being annoying okay guys are you ready so the first thing we're going to do is I want to put some music on because it gets very boring just putting your makeup on in silence and this could take 20-30 minutes I don't know so we're going to start with our music hopefully this won't get annoying and then I'm going to take um my view blender I'm gonna take this Marc Jacobs the coconut primer I love those stuff and I'm gonna put it all over my face it gives you like the most flawless perfect finished unlike any other primer I've ever used I just love it so we're putting this all over here and then my hair is like super faded it's looking more orange than red so don't look at my hair huh okay so now how are you're all primed and ready to go now I'm going to take Beautyblender and then this is the colony colony this is the clinic beyond perfecting foundation which I love this stuff if you like full coverage you will lose your mind over this stuff and it comes with this little guy like this so I just like I just paint designs it's just fun to do that on my face everywhere I put it over on my forehead all over get out of here put it on my eyelids everywhere that you want good coverage and then I also go like along my jawline and then under there because you want to blend everywhere let's blend this first will you Tim out of the way and then all around the chin and all over the face and then you just start looking like perfect dog skin which I this just covers up everything I love it I don't know if you guys can hear this music I hope you can it's not just like for my amusement oh oh what am I doing here in these bangs they're looking crazy so I didn't go like onto my ear a little bit just blend everywhere because that's like where people will look and be like oh my gosh you did not blend your makeup and we just Pat this all around you can get more if you need whoa if you need more coverage now's lazy I don't even let my Beauty Blender if you guys don't know you're supposed to use them white but sometimes I'm just lazy and I don't wet it and I just put it on like this and my thing I love the right looks go Roy I'm gonna put a little more neck is so wait until go on the Sun or something geez Louise okay now look at this coverage boom okay if you want a little more extra coverage I'm gonna get this is the cover effects cream concealer over my stocks okay this is great for like under the eye area and I just use like a little smidge II like I just put a little on the tip of my Beauty Blender like this and then I'll just go underneath the eyes if you have like any rings or anything like if I don't sleep very much like I went to New York last week and I literally flew there and I slept one hour in five minutes because I had to take a red-eye and then get up and speak at a panel this made me look like I slept and then I always put it on the eyelids because you just have to because the eyelids are purple and veiny and then whatever eyeshadow you put on if you don't do this is going to look purpley and meny and not very good neither while around your nose remember I think that's the only place I want to put it on a little look there haha okay we're done with this but his cap on and then I'm gonna put my powder my favorite powder is this lemare powder and it's kind of expensive it's like I don't know I don't know how much it is like 60 or 80 bucks or something but it lasts you like this lasts me like two years and it just makes you look like a baby so you could use any translucent powder you don't have to use the one I'm using so I just sent my face with this if you don't set it with powder all your makeups gonna smear and melt off and then that's annoying and then I put this on the brows that way your eyebrows go on perfect and smoothly you soak up some of the oil from the foundation put it on mouth now trick I've been doing Oh No where did I put it whoo but that was powdery everywhere okay I don't know where I put it so you can take your hi-def powder this is from graft oh you could use it from anybody I was going to use my makeup for everyone but I just take this and I put this underneath the eyes because this makes it so any of the eyeshadow you put on it just like fluffs off if you get it under there so I do that oh but no no no I don't care poifect okay so now that I've done that's a forever now we're going to do eyeballs and I better have my eyeshadow brush in here okay this is not my eyeshadow brush okay now we're going to go to this pout this is my Ben Nye palette which I love I love this path with the glam palette so you can use any color I'm just taking like a nude ivory color put this in the inner corner of both of our eyes then I take the more peachy er1 and then I blend it out to the outer edge we'll take this light guide and we'll even put him up here then this more peachy one and we marry them together like so um where's my smaller guy then I'll take like a dome shape brush or any kind of one really and I take like this great Opie color maybe a little brown a little more gray topi and then we're going to go in the crease whoa that was way too in the crease so we just kind of smudge him like that whoa that was a little more than what we wanted actually that was a lot more where's my fluffy there I'm going to take a little bit of the peach if you ever make a mistake just take a lighter eyeshadow color just like fluff it back on top like that oh shoot I forgot to do contouring Oh Brava okay so this is my matchmaster concealer stick and number eight for Mac and you're supposed to do this before you said with powder but we're just gonna add it on and I just draw the temples a little do a little cheek contour hope you knew little nose contour why not like this under there I can't believe I did that oh my gosh then I almost put the cap on oh brother so we'll just blend this in this is not supposed to just before you power it oh well life isn't perfect and neither is Jamaica so just blend this like so there we go haha it's still working just not how it blends much better when you um do it before you put the powder on because the powder light locks at all it makes your skin like more not movie but it's working and then now we're gonna blend here how did I do that one the tip of the nose okay all right well it came out okay that's just not the way you're supposed to do it but haha there's many ways to skin a cat ah that's a horrible thing I pretend I didn't say that who came up with that but I think that the things awful thing who wants to skin a cat that is horrible I hate that thing look at it it's right here i nose of it just itch it with your sponge so you don't scratch off the tip of your makeup okay now what was i doing oh yeah let's get this little dome shaped tiny guy and then we're going to get this great Opie and peachy color again and we're gonna go right under there out this brush is a little scratchy so we're just doing a little bit in there now okay so now I am going to use our liner this is the makeup forever ink liner this is my favorite liquid liner ever so I'm gonna have to get very close to mummy rock to do this we're going to pick him up really close and then what I like to do is I like to start here and I just lay him down on the top then I just do little strokes out to the side and though we're going to guess then I fill in all the way to the lashline if you don't do that you're going to have weird gaps so then after I do that and like it's kind of dried out a little bit the product on here then I go back and start at the inner corner here and just connect the line in little strokes like that then you can decide where you want your wings so I think I want him to go how high do we want you to wing today little buddy I just make like little little dash strokes till I figure out like where I really want it then I get some more product in here and then I just hold him the skin taut and connect him all the way down and then well I made a wobble does the heart but I can't talk so and I just connect him right there then you still in and then you see how wobbly your wing is and when you're done oh shoot sometimes the wings get out of control like super wobbly stop being wobbly okay one down now let's do the same thing over here start at the middle he's a little thicker than I wanted him to be then we go into the inner corner ah ah you like my noises there okay and then we're going to try to match where we win Oh buddy he's so wobbly over here it's hard to get your wings symmetrical and if anybody says it isn't you are not being honest person okay so we want him to wing right it out okay so there's our sketchy strokes now just connect them how are you crooked you liner wings who little okay now my trip for fixing winged liner is where's my brush and my black eyeshadow where are you okay so I'm going to take black out eyeshadow which is one of em if a brief dose and a little flat brush you could use an angled brush - OH pitching on the nose and then you just take the black shadow and you go right on the edge where you just put the liquid liner and you like soften it it like buzzes and blurs it all out so it looks like you did like a perfect winged liner even if it's like a little wobbly oh I shadow you just got all over underneath my eye you're not supposed to do that oh man dust you up oh okay guys so I was gonna do this video feel like I'm not editing it there's gonna be no cuts or anything but when memory cards keep filling up so hopefully this one has lots of room on it but we still have this smudger oh I'm going to take a little more of my concealer that powder was supposed to prevent this wah just dab right on top like it'd never happen then we gotta put powder on it again I'm not using that hi-def powder I'm using my other translucent powder there we go but after normal okay so now that we have that done time to curl my lashes so we will do a look at I got to ashes in here I can curl two lashes at the same time are you ready for this have you ever seen this in a video I can't see anything now but my lashes are curled we're gonna curl the tips ha this is thought whoa this probably help do not try this at home folks unless you're a skilled makeup artiste even if you are you still may not want to try that at home okay so now it's time to do mascara I'm going to use this is this IT tight line mascara whoops I put it backwards every time and then I just you can get so close to the lash line with this little baby guy I just wiggle him super close in there I'm going to do the tops and if you put your head down them back like this it makes sure that you don't blink and get it up on the lid that is so cool I'm going to get the lower lashes with this guy because he's little ah perfect now we're going to do the top lashes with ah where's my chart mascara oh where are you tardy Oh Who I don't know where my part master it's my favorite mascara what No okay we're going to use this other one this Too Faced one where's my car when I love it whoa this guy's brush is ginormous wasn't ready for that almost okay so print up we're gonna put gonna put a few coats of mascara on and again whenever I do I I things and lip liners is like I can't talk like I'm a surgeon okay so we got building up all layers I like to do like 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 20 coats nesters sometimes but he's looking great looking pretty look look at what I got okay while he's drying let's do our eyebrows where's my eyebrow guy so I kind of been where's my eyebrow one oh did I leave him downstairs no please stay no okay I isn't loving these urban decay brow feeder ones this is a neutral ground I want a dark brown these be dark brown are you dark brown warm brown oh wait you see dark brown yes dark brown okay so I'll show you how I fill these guys in so I do little hairlike strokes so just I should probably put this more this with you as you can see so like sometimes I'll starting here on the top I just do the top line and then the bottom like that and I still in everything in between the little strokes like hair so the top and then I do the inner corner and up right here real crisp some people don't like their brows like this would I do and then we get the arch real well too so I just hold still and draw him down like that well what happened there got a wobble and then you take this other brushy side and you just like flew them brush em into shape kinda boom look at the difference now let's do this guy so we're going to do the top I don't mind that this song is it on repeat I kind of like it down here and do underneath it's crazy good like I feel like the most time-consuming part of the whole makeup is put in my foundation on with this the most important part and we're going to do it here whoo I need to tweeze these babies sometimes I won't put makeup on for like a couple days and then when I go to come on whoa my eyebrows how did I not look at you ever in boom now do a little Russia

hi guys it's candy and I'm making it view no way it's really weird like I hope this video doesn't get any views I hope nobody has to watch a video on how to handle the loss of a loved one or anything like that but if you have or you know somebody to have seen I hope that you share this with them and I just hope that it helps somebody out there watching this and I'm going to share my story what I've gone through losing my dad especially I'm making it today because today marks the five-year anniversary that my dad died and I just want to share with you guys some things that helped me and I hope it will help you also so five years ago today my dad was supposed to pick me up at the airport I get a call on the way to the airport I'm saying that my dad had died in an accident and I mean there was like this icy chilling feeling I didn't want to be on the earth anymore I didn't I couldn't believe my brain couldn't process it's still even hard for my brain to process that he's not here you know and it's been five years um so I want to give you guys some things that helped me along the way but one important thing is you need to let yourself cry you need to let yourself grieve and and go through these process otherwise it's going to eat you up internally and there's been studies that show there's a chemical composition in tears it's different for tears that are grieving versus other types of tears that you cry and my grandmother once said that tears are what water the heart so the rainbows of healing can come out over it and it really is important you let that out if you hold it up inside and you just suppress all those feelings and emotions and numb yourself with other things it's going to come out and it's going to hurt you so much worse later let yourself grieve give yourself time to take care of you and just love yourself and be gentle with yourself during that time I cried so so much I mean I got the call I was on the way to the airport and I got the call and them saying that my dad had died in an accident and it was just a spicy cold feeling just took over my heart my mind my brain couldn't believe it I just like no no no I can't believe my brain couldn't process what they were telling me that he had died like I could I didn't want to believe it I could I wasn't processing it right I wanted to like jump through the windshield of the car and just go to heaven like I didn't want to be on earth to deal with that pain I was feeling and I cried so much I mean every muscle in my face hurt my eyeballs were pounding and hurting my head was just hurting with this excruciating pain and never cried so much and like that in my life and you have to let yourself go through that to heal you also to safeguard yourself from other people you know people that may not be sensitive to what you're going through sometimes people will say the wrong thing and it's just cuz they don't know what to say you know like a lot of people say things like oh time heals everything and I will just tell anybody now let's don't try not to say that - anyway it's lost someone because that does nothing to comfort them if anything when somebody would say that I'd be like why would you say that unless you're going to give me ten years I'm going to feel not as terrible I'm like that doesn't help me in any way at all and also people say like I'll just think of the good times I was like are you kidding me the good sense was making me cry let's do it sometimes people just don't know what to say and they just say the wrong thing so just be careful who you surround yourself with during that time sometimes people - just listen my one of my best friends she just called and she describes me on the phone she didn't say one word she listened to me and she just cried with me and that was really missed so much to me and also you don't feel like regrets or things that you feel like that I know sometimes after a loved one dies you could feel angry or upset like why you just happen or angry at certain things that happen in the life or maybe a situation or a life history that you have with them and this is time where you just let that go and I know some people have said that if you write like a write a letter to them with all the things you wish you could tell them to get everything in your brain out on paper that that help I know I've heard other people say like if you pretend they're in the chair and you can just tell everything you wish you could tell them whether it's an I'm sorry or things that frustrated your things you're sad or happy or you miss all those things you can do that just fork in there in the chair and tell them and other things I know sometimes people want to maybe let put away things that ring find them of the person or get rid of things this is not something I've dealt with but I know something other people do for me I wanted to save and hold on to everything that reminded me of my dad like every single thing I wanted to save and those are things that you do want to cherish you do want them to be a part of your daily life you know there was a mug that was my dad's and I do want to drink tea out of it you know because I remember that reminded me of my dad you know and there's those kind of things that you want to celebrate also it comes time when there's holidays or my dad died just a few days before Father's Day which is really hard because like my dad died and I remember I had to go in the store to buy some water or something and I saw those people talking about I find it a Father's Day card and just hearing them say the word dad was like I was just trying not to break down and cry like I don't have a dad when a Father's Day card for an idea I mean he's okay I do good to call your dad dad I don't get to call my dad anymore you know and and I remember you have to celebrate those things so when Father's Day does roll around I want to celebrate that I had the most amazing dad I could have ever asked for you know and on his birthday I again I want to celebrate that he was alive and this is the day that he came into the world and I'm so happy he got to come into the world and be my dad and that I'm thankful I couldn't be born because he was born then - and then in holidays you want to celebrate them even more you know the first Christmas that rolled around I was like I didn't feel like it I didn't want to celebrate Christmas I just feel like I wanted to decorate I just didn't feel like I was just going to miss my dad's not being there you know and then something turned around inside my thoughts and I'll let you know what my dad would want me to make this the most festive beautiful awesome Christmas and so I decided no I was going to go all out I was going to make it so worth worthy of my dad coming in there and being like I love it this is amazing this is so beautiful like I wanted to celebrate even more and I wanted to I decided I wanted to share more of my dad's sparkle more of the things he loved more of what I loved about my dad with the world and so something that I realized after my dad died is I want to live bigger bolder and braver and better in honor of my dad and you can do that and honor the person that you lost you live bigger you live bolder you live braver in their honor do more things that you want to do go and take that extra step to go after your dream or something in their honor to make them proud don't shrimp Mac don't let your life be ruined and feel like a part of you died because that person what doesn't want you to live this miserable fat life they would want you to go out and live life to the fullest because you are here one more day on this earth breathing so you go limit as amazing as you can and make the world around as amazing as you can share parts of what made that person amazing everywhere you go so you're taking a little bit more of them everywhere you go and know that they're living on in your heart my dad is still so alive in my heart in my thoughts in my memory I listen to music that he loved whether it makes me cry or it just makes me happy thinking all the memories I have with him I will do that and I want you guys to know that that's how you're going to make their memories live on that's how you're going to let their legacy live on you know share that with your children all the great stories you have about them things that made them amazing so their spirit lives on in them and you have to do things that help you process that was for me I mean I didn't eat for days I wasn't hungry I had no habit I was just so upset and I bring every time I would wake up in the morning I just remember I would wake up for a split second and I would think oh I'm just awake and then it would hit me that my dad had died and like like three seconds after my eyes open and then that's just like depression and sadness and crime would start the whole day again and if you guys are feeling that know that that's okay and you know now when I wake up in the morning it's not the first thing that I think about anymore and don't feel guilty for laughing or having fun or I remember after I've been crying so long and hadn't been eating at all these things it's like I felt guilty that I was going to laugh or guilty that I was going to enjoy a moment when I felt like no you should be sad forever you should never be happy again you know and I listed how my dad would want me to live like he would want me he would want to hear my laughs he wouldn't want me to be happy and enjoy things so I'm reading crying for days and days and days you know and I would listen to comedy things i watch comedy videos on youtube i watch some Dane Cook videos i watch different stand-up comedy things so emotionally you just need a break from the crying you know and so I would watch these Dane Cook videos and I would laugh you know I just needed a break from all the crime that I've been doing and that really didn't help laughter really is healing and therapeutic and you just need a break from that constant emotional grief and heaviness that you're experiencing and you do need to enjoy things enjoy things in their honor you know and you have to live your life again it's fine beautiful moments enjoy beautiful days sometimes in those beautiful moments where you're out doing things I would see the sun shining I would be like it feels like my dad is smiling down at me from heaven and those are the moments that you rejoice in you know I rejoice knowing you know my dad's DNA is in my very vein and the loved one that you're missing if it's a family member their DNA is in your very days that you know you are there to carry their spirit around you have elements of them everywhere you go and you need to shine that with the world around you share things that you loved about them with the world you know you can live that peace if they loved decorating things and you can love decorating if they love being daring thing you can be a little bit more daring just enjoy life and the bigger the better the bolder in their honor celebrate them every way that you can and know that you know time does heal things where you know I'm not waking up every morning in the shock of realizing that my dad is no longer here like I wake up and it's not the first thought I'm thinking like oh my dad is not alive anymore that's not my first thought anymore in the mornings but I do miss him everyday I think about him every day it lessens the sting time lessons that initial the shock of them being gone and you getting used to them you know that is lesson but no part of it I don't miss him any less I still miss him I still want to call him I still you know when good things happen he I want to tell him about and when staffing dry still overwhelmed I want to call him you know and then I think about what would my dad tell me what would he do in this instance and whatever the person you lost you live on a legacy for them you carry on those things that they loved and celebrate them you know on the day that they died or on their birthday or holidays celebrate them you know just give yourself a time to heal enjoy things don't pretend that you're happy and that you're okay feel the feelings that you need to if that's healthy it's going to eat you up inside it's going to do damage to other parts in your life if you don't processes and let that go and know that you're not alone know that I'm feeling this with you if people in the comments below want to share you know their stories or just letting everybody know that you're not alone in this you just know that I'm sending you so much love and hugs from my heart I just pray that heavenly comfort wraps you up like a cozy blanket and makes you feel loved and and just feels peace my greatest hope is that I will see my dad in heaven and though he wasn't ever able to get to the airport to pick me up I know he will be at the arrival section in heaven to welcome me there and that is my greatest my greatest joy and my greatest comfort and number one time I was running you know just a few days after my dad died maybe a week or two and I would just be crying and I looked down I saw a spark plug in the dirt and I picked it up and I held it in my hand it was almost if I could feel like my dad telling me like I will always be the spark plug in your heart and I just I just looked up at the Sun and I just thought thank you God for letting me find this and letting this be a little bit of something that makes me feel like I just love my dad so much and I remember driving home with a car full my dad belongs after I packed them up and and just crying and I'm on the radio this song came on I never heard before and it was by building 429 and it was called this is not where I belong and the word said something along the lines of this is not where I belong I'm not home yet and my home is in heaven before we belong enough to my dad was and that's just song just like spoke so much healing to my heart and somebody also said right after my dad died I took a little break from YouTube for a while and somebody wrote to me somewhere and they said you know God pick some flowers for heaven when they're at their most beautiful in bloom on earth and somehow when they said that to me that was so comforting to me into my heart and I I know that my dad was he was just I didn't understand why he was so healthy he was in such good shape and I just thought that my dad would always live forever you know and it just puts things in perspective just

price on that too because I just didn't have enough cash I got these overalls are from um I think the 50s he said I'm gonna have to show you guys look at how cool these overalls are look at the back is super cool these are awesome and they have like cool patches on the back I love those I got this like pink silk robe that I thought would be super cool to wear with like a t-shirt and some boyfriend jeans or if I just need to robe to get ready while I'm doing videos it's like a cool vintage robe oh my gosh I got if you guys know I already have a rolling stone shirt that I wear all the time that I cut the sleeves off but I got him because I can like distress me though he smells horrible wait till you see my tips on how to make things smell better because he definitely needs that and then I got this kind of looks like a bowling shirt and then I just got it because it says West Covina and that's where like that's where my parents are from that's where they met um I grew up there when I was a little child so if you're from West Covina and this nose ring is totally fake just like a fun accessory like anything else you wear um but I know you guys asked where I got these like little knuckly ring things these I also got at the Melrose trading post at the Vita cush um booth look what I got for $10 these glasses you can do like in my life and everything in there I will never lose these if you buy $10 glasses you never lose them if you got expensive one you'll lose in the first time you wear them then it's a wasteland which is like a vintage II store and I got this cool it says it's a sample I'm sure this is just super Polly doesn't smell weird he's just like pretty and I got him then I got this hat wait till you see this hat look at the size of this hat is this amazing or what I'll just show you the tips on how to clean this lip it's just like a gigantic ginormous hat I love it so when you shop at the thrift stores or flea markets or anything you get things like really cool one-of-a-kind things that really help create your style and make you stand out that way you don't look like everybody else that we bought all their stuff at forever 21 owners are or wherever you shop where everything looks the same you can have a really unique print on your own clothes because you have like one-of-a-kind pieces and just look for things that you're I like

shopping and you get things like really feels like it's way less than if you go to the store anyway so that Omaha now on to my five tip for vintage flea market thirst or shopping and making your things smell amazing I'm gonna give you guys my five tips for vintage thirst or or flea market hunting number one is if you buy jewelry these earrings are one of my favorites I've had these for years and I got these at the Melrose trading post you can disinfect them in rubbing alcohol or you can just buy these little hooks at like a craft store and just put a whole entire new hook which is what I like to do the best also it's good to get new backs especially if they're post because the backs will be a little loose to tip too if you buy a hat like this hat which I got and I totally love you can take a disinfecting wipe wipe the inside spray disinfecting spray and the Sun also kills all kinds of funky bacteria and smells you can leave it out in the Sun for a few hours tip number three places to hunt for treasures if you live near an area where you know like wealthier people live like I would go to the thrift store in Beverly Hills because wealthy people are going to get rid of designer things and I have found many designer things in a thrift store things that were probably hundreds of dollars and I got for like $3 so go to the wealthy areas to look for some designer things for a few dollars tip number four shoes sometimes you just see a pair of vintage shoes II you gotta have like these boots that I got on eBay that are a little too small but I keep them because I think maybe my feet are gonna shrink these are so cool I think I'd appear like this when I was like seven or eight and I was just like I love them I feel like I love them just like when I was seven but if you buy a pair of these boots or any shoe if you get a high heel what you want to do is also take those disinfecting wipes wipe the bottom really well we're getting disinfecting spray to spray inside that's what they do at bowling alleys to kill all the germs in there and then I definitely get like a gel insole liner that way you're stepping on brand-new bottoms for your feet so it's kind of like a new shoe and you disinfected it and it's pretty darn these are 20 like 20 25 bucks on eBay tip number five is going to be how do you make your clothes smell amazing I don't know why but people always ask me like what laundry detergent and software do I use cuz I guess when I give hugs and stuff my clothes smell good so I'm going to share with you guys my personal laundry blend that we've got to go on a little field trip to my washroom so are you ready to go get your parents permission on a slip and we're going to take a field trip to my laundry room so welcome to my laundry room if you guys didn't know I move and I got a new washer and dryer the guy at Home Depot gave me really bad instructions on washing with this so I partnered with time they taught me what I was doing wrong and they even send me free soap so I'm going to teach you guys what they taught me if you have a high-efficiency one it uses less water so you can't use the regular amount of soap because that makes too much bubbles and they're not going to smell clean so this you just use the pods and like if you're using a regular size you use one pod or if I'm watching like a larger load I put in two pots and that's how it comes out smelling good there bubbles like collapse quicker with the little amount of water so it's better for the environment it saves time saves water all those things and your clothes smell better because it's not making all this foamy stuff and it just gets out the stains the stink everything from my clothes so that's what I use I use two of these pretty much all the time unless I barely throwing anything in there and then I use this in spring meadow so this is number one and then I also put in the downy UNSTOPABLES in spring also because this smells amazing and sometimes I even mix it up I also have the downy UNSTOPABLES in dazzle so sometimes I'll put a little dazzle and a little fringe like I'm making a special mixture of sense and then this is kind of new this is the unstoppable premium scent booster with fabric conditioner and lush this smells so good so what I do I fill up the little cap of this lush guide this smells so good I would like wear this as a perfume and then I fill the cap up with ease and I'd like to do it sometimes before the filter ring because it just makes the fun sound are you ready ahh sound so fun to me I'm just gonna put in the one pod otherwise I would put in two and then I'm just gonna wash these two rides together these two guys moisten them for colors and then start and therefore this note or anything so that was it guys make sure you stay tuned because I am going to have more t-shirt cutting videos some just dressing shirt videos and one how to make a t-shirt into a really cute dress thing so make sure you subscribe you get notified whenever I upload a video you can follow me all over the internet candy Johnson kan de Johnson that's what my parents named me all over Twitter Facebook snapchat Pinterest everywhere you go you'll find me at that name and remember wear whatever style that you love don't feel like you have to change who you are or be like anybody else you stand out and shine you'll be a pink treat in a forest of green wear what you like and don't let anybody stop you or make you feel like you can't shine and be who you are and if somebody does make fun of you you can listen to my grandmother's advice that always told me if somebody makes fun of what you're wearing just tell them just be glad you don't have to wear it and you wear what you love whatever makes you happy these earrings make me happy that's what my style is whatever makes you happy that is what your style is also and go out into the world and shine it and no I would cheer you on and celebrate people's differences in their styles not everybody has to look the same I love enjoying and appreciating other people's styles that are different and unique the world would be so boring if we all looked alike so small-minded people are gonna be like and you don't look like me you don't dress like me creative open-minded people that are loving love creativity and love differences they're gonna love everybody being unique and awesome and representing their style in their own way and know that abuse a I love whatever you're wearing because of you and you are awesome I love you guys huge hugs from my house to yours I

this is amazing I love it excuse me My Love Bug that's not one of my favorite term the month I like that way this on me then um okay this is like a tech gadget that is a stinking amazing and my friend invented it and I think it's so cool I would put a link below for this light is for your phone if you do videos you're taking a selfie anything so she used to work with the celebrity that was very particular about lighting and they used this same kind of technology for the lighting so let me just show you an example so you have this clip you clip it on right you clip it on either face board if you're doing like a selfie or something then you turn these guys on let me turn them on there's these two little dials in the back and then there's like the different levels of brightness I don't know if you can see it on the camera but you could make it really bright or not as right and then you can aim this down any direction wherever you're at or taking your selfie even at night it gives you like the most beautiful lighting you can clip it on your laptop you can slip it on here and it's not even really that expensive either it's like 37 bucks or something I'll put a link below this is so cool I just keep this in my computer bag and then there's these dials where you can change how bright you want it you can do super bright not as bright and then you just turn it off and then you just charge it put in the USB thing I love this this is the coolest thing ever then my other favorite okay this a bunch of people have been asking me about my foundation lately this makes my skin look so stinking perfect it is amazing it's the Clinique beyond perfecting foundation and concealer in one and you just you just put it on this coverage if you like full coverage and you want to look like your skin is perfect you will fall in love with this I don't know if people think about old clinic that's like a grandma kinda brand but I saw this and I saw like the pictures of how it made people's skin look and I was like I need that I need that and this is my favorite foundation I just love it so so so I don't know why we're wagging around cuz I love it and I love it okay my other favorite thing this isn't my favorite I've been doing like a lot is a winged liner and this is the ink liner from makeup forever which I love this it's totally mad it doesn't crackle or separate or come off I I just love it in a super inky dark dark Wacken it's got little beads to shake it up okay we'll do another hair favorite thing this pillow proof kenn doc blow dry to day extender it's like a dry shampoo I got this at my I'm hair salon because my hair girl put it on my hair and I was like what is that delicious smell and it was this stuff it smells so good so even when your hair is clean I will spray this in at the roots and it just gives you like volume and lift and texture that is perfect and it smells smells like perfume I love it um another favorite thing what else do I have here is that all my favorites oh I'll show you because a bunch of people asked so this is my hat I love that hat so I've been wearing this hat in a lot of just a lot of days of my life and it is from Brixton it is it's just like that bricks in supply company I don't know the model looks like the matrix does something with the am M&amp;A so that my hat if you like that hat - if you don't like that hat don't go get it okay there's two more things than I'm fully done okay so this is from Urban Decay it's their naked lip liner this is an old favorite of mine it's back again because I love this color I've been wearing it likes a lot when I do like nude lip colors and then last but not least he I had to bring them back for an encore favor because I love this stuff so so so so so so so so so much so this is from nourish organic it's the argan oil balm and it just kind of looks like a deodorant stick or something but I rub it all over my face this is the only face moisturizer I've been using for like the last couple months and my skin looks amazing I was having like some weird redness around like my nose and stuff told it went away I love this stuff I bought it at Whole Foods so you could try and find it at your local Whole Foods also and I think that is all for my favorites and so that is all of my favorites comment below if you like me doing my favorites without makeup on because haha that's just more fun that I want you guys to know like life isn't about all looking perfect all the time like your makeup has to be perfect and impeccable like the truth is most days I don't even wear makeup at all unless I'm going somewhere and I have to put it on but I want you guys to know like that is the truth and this is like my real face so there's nothing on it and like I totally think that's okay like I don't want people thinking like oh there's a solution if everybody looks perfect and their makeup looks perfect and everything all the time because that's not real and that's not life and a lot of times I just don't have time to put makeup on and I got to start doing stuff and this is the face that the world's gonna see what do you think I look like a boy or what or ugly or whatever I don't care this is the face I'm born with and my personality and my heart loving people is what I want to shine more than my makeup anyway so I hope that you guys feel that and know that you don't have to feel perfect and all those kind of things just know that I love you guys so much I think you're awesome oh and I have an idea so I was thinking I want to do like a make a video like

hey guys it's candy and I want to start doing motivational Monday's again so whatever days a week you're watching this that's totally fine but I'm gonna try to upload these on Monday for you guys and comment below or other video topics you would like to see for this below and subscribe if you haven't you've over snapchat Twitter Instagram for life inspirational stuff during the rest of the week too but on Twitter what do you guys asked for a video about how to deal with negative friends this is a huge one because definitely your friends can take your life to really great places and inspire you or they can take you to really negative places and you're not who doing much good with your life and it all can be from having just negative friends around you and how to deal with just negative friends and the whole so I'm going to get into telling guys they say that you become like the five people that you surround yourself with hanging out with the most so this can be scary because if you take a little survey of the five people that you surround yourself with the most are they negative are they inspiring are they doing something good with their life are they making you be a better person are they just bringing fun or joy or love or something to your life if not if your friends are bringing you down being negative making you feel awful maybe not doing things that are inspiring maybe they're doing nothing with their life maybe they're just doing bad things with their life and there's a certain part where you can be around people and be like oh well you know sometimes not all people are perfect not all friends are perfect you know well that is true to an extent but sometimes after a while if those people are still continuing down bad paths or just being negative all the time they're not going to necessarily be helping you go to good places in your life not saying you're better than anyway this is not what this is about at all just saying that I have had friends that are very negative and it started to affect me and my emotions and I started realizing like oh maybe I'm complaining more because all they do is complain about things and maybe I'm being negative and feeling like nothing's ever gonna work because that's what they're also doing and being bitter about other people or people having bad attitudes about certain people and also like I don't like how I feel when you're around and sometimes you just have to distance yourself this is your life and you're guiding it where you want to go so you need to make sure that you're taking care of your life your mind your thoughts and your future this can also be you know I've had friends where I've seen they're hanging around their friends just like to party and are doing nothing with their lives and I can see where my friend has really great opportunities but they're missing out on them because they're just hanging out with their party friends and are doing nothing other than just like in party having fun mode all the time and that can be an area where you need to separate yourself too because you're going to go down that path you want to have friends that are making you feel better making be a better you and having positive friends really can do that especially if you have dreams or goals or things you want to go after and having a negative friend really can work against anything you're trying to do they'll make you feel bad for pursuing good things they'll be really negative about your ideas maybe they're negative about how you dress how you look how you act if they are there making fun of you telling you bad things that is not a friend and immediately you need to remove that person from your life whatever it is just distance yourself don't talk to them or you if you feel like you need to tell Mike hey I feel like you're being really negative it's probably not going to get a good response we're gonna be like no I'm not or it's probably just gonna be a negative situation so it's best just to slowly distance yourself from that and I've had to do that from friends in my life where I felt so much better once I wasn't around their negativity and that bad energy all the time just making me feel like oh the world is such a helpful place maybe uh awful maybe everybody available you need to be around positive people so I say make sure that you surround yourself with positive people be or be around people that you like how they treat people they're kind they're accepting they're open they're fun they're happy they're not putting other people down they're not putting you down they're not putting your dreams down and that you want to be around people to inspire you with what they're doing with their life do they have dreams and goals they're going after you almost like I'm not gonna do anything I'm just gonna do nothing with my leg because nothing is worth doing anything for that is not great after a while you can encourage them and you can be in source of inspirations to them and then once you realize it's not working they're just being negative and dragging your life down it's time to find a whole new sphere it doesn't matter because who has five people around maybe people have five people usually people have like one friend so if you have the one friend you're like that's the only friend of that it does matter because it's better to be alone and work on going to a positive place than it is to have one negative friend pulling your life down so that is my inspiration for the day I hope it helped one of you guys out if you feel that it did and you feel somebody could use this share this video wherever you want and make sure that you guys follow me on twitter all over those places twitter facebook snapchat okay Instagram Instagram just candy johnson everywhere so you guys can get I try to do inspirational stuff every day on different ones on all those different places so um I hope you guys saw my encouragement combos below what you want next week's video to be about and as always huge hugs from my house to yours I will see you guys in the next video I love you bye

cute coral in the middle and then just kind of pulled down onto the end so these ends were a lighter but then when I wash my hair all this ridges it just kind of stains everything so it stains just a little bit darker but I love it it's so beautiful and then just when I was like I am so sticking this red hair then I look in the mirror now I'm like I kinda like it but I think this will probably be the last the lasted um it's a lot of work to do the red but I love it all I've had it I really did like the blue but that's way too much work to do I was even thinking she made it like mermaid length so it's like extra long but really this afternoon I was just like I want to cut it short like -

[Music] hi guys it's candy and today we are going to be doing a no makeup makeup look that's right I don't have any makeup on but I know this seems like kind of counterproductive and I know in high school a lot of guys do it as well that you don't wear any makeup not like what I saw 45 minutes to look like I don't have anything on my face when I was clearly putting my makeup on but apparently I was already killing the no makeup makeup game so I've been acing that for a year so I'm going to share with you guys some tips and tricks so you do four kind of flawless but just you want to step out put a little something on so you just look a little less red and blotchy a little more like you got eyelashes there and a little more that your brows are doing a little something so if you guys have not make sure you put subscribe subscribe and join the candy family and following on snapchat Twitter Instagram and Facebook go to Twitter or Facebook for inspirational and funny coast not to null makeup and makeup reviews over on the snapchat and an Instagram they just look mostly I will have the makeup on to give you makeup ideas maybe some wardrobe ideas I don't know so follow me all of those places and let's get stuff is making it look like we don't have makeup on but who we do so any guy watching this and look what no world are you watching this video for but you guys know you know why you are watching this video and there will be some guys we like yeah I know to first I start off just putting my like moisturizing oil on my face because you always want to put a moisturizer even if you have dry skin to kind of even and smooth out the skin and then your makeup is going to go on even more flawless on top of that okay so the funny thing is is like I love wrestle-1 everybody else I think they're adorable and to put on my face for some reason I don't like them I don't know why I think they're cute on anybody else who has no fake freckles so I'm going to show you guys like the most natural purpose but still looking like real skin seeing some freckles and things like that and I got inspired because Bobbi Brown said need is big box of awesome awesome makeup so basically all of these different there's liquid foundations I'm going to show you how we're going to pick these out too so these are the foundation sticks - these are also one of the first high ends well because I had my makeup kit when I first started make Abarth like 80 million years ago father brown statement even behind it if you want women to look like their skin is real but just the most perfect real looking skin and I think that is what's great about this also a lot of times when you go to find foundation the DOE Heldman everybody shade and I think Bobby Brown's mission has been for a really long time that she doesn't want any woman to go to the counter and not be able to find their shades so there's like 30 shades that you guys can choose from to pick the one that's perfect for you so I'm going to let you guys be the judge what do you think of my skin looking more perfected and there as it can be you guys will be the judge so you know I like me some flawless coverage and if you guys want some facts on this this is I have sunscreen in it it's hydrating so it's great for you have you know dry skin to oily skin this will perfectly blend for everybody and it's water-based so all of that is great for you we're going to cancel out all the redness in the skin this is going to add hydration to the skin which is what we want and if you guys want to find these you can get these a support and a big shout out to Bobbi Brown thank you for sponsoring this video sending me all these foundations to try and inspire this look and um there's woods video a to watch in the video because maybe some open a window foundation course though so let's get started I'm going to show you guys how we're going to match these so I'm going to take three different shades we've got warm beige natural and base so they all look pretty similar but this is a dilemma when you go into the department store you're like what the foundation is going wrong so I want to put three different swipe aru's of these on my face give these guys a little shake I don't know if they need that one I just select shaking help stings so this is warm beige and we're going to put him right here in the center he's looking good he's looking good already can you see that now we're going to try just regular beige let's put regular beige over here closer to the mouth oh boy regular beige is maybe looking a little better actually and then what I've laughing at least natural natural we're going to put natural back here near my ear so I got these three to go from when I look the mirror here hmm you want the one that kind of just disappears into your skin so I'm just going to give these guys a blender just a smidgen more hmm what do you guys think which of these three do you think goes better I think it's kind of this front one we just put regular basis when I'm out I think he is the winner we're just going to put him all over so for this look we're just going to put him everywhere like with a moisturizer and this we're still going to see the freckles and things but look though and behold it's gotten rid of the redness around the mouth which is what I don't like this is fast you could do this fast is going to run errands in the morning once you have your own foundation picked out in your routine you can literally just pump it on your fingers rolling around your face like you would your moisturizer on top I'm just doing the Kazon in place you keep letting the technique and you could do it much faster I mean for me loving like a really heavy full coverage I am pretty incredibly impressed like it does this look like this is my skin and it just looks perfect it doesn't look like I have makeup on at all and it's really light it doesn't feel heavy or cakey so this is the key to your perfect foundation I'm going to put a smoothie down here now if you guys wanted to be complicated it's not complicated because this is what I do every single day I always put like a darker shade foundation on also I am going to be using warm almond it's a foundation stick and it's quite a bit darker but I'm just going to take it to do like a little bit of a little contour to get a little glow to the face because we're not going to be using much else now look what what the heck we'll just do it on the nose too right there you guys haven't seen my contouring video I have one called how to contour like a contouring artist and it really does teach you there's a lot of things online showing you one way to contour for a face and that doesn't work because each of our faces have different shapes and structures so in the video I kind of go into that and I'll put a link below if you guys want to master the arts of that so this is just going to give you a little bit of color and a little bit of glow on the face and it's really just going to give you that perfected skin look I mean this is crazy because like I can see my freckles and I'm not hating I am NOT a freckle later right now a regular beige and we're just going to a little bit more on Minos I mean it's not settling into any lines it's like kind of plumping up the skin books almost forgot about that that would have been weird you can also take I have the lighter stick and if you wanted to do underneath the eye this is an area where I would kind of pay attention to and then the eyelids because that skin is so thin and it gets like purpley I use a little bit of a lighter shade just to do the under eye area if you don't know under eye circles you could totally skip this part but sometimes some of us didn't get to sleep too much now you can set this with powder if you want to if you're going to do an eye shadow look or something like that I'm just going to use sheer finish pressed powder and pale yellow so I'm just going to dab this underneath the eye and on the eyelids whenever you're doing a no makeup makeup look you want to keep it light I'm going to just dab the eyebrows because I'm going to fill them and I want them to be dried with and to be oily with foundation and like if your nose is oily or wherever you don't have to like set the whole face unless you have like those kind of spots where you want to do that if you want to do this is optional for is no makeup or you may be like that's too many steps I'm not going to do that this is from Too Faced if you chocolate Soleil bronzer and I love it because it smells like chocolate and I'm just going to dab it here on the side you also totally don't have to do this at all you can just move along right past this step and also you can go ahead and use a cream blush which is what you'd want to do if you want a more dewy glowy blessed look but I'm going to use this powder it's stay pretty from Mac and I'm just going to dab him right here just so we get a little bit of a flushed glow beautiful now I'm just going to use like a nude color eyeshadow this is the eye University for my round I got this in the box they sent me two and I just kind of love these colors so I'm just going to take ivory this light color and I'm just going to sweep that under the brow for a light color and you put gifted you could just do powder right here too and then sweep it on down and then this toilet I really love is the nude on nude palette and I'm just going to take this color and what what would it be called this nude and I'm just going to sweep that on to my eyelid like so for that new time I and then you don't have to do if you could just put your mascara I'm out but I'm going to take this nude color and a little bit of this cement shade and I'm going to go right underneath our lash line just to give it like a little depth of our lashes without actually putting any eyeliner on so we're just putting this it's kind of like a warm warm e gray tone it's just going to give like definition there without being like an eyeliner so it's still going to look like oh you have this beautiful nude bare eye and then I'm going to curl my lashes because that makes the biggest difference in the world if you are not doing that you need to start curling your lashes look we went a little crazy over on outside for a bit and then I'm going to take the Too Faced better than sex mascara which is one of my favorites woah can you see the difference these lashes like sticking up and these are not I have to make them curl I have to get closer to the roots and then do it closer to where they're growing out is what I meant to say there you go there you go lashes and I'm just going to apply a couple coats of this increasing about this mascara is it really does make it look like you have really thick and long lashes okay so I'm going to go back in and I'm going to do the bottom lashes after this dries but let's do a little bit of brow while we're waiting and for this I have been trying something new which I heard about so this is from math is dip down the pro longwear fluid line and I'm going to take this and my angled brush it is a little more fluid than the most brow products so I'm just going to fill in my brows really Leslie my eyebrows are like black and this is like a brown so it's a little warmer that's the one thing like any time I do a no makeup look I always make sure that my just having your brows done will make the biggest difference a little light get you strokes you're just filling in the spaces kind of like if your eyebrows were connect the dots with little dashes you're just filling them in and making them look more angular and noticeable for me I like this inner corner for more defined and then I just give them a brush around like so and I do like this is a little more warm than my darker eyebrows that are just like black and then just like a dark brown tada I've got eyebrows okay now I'm going to take our mascara and we're going to do our lower lashes now a tip what you want to make your eyebrows look more softer is just take your powder and you're a little Beauty Blender sponge and you just dab right on top of the brows that you just did and this is going to diffuse the color and soften and light them just like you would if you have like your blond should something is to darken you go back over at the powder to soften it that will work too so now our finishing cuts the PS the result is going to be our lips so if you also want to look nude and I am looking for my nude lip liner because I love me a lip liner even if I'm doing a no makeup makeup look define those babies so this is perfect spice from Too Faced and I'm just going to line the edges myself and I love the over line so they're doing that you guys know that I love me a liquid that but a liquid that is hard to do with a no makeup look because it does look like your lips have been painted a color I do love this this is from Tom Ford it's called chastity look at this pink look at this dreamy pink I love this color and then you just put this on so it almost it looks like like the most amazing exquisite consid lip balm and then you didn't dab it right on top the lip liner so it doesn't look like you've got lip liner on 2:51 still too heavy you can block it off and that's it guys this is our no makeup makeup look you don't want to do any crazy like creamy highlighting things because then it looks like well very noticeable because highlighting highlighters noticeable new me like whoa yep you do have a lot of makeup on so what a nice thing I know you guys can see like freckles and things do we love it do we hate it what do we think I really am impressed let me get my mirror back out I feel like this looks really dewy and glowy my final thoughts are I can see my freckles and I kind of love them actually and it got rid of like some of the sauce that I don't like and it definitely got rid of all of the redness so I will say it does look like this is my natural skin and it just looks really perfect like as perfect as my natural skin can look which is kind of amazing like it looks like I just have really perfect skin and no makeup on but I have makeup on let me know some other just quick makeup well two other things you guys want to do and what is your final result guys what do you think of the more

once upon a time the litter being a beautiful princess in a land far far away her name was Bell this is not your ordinary Bell there are some twists routines you see once upon a time there was pin-up Belle and in the twist in our story we're also gonna tender about rockabilly Belle Foundation Beauty Blender can you bring it to me please oh that was so fast thank you now whether you're doing pinup makeup or princess makeup you want perfect flawless foundation I'm using the bourne sway foundations in two phase and i'm going to put a little bit of the kevin of quan sensual skin enhancer a big perfect concealer around the eyes and we can never forget to set our foundation with powder any translucent powder will work then i'm going to take a cream blush in pinky rose apply it on the cheeks and then a powder blush in the same color on top to lock it in place with a light pink highlight shimmer on top of the cheekbones now i'm going to take my nyx milk eyeliner pencil in white and apply this as a base on the inner corner of the eye spread it around with your fingers a little then take a yellow buttery frosty color and put it on the inner corners of the eyes you also want to dab it right underneath the brows for a little bit of highlight i'm going to take my Naked basics palette and any peach or nude shadow and blend that on top to soften the shimmer i'm also going to take a little bit more of the yellow and peachy colors and blend that on the rest of the eyelid then i'm going to take the warmer more yellowish shadows and blend those so we marry the bottom color up into our brow color then i'm going to take the naked smoky palette a little bit of this darker deeper peach and apply it in the crease I'm also going to tap it into the little topi gray color this is going to add more dimension in the crease we're not doing a cut crease or any kind of crazy blended it's more about very soft shading and contouring for the pin-up eye I'm taking hints of the gold coppery warm color and blending them on the middle part of the eyelid we're going to take a little more of that yellow Frost and add some more dazzle on the inner corner it's all about blending and layering once upon an eyebrow what we forgotten our brows I'm going to take my dip brow and an angled brush this is in medium brown and really fill in and define a crisp pin-up brow you really want to make sure the angles the tail of your brow and the inner corner are very defined this is a signature out for the pin-up look and now it's time for brown number two again really fill it in and makes you have very straight lines on the bottom in the top and really make sure that inner corner has a crisp point and beginning to it as well as the arch and the tail of the brow and now it's time for our classic pinup liner I'm taking jet black for anastacio Beverly Hills you can use any cream or gel liner you want you can even do this with a liquid liner and a small stiff angled brush you want to start at the outer corner then with gentle strokes and move in towards the corner of the eye and continue the wing from where the curve of the bottom of the lower lashes curves upward that's right where I curb the shape of the wing to continue up in that curved line next I start at the middle point and work your way towards the outer corner I stop at the outer corner of the eye and then gently work my way with the remaining part of the product on my brush to the inner corner of the eye and keep dragging it outwards to blend then again we work on drawing our little wing line and connect them together then you just go back over and fill them in now it's time for our next essential step curl in those lashes and then I'm going to apply a couple coats of mascara my favorite right now is these tarts camera lashes you always want to make sure you wiggle it in the bottom even though we didn't do any crazy lining on the bottom and coat those top lashes as much as you want I realized I want to go back with a little more dimension so I tapped the brown and peak together and really want to go into that crease to create a little more drama with the pin-up high so just right into the crease or push around the shape of your eyeball and that will create the illusion of a crease if you don't have one and then slightly blend up and outwards toward the brows just so you get some good blending going on then I'm going to take my more fluffy brush get a little bit of that stained brown but a little more of the lighter nude color on top and really help blend it from the crease all the way out towards our brow bones the key to doing nude eyes like a pinup eye like this is making it look very subtle and blended so you don't even notice the shading but it looks gorgeous sometimes in life and in makeup you have to stop to smell the roses and you might find a surprise like the perfect belle lip color you can use any hot pink or fuchsia lip color I'm using a liquid lip color from Jeffrey star just to provide our bright deep rose pink base then to add a little highlight and dimension I'm taking sweet-talker it's a liquid lip trap Anastacio beverly hills or any light rose pink will work also what is this the perfect lip liner this is cherry it's from Mac it's my favorite red lip liner of all time you can use any red lip liner that you have but this is just my favorite and you really want to perfect and shape the lips this is another key step to any pin-up look it looks like I don't have any teeth here but if you curl your lips inward it really straightens out the skin because you can't have any mistakes with a red lip one wobble and it's very evident to everyone so you really want to work on perfecting the lines and curves for your beautiful red liner which just looks like a deep pink when you put it next to the hot wait what is this hmm yet another color I'm going to be using lovely to add even more highlight dimension on the top this is going to really make the lips look amazing and people wonder what color you have on I just put it on the center and then dab it on my lips to kind of spread it and wait what hmm that isn't the right book let me get out my pinup makeup book again of course how could I forget the lashes every princess and pinup makeup looks needs lashes I'm gonna be using the flutter lashes in Kim I'm gonna put a light strip of blue very very thin and just place them on the outer edges of the eyes you simply place it on the eye and leave it on your finger and we're going to do two yep it's still not working this is just like life sometimes you have to try two or three times to get something right and voila our lashes are on but wait what are we missing yeah the most important part of all our pinup hairdo I'm gonna put on my wig cap so I totally look like an old Broadway star and carefully place this awesome pinup wig that I got at Hollywood wig Outfitters it was a little tricky because I didn't properly tuck my hair into the wig cap so you'll kind of see it later in parts of the video with driving me nuts but I really did not want to mess up this wig because it was so carefully styled and yes after reviewing all the steps in our book I think we perfectly accomplished our pin-up Belle makeup look it's double check yes everything looks right our poses even look right yes surprise ooh do a little dance always have a rose because we are Belle pose like a princess now this pin-up Bella is fun and beautiful and anybody can do it but here is the twist in our story for chapter 2 now we're going to go to rockabilly Belle we're just going to do a couple extra things little out a fun twist if you want a little bit of a change for this left I'm taking this fake flower which I pulled off a stem poking two holes with a pushpin in it so I can put my bobby pin or hair pin through these holes and attach it to the hair now I'm just gonna slide my hair pin through those holes and secure it right above my ear perfect but wait ah oh yes fake tattoos for dummies to add a little bit of an edgy twist to this rockabilly look we're gonna add some tattoos to the decollete Oh Louie can you please bring me my tattoo supply I forgot them too you're so fast all you're going to need is a paper towel that you fold into four then you're going to remove the outer plastic cover decide where you want to place your tattoo I got these rose tattoos at a defy calm then you're going to replace your damp paper towel on top until it moistens and loosens all the ink onto your skin and you can just do a little dance while you're waiting for your tattoo to come off the paper and it's time for Rose number one tada now it's time for number two we repeat all the steps remove the plastic place it on the skin wet our paper towel till it's very soaked and try not to spill it put it right on top dance away the tattoo time and and there we have our fake rose tattoos now you want to take any translucent setting powder and dust it on your fake roses this will help make your fake tattoo look well a little less fake well these roses are looking great oh I've got a little bit of an idea I'm going to take my black waterproof gel eyeliner and I thought I'd draw a little more detail just freehand to kind of connect these two roses and make it look a little more dramatic this is a 24/7 glide-on in perversion from urban decay then what else would I use besides my Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper to do some detail work on my take tattoo and there you have a more rockabilly belle so I hope you guys love teen pinup and a rockabilly belle

I don't have that actually at the moment um also favorite tools toys or man tweezers because oh there's a little hair bonus of mine in their tweets or man tweezers I use this everyday I pull at least one eyebrow hair out and if I don't my role here is start going down here they start growing up here and people on the left oh your eyebrows are so high I literally could make them grow down here

you guys know I'm obsessed with the Clinique beyond perfecting foundation the only problem is they don't have one shade that actually matches me perfectly so I have to mix like three so I've gone through a lot of bottles of this this year but I I love it I love a level of this a new favorite that I fell in love with towards the more I don't know I think I first use this in September why is my nose so itchy there's like a fuzzy thing on it just keep tickling my nose yeah okay so this is the YSL all ours foundation 24 we're flawless map full coverage this stuff is pretty amazing so he hasn't been a favorite of the all year but since September till now I wear them both everyday I put him on and then I put him for at this clinic beyond perfecting has more coverage than him so I'll put him all over it then where I need more coverage I put this on also okay then favorite powder hands-down Laura Mercier translucent powder if you never tried this this could be a game-changer game-changer right here when I was doing makeup is just a makeup artists before YouTube this was always always always in my kit and then I forgot about it and I was like trying all these other different powders

covered so they just covered up part so who the who bronzer but the hoola bronzer I love this stuff oh this is also oh my gosh this is our CMA this is one of my favorites I use it everyday when I'm doing contouring and stuff so this palette this is what I use when I'm contouring I use I use these two colors to contour on my face you can see how much darker they are and then I'll use these to do like nose contouring because it's got a more cool gray tone cuz you know want your nose looking bronze you want it look like a cool shadow and shadows are more gray so I use this shadow and then use these highlights to highlight to so this our CMA VK 11 palette most used use this all the time it's amazing if you're a makeup artist you need this palette in your life you have this palette this one

okay these are my two most used blushes he broke don't judge and he already hit Pam this is stay pretty from math I love this pink color and then this is spring flock so I'll do a DAB a--rewin both like doo-doo-doo put them on my cheeks you just get a flushed super flush glow I actually don't have any blush on today so we'll just put a little blush your Unni on oh there we go now I'm looking a little bit more alive oh I wouldn't look like this today - okay so that's what I put on there now we've got okay lip colors this is gonna be easy and it's gonna sound dumb because they're mine but these melted matte colors are from my eye long candy collection with Too Faced which is almost these maybe sold out now you can go to two-faced comments see but even if they are I'm just telling you what was my fav most used sweet and sour I'm wearing it today I've worn this I feel like every time I put makeup on I do this red lip and it's the sweet and sour which is from my color and then the freshly baked I'll put on the tropical punch but then I'll always put this is melted ice cream I dab it in the center with my finger after and then press it in like that and you get the perfect highlight of your lip there so these are two of my most I've worn these the most all the entire year long and then I wear this sweet and sour with cherry from Mac this lip liner because you know me guys I don't ever wear a lip color without a lip liner that's just how I do it that's just how I do have our roll so this is cherry lip liner and I where it was a sweet and sour I would never together by where these do and I might do a little highlight with that guy most used liquid eyeliner so Kat Von D in trooper I use this a lot like most all year I have like two or three of these just around my purse bathroom in case I lose one and then I also discovered oh my gosh this one this pretty easy Clinique liquid eyeliner pen this makes lining your eyes literally pretty so easy like the name is pretty easy and this is my new favorite liquid eyeliner this and they Clinique pretty easy okay well this was another of lip liner too so this is floor from Mac I wear these two lip liners the most for and cherry I would do store in the melted ice cream mostly store and then just this to highlight mister most warrant eyelashes the Kim lashes from flutter lashes and then this most use eyeshadow pub he's gonna sound again lame-o like I'm just promoting my stuff but this is my Too Faced I want candy eyeshadow and these are my basics so I wear these I designed this palette to be all the colors I wanted to wear every single day of my life like all my basics so I do wear this every single day of my life I use all these every day I use one of the eyeshadows from here I even use this whipped cream is like highlighter will do a little highlight on the nose I love this palette there might these might be available on toothpaste calm and I think they're going to Australia to a store called Mecca um in January once they're gone they're gone forever but I do and I've been using this even into 2016 because I was testing this eyeshadow palette out before it launched so I've been wearing this baby every day for like longer than a year now and what we're down to the very end oh oh my gosh okay another thing was my favorite and this is not just because I was testing them out I have gone through so many bottles of my shampoo this is my oh gee at sparkling cider shampoo its sulfate free it's amazing at everyday one of my kids hair smells like this this is the sparkling cider which you guys they made me a can love this because I said it should be a candle it's amazing and then there's also the frosted sugar cookie and the candy gumdrop I can't even how many bottles of these we have gone through like so many because we're so excited to use them so these are mine from OGX and they'll be gone for the holidays too so if you want in hurry and go get those babies and I just can't even believe this year I've got to do my makeup and the shampoo and there are real things I I worked so hard to make them amazing and I love them so much I wouldn't use them every single single day okay so I have to add this in because I totally forgot that this but after I feel the video I realized I forgot to tell you guys about something which I use so this is a lip plumping tool this little suction thing but you use it like long ways like this like you do that and so I use this all the time oh this is what it's called full lips full lips is what it's called I used to use another one called lip toufool and they were hand made they were made out of clay but the problem is I dropped a lot of them and then they would be cracking off time so I got this one at nanny's and then it just creates like a really full looking mouth and totally looks like you just got lip injections just by using this you can totally plump this thing up so I use this all the time I think I actually even bought two of them I use this guy probably every day to leave them plump for like a few hours or I think over time it like creates more fullness in the lips like I really do think that that happens so um so I use this guy and that was it those are all my beauty things you guys you guys have been the best people I just want to tell you guys thank you so much for just when you guys leave me loving and

switched me in grace helbig's character so it says candy Johnson is playing cookie sugar loaf in the credits when that is grace helbig's character and then my character is Mandy startled us we just said grace Helbig was playing so um I realized this mistake when I saw the movie at the premiere and they can't fix it in time for the theatres because um it's too short notice to correct it but when it comes out on DVD it will be correct it will say candy Johnson as men do sparkled us cuz me and Mandy run candy and Mandy and she is like the designer of the hug from a friendship places that the

hey guys it's candy and I have a kind of special video I'm gonna try not to get upset talking about this this video is dedicated to a few of my friends that are dealing with a lot of bullying and hate kind of things going on and this is where anybody else out there that is going through those things also the first thing I want you to know that we kind of can all relate with even if people were telling you awesome things all day long like you're great you're wonderful you're beautiful all those kind of things it can take like one comment of something like you're an idiot you're stupid you're ugly something like that you should kill yourself whatever they're gonna say and then that becomes the only thing that you can get like fixated on where you're like you cannot stop thinking about that one thing I have done this too and let me just give you an example so I've been doing YouTube for like 7 years now I think pretty much I've been told all different things for all these years I've been told I'm ugly I look like a man I don't know I should kill myself I'm stupid I don't have talent my voice is annoying or all kinds of things I have been told pretty much anything I think you could tell somebody that's mean I'm pretty sure I've been told those things if not I'll probably get told them soon I don't know but but one thing I have learned in this is that you can't focus on those things that that person saying because especially online or on the computer you don't know the mental state of the person saying those things they're probably having a bad day they're probably super angry and hurt themselves the one thing I do know is a lot of people you can look at them and they look like they're normal people but on the inside you don't know how much they they have been hurt they are hurting they're depressed they're miserable they're sad and usually those people that those wounded people that wound others is the hurt people that hurt others that is very true because you never meet a loving kind person that is mean to another person they are being loving and kind it's always somebody that's bitter and angry and hurt and they're the ones that stay bitter and angry and hurt things and this is just a case of that's just what happens and a lot of times I saw this thing recently that was really cool and it was an article I was talking about there's two different kinds of TV there's the kind that are inspiring and you get inspired you learn something you feel better after you've watched it and then there's the other kind of TV words but voyeuristic like a reality TV where you're watching other people's drama and the problems in their life and somehow when you're done watching it you feel better because you're oh yeah their life is worse than mine and that's the two different kind of scenarios I personally would want to watch something where I feel better after having watched it instead of being like oh yeah their lives are so miserable now I feel not so bad about my miserable life and that's kind of what people do with their comments also if they're feeling like they're having a miserable down life or they're not going anywhere then they're like oh yeah I'm gonna say all kinds of bad things about you I've never met awesome and great and loving and inspiring people that go around saying awful and mean things to people personally I myself I have never taken the time to if I don't like something like if I see a video or picture something where I don't I don't agree with it don't like it it upsets me or bothering me for some reason I will never never in my mind would occurred me would be like this is still playing you don't know what you're doing you're out of town you're uh that just doesn't even pop into my mind to do that nor would it do that on somebody's Instagram comment Twitter anything like that I'm not gonna say something mean or tear anybody down but I will tell you this the people that are tearing other people down they're coming from an insecure place where they feel bad about themselves they're hurt they're miserable they're unhappy because happy people are not gonna do that loving kind of people are not gonna do that so the words that come out of people's mouths are truly telling of what's inside their heart so acqua mean hurtful things coming out their mouth awful or hurtful things are happening inside of their heart loving happy awesome people speaking loving happy awesome words I guarantee you like 100 percent of time I've told a story before of this girl wrote these things like you wrapped your face no talent blah blah blah she wrote this all over my Instagram how ugly I was look like a man and that comment back to her she was pretty and I put it's so sad that a girl that is still beautiful as you would let such ugly words come out of her mouth she began this whole dialogue of how her she was upset sad what a bad day she was having she ended up saying she loved me so much and didn't know how she could feel so much love for me and especially a side note you don't ever want to reply if somebody leaving hateful things don't go join their Pigpen of hate don't go in it don't go in there it's foolish to go in there to step into their cage and be like oh yeah I don't tell you this there's nothing you can say that's going to talk them out of their thought process you just don't go in there especially unless it's coming from a loving place where I'd be like I'm sorry you hate my hair they'll hope you have an awesome day as long as it's loving and kind I would still say probably you don't even need to waste your time there but don't go sink into somebody's pity party an awful pit within life I just say ugly things over here to everybody and I'm mad and angry in the world learning to know it don't go join that don't go be relay or don't sink to their level you stay up where you're at and and just remember to be who you are be true to who you are don't let somebody's hate also make you afraid but you're like oh I can't wear that because then I'm gonna get hated on I can't say that cuz then I'm gonna get hated on I can't do this cuz they'll all get here don't live in fear that either you have to boldly go where you want and don't care about those people comments it's sad that nowadays we live in this world where everybody's so big and bold and talk behind their computer like oh well tidy allow how this about your eyeliner this about your outfit is about how ugly you are and they would not tell you these things to your face but somehow people get this little boldness behind their computer to really wash out and wrapped it out at everybody else so don't feel bad about anything people are doing you be you and know that their words are just they're just projecting a big picture of what really is going on in their heart in their life and if anything that is the most sad state for people to be in if anybody is not successful if they're miserable they're unhappy they're feeling unloved they're gonna definitely hate somebody that is doing anything a little better than they are a little successful all those kind of things it can be your friends your family your strangers people online um people you think are friends on Facebook did nobody's parents teeth them if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it at all like I don't know what's happening like we're this generation is just getting so rude yeah I can say whatever I want that is my opinion I have freedom of speech well you shouldn't have freedom to hate freedom to attack people freedom to say mean things and rip on people like why would you I don't understand people's mindsets that they would even let those kind of words come out of your mouth if you don't like something don't watch it if you don't like somebody on Instagram just quit following them don't leave a whole paragraph and comment and then there's really crazy people to get super obsessed and maybe they're starting a whole devotion they just want to like hate stock you don't want to see everything you're doing so they can hate anything our shows just how crazy much crazier that that whole concept is like go on with your life and go do things I would never obsess over wondering what someone's doing to hate on I'm like that is just a sign of something that doesn't have healthy healthy mental outlook healthy just mental workings at all so I just want you guys to be encouraged don't listen to what people are saying if people are saying mean things on your social media delete and block them you don't need that this is your party this is your world you're like inviting people in your house if someone's gonna come to your house and be rude they don't they're not invited to your Instagram party house anymore kick them out you need to rid yourself of that stuff even if you are following someone on Twitter Instagram Facebook or something that their posts just make you angry or upset or maybe they right near snarky post or maybe it's just a bunch of materialistic things and you're tired of seeing you know whatever it is they're posting you don't need to unfollow that you just need to find the peace in your life even if you need to take a break from social media go to something you like go see a movie go painting go drawing go make music go what read a book do something that you love to do that isn't online that is like you need a real break for me a good thing to do is go walking and go running it like clears my head it gets all that junk out I listen to good music and I go for a run and I just process I just get all the junk out so go and do that if you need to don't feel bad about these hateful miserable people that are just like pumping their hate out into the world and don't let that affect you cling to the good and resist if you know there's people online talking about you whether it's on Facebook it's a group of friends whether it's on Instagram whether it's anywhere you go that there's people talking about you hate with hateful evil something don't go there nothing good is gonna come of it you don't need to see what they're writing you don't need that to affect your brain protect this little precious mind of yours and keep it safe from those people by blocking deleting don't go see that nothing Goods gonna come don't engage don't go to the Pigpen of their mud and mire of hate and disgust leave them in there don't cast your precious pearls before the swine that are gonna trample you up with their evil and awful things because that's not a wise place you want to be careful where you put yourself where you put your thoughts where you put your mind you are a precious pearl and protect that very much though I just wanted to encourage you guys for the precious friend that you know I was I just knew that I wanted to make this video for you and for everybody else going through all these things know that I love each and every one of you you are so precious and anytime anybody says anything negative to you know that I've been told negative things all the time every day about everything how I look how I act how I dress how I talk I like everything you can think of there's probably somebody that's gonna try to find something to hate about this very video um so I just want you to know that I love you I'm encouraging you hear my voice saying I love you I think you're awesome you're precious you unique you're creative you're funny you're your own unique little snowflake in this world now go out in the world and stand out in the Forster green you'll be that hot pink tree that stands out and is different and don't care what the people think if you care so much what people say and hate you'll never do anything you'll never go out and live your life and they're just gonna live this miserable awful depressing angry sad life because that's all they have balled up in them you go out and shine and be your own thing and don't care there's always gonna be haters now that there's the computer in online there's no more hateful people than ever before so we just got to learn a new way to deal with them and it's like don't don't listen to them and it's like if they were spewing out like a virus and a bacteria because their heart is full of all this ugly dirt blood just get away from them get away from the disease people like quarantine yourself and then when you see your it's like oh well you're you're a sick one alright I'm not gonna listen you so when you see those hateful comments just delete them don't replace like oh you don't even know you don't even know what's going on in that person's mind where their their mental state is not in a healthy place and just ignore all of that know that I love you I will see you guys in the next video if

[Music] I feel like everything I've done was a mistake that should be the life motto if ever you have problems blended out honestly my biggest blind girl tip is like over blend over blending is my best friend cuz I'm like well if anything looks horrible I'll just really really blend it out I don't know what I'm doing at chili hi guys today I have a very special guest this is my friend Molly we just finished a challenge video over on her channel so I'm gonna put the link down below it is the guest guest the youtubers voice challenge it was so hard it was so fun great thanks Molly we won't tell you that we won't tell you the results at all but we're gonna do a challenge here and we're gonna do the ten minute no mirror makeup challenge which was Molly's idea because Molly is blind and so she doesn't like she doesn't have a mirror every day which is amazing to me and you'll be amazed by all of her videos so go subscribe to her and Molly do you want to tell everybody like what is the story of how you became blind yeah so I was born with a rare genetic disease called retinitis pigmentosa which basically is the slow deterioration of a layer in your eye called the retina and so when I was 14 years old I ended up losing the majority of my vision I'm 23 now although I look 14 without my makeup you cute little baby face so I it's been nine years as a blind person and I'm a makeup and fashion lover I'm obsessed with all it is amazing to me and which I also love because I also say that beauty is something that should be felt in a darkroom it should be something that is less about being seen with your eyes and more about being felt in your car yes absolutely people are always like why do you like makeup if you can't see body like fashion I'm like it's not about that it's not about just looking in a mirror they're not into makeup and why you start watching YouTube and things so it's telling candy like I grew up loving fashion and makeup and when I lost my vision I was like how do I now love something so visual without me seeing it anymore and so I had to figure it out I can't read magazines to look at what's cool and trendy and learn how to do things so I went to YouTube I started watching people like you and watching makeup tutorials and I would hear somebody say things like oh you know X lipstick is my favorite everyday lipstick so then I would go out and buy it yeah where that is my lipstick is like they told me it was the best one right and so I would just do that and yeah it just really was empowering for me to figure out how to do my makeup in my fashion and pick out outfits without being able to see any of it so now I do my makeup every day without a mirror I've never done makeup with the mirror so I thought it would be kind of fun to see who can do the better speed round full bath of make up the real makeup artist or the blind person who does everyday I'm gonna guess it's still probably you I don't know and after this we're going to a YouTube event we're at VidCon right now so I told Molly that if she I will fix anything wrong and we will fix anything wrong with my face real fun be like what happened a candy she used to be so tell dude I don't know I don't know what happened and we're both gonna do bright red lips I'm even gonna try to do a winged liner maybe we'll see how it goes so we're gonna have our 10 minute timer are you ready to shoot start okay count us down okay so here we go starting okay try my foundation well you're not even doing primer I'm gonna save me all the stuff I'm not even gonna do I'm not even gonna like read like do anything up I'm just gonna try to get this isn't even coming out of the bottle so this isn't even going well for me already I'm doing foundation with my hands you're doing a great job you ever used the Beauty Blender I love them you know how when today I know I should have I would have brought you one mine's up and up in the room up in the sink just spots the Ecotools sponge to try out oh and you're gonna see how that compares yes and I bought the what's the other one I bought another one to try I just want to test them all out this is a lot harder I'm just like guessing that I'm doing this right the worst part is what is the hardest part you feel the worst is mascara for sure really yeah because I like I can't see the wand so it's just like and you don't know when you're gonna come out your face yeah hutch it exactly so I always use like sample size mascaras mini mascaras because my lack of a wand because it's less one so my hand is closer to my face that's good do I have more control I literally this is I also never know what to cover up so like if I feel bumps on my face if I have like acne or anything I'll cover that up but your sign is amazing thank you you're welcome I didn't know I'm like I guess I'll do under my under my eyes because I don't know if there's dark circles or not so we'll just couple better be they think oh I didn't even know if I want to try it you contouring I don't know this is a bad idea I love my settings what do you want what I'm still contouring what the heck and I use this color that's really dark I feel like this was a lot of bad ideas all of a sudden I was telling you about the new series I start on my channel yeah but learning is where I try new beauty hacks and beauty techniques and what has been your worst one well I cried oh my god I tried contouring how did how do you know that was interesting people actually like I feel like you could you could figure it out like people are like I feel like it wasn't that bad really they're like I feel like the Shady's was like a little to oranjee and not right for everybody because a lot of them come out in funny colors so I'm good but next video I'm gonna try cream contour so I try oh my gosh you're upping the state yes I'm gonna try cream I feel like I should not have done the liquid contouring I feel like that was a bad decision I wonder how far we'll both get oh how much time do we have [Music] what so the worst part is the palettes I know you can only color nice to figure out where all the products are are you serious okay I feel like I have a cheater thing because I can see the color and choosing yeah well you also don't do your makeup without Amir ever know I don't know I already have that advantage so you get a vantage of being able to see the products at least yeah it's like it even though yeah we kinda like balanced sort of seven minutes the whole head is like I do this every day of my life so for me this was not as easy as it is many years ago right like for you right now this is really hard yeah never done it before no me I do every day of my life and so I've adapted and I've adjusted and I think that's the big thing with disabilities people are like oh look how hard it is right it's not hard for me now right now like this is challenging for you and Jonas thinks I'm under like a time restraint yeah but it's not challenging when you live it every day being blind is my normal right you know every day I text with a voice app and I walk around with a guide dog and you know choose your guide dog as a door well he's the best such such an age so you just adapt to your new normal you just adapt and it becomes normal and how would you get through that time when you started to feel like I knowing that you were going to go blind I feel like so many people would become so depressed or feel like we're talking about depressing how did you don't work not much depression I don't want to press you did you get through that well I'm very lucky I had a very supportive family and I recognize how truly fortunate I am to have had that and I wish everybody did because that's really what got me through and you know got me a lot of help admitting that I needed to seek professional help and I like counseling like that yeah therapy I needed to go to therapy and I needed to you know see people who were going to help me recover I worked on you know physical health through through nutrition and yoga and spirituality and just all these different things to explore and you know finding independence again by able to like by being able to express myself through fashion to make up again and teaching myself how to do things that I love in a new way like that was really empowering for me and now I get to share it with people through videos and you know I'm a motivational speaker as well so I get so she just spoke at the UN that's how amazing lolly is it was pretty amazing it was a very cool experience I was super honored to be able to do that um do you fill in your eyebrows I started the liminal hardest thing I think I've only started fill the hair yeah it's--that's-- see I only started playing the man where this is on the hair I think I should have left my eyebrows alone I should get it I think if you had a straw you can figure the line I kind of brush like backwards what I like I thought I've only just started doing brows sorry you missed me like just now getting weight how much time do we have we have oh my gosh that's not enough time or anything I've done my full face I can't obviously I'm not saying that it won't be as good as it usually try to do this is like liquid eyeliner but again this is a mistake I feel like everything I've done was a mistake I should have done a barefaced now it is mascara it's the true no makeup name four minutes my wings are gonna take me much longer I don't know how blended that black shadow liner is top but I'm not doing underneath okay I don't know what I'm doing actually I feel this those are gonna be their wings but I am gonna curl my lashes I will do that how much time we have to do the lips they'll take a long time okay I'm on the brow so I hate new mascara I gotta blend this and then I shadow because I think if you blend a bad liquid liner it kind of makes it better you just have to blend enough if you just blend everything away honestly my biggest blind girl tip is like over blend over blend which I did have time times over blend today but over blending is my best friend cuz I'm like well if anything looks horrible I'll just really really blend it out so it won't look horrible anymore that should be the life motto if ever you have problems blend it out well blend it out is that the name of your series for real you know it should be though it should be that's the new name blended I wait I forgot my mascara oh my goodness okay the cabinet I shouldn't I should have to do I'm gonna do lips now okay I'm done mascara I'm gonna do the mascara right now my Peaks are so hard especially with red the red is hard because if you get a wobble that's going in the wrong way I know it's not it doesn't is not forgiving doing red lipstick fast and no mirror I mean for me it's just doing it fast but you did a great job I'm going to be very delightfully and increasingly surprised really really fast doing how much time curling so now we have 2 minutes and 7 seconds oh I can actually just Sanne I didn't my mouth so I'm not gonna talk because I will mess it up what I'm gonna you can talk as much as you want Molly I'm doing lashes which is also difficult to talk well it is like rain Thursday doing the under lashes hi as I said this is usually the part where like all sometimes get it on the inside of my nose because I can't oh that's everybody's problem I do that cute sorry girls dude yes and on the upper part of your eyelid and the outer corner oh I never get that I don't know what's happening here I'm like so stressed I feel like my hand is shaking I'm like oh my god will you tell us in 15 second increments yeah so okay so we have one minute and second I'm gonna make you feel a lot better you are because I'm gonna tell you the good news is I mean I switch to sing as big numbers 60 60 I'm done not busy do your lips I dare ya okay you already being trying I'll just go over the 25 seconds I feel like this feels right but I don't feel like it looks right yeah when you're are you doing a liquid lipstick or a lemon-basil orbit lip liner I did a liquid eyeliner but I think it was terrible idea I always use the like the tip to like feel like when I used a lip gloss or something like you just feel in their line yeah you device it doesn't feel right to me I feel like I did this I feel like I did it wrong already as I said you like develop techniques okay I'm done we did it before the town really should I look at what I did yeah yours looks beautiful I don't know about that I felt so pressured usually I wouldn't do it my full face in ten minutes so this how long does it normally take you I'd say 15 20 I did say it's the same thing yeah okay how do you learn what I mean I there's some powder in between my eyebrows this isn't too bad but if I didn't do the liquid liner I think that's where I really went wrong yeah I see I don't do look with that now with the big mistakes products I've learned blind girls need to stay away from and there is products I've learned this is my best friend and I get sick to the best friend products and that's what my new series is all about it's trying the ones it's like Oh probably not it's you they're friendly I feel like this yeah if I didn't do the liquid liner I feel like that's really I kind of blend it in the contouring I was afraid and eyebrows don't look so C terrible like I said like if not you're eight I'm ever doing it one without a mirror and two under time constraint and if we had ten more if you did this every day for nine years like you're like you would be able to do your makeup just as well as you can do it now with the mirror and that's that's the reality is we we learn we adapt we change I can do everything anybody else can do I just do it in a slightly different way sometimes it might take me longer but sometimes I do it faster so yeah things are actually easier when you don't have sight and that's what I love to share with people it's like I do you think I can sense something because how you're saying like you can sense people's moods or personalities just by their vibe the end like how do you feel because there could be somebody that could be like looking beautiful to the eyes but their attitude is something that is very an ugly thing so you're what do you I don't think I like the other acted like what do you feel when you feel like that's a beautiful person like is it their kindness is it you can just feel an energy about them yeah I think it's an energy it's how they interact with people it's you know there's I mean there's so many amazing people you know here that Han and I'm sure you know like you just feel it yeah you feel like the good people's energy feel this like gel you know gelling and I'm I don't have to be distracted by like the physical I'm just go straight to the core which is yeah you can strip to the heart of people blind girl perk yeah girl wins in life and unfortunately people look at disability and are like oh they can't do this yeah oh this is missing in their life oh that would be so difficult right and it's all these negative words that we use when we talk about disability but there's so many positives to being disabled and that's what I like sharing with people like the amazing things disabilities brought into my life and it's not to negate the negative because there are negatives and there are challenges but there's negatives in your life there's challenges in your life I always say that having sight wouldn't take away problem it would take away certain problems that I live with but I would they would just be replaced by other problems yeah right we and so I've learned to adapt to the problems I have so I'll just keep these ones I'm gonna keep these oh I'll live without the sight if it means facing access issues with my guy dog because it also means having amazing opportunities like being here with you right now you have to go to her

have to put away look at all the makeup look at the room 
hi guys it's candy and today I want to inspire you guys with a message this is life and 5 reasons to stay alive because I know sometimes there are probably all of you watching this at one time they thought I can't go on I don't feel like I can keep going on one of those kind of thoughts and if you haven't maybe you're going to go through something up ahead in the future that's going to make you feel those ways and I want you guys to remember these things because you can be grocery shopping you could see somebody driving a car next to you and you don't know how close do not wanting to deal with life anymore that they are and even else on a daily basis like those overwhelming and too much and just really hard so I want to start with a few things number one is you were meant to be here for a reason no matter what family you're born into or what circumstances you're dealing with you're here for a reason you have dreams and gifts and fingerprints that are all uniquely yours nobody has those same ones in the same way that you do and you are here for a reason always remember that when you feel like why am I even here what is my purpose you are here for a purpose and everything that is in you that makes you who you are was done for a purpose and there's nobody else like you with your laugh with your creativity your voice your style your sense of humor everything that is all unique to you that is something that nobody else is going to have and somebody needs you in this world number two even though life seems so difficult and this can be family situations friends situations relationship situations those people on the outside of you can have a huge influence and impact in your life and I want you to know that they don't have to all those people whether it's a relationship and you feel like you're not loved you're not worthwhile you're not beautiful you're not any of those things or it's outside people your friends just make you feel like they don't invite you to think you don't fit in you don't have enough of them or can be your family that's putting you down saying you're worthless you're not good enough you're not pretty enough you're waste of time you were an accident you weren't meant to be born all those things made coming in from the outside too and I want you to know those things do not matter many people came from families that spoke against them their careers their goals the things they wanted to do and they still went on and did them anyway it can also be that you have friends around you they're making you feel bad a relationship that are making you feel bad if you are choosing to be in a relationship or choosing to have friends that make you feel that way 1 they're not friends and 2 that's not somebody you want to be in a relationship with 3 the family that's something that's a little trickier because you got it live with them or especially if you're under 18 but know that one day you're going to get old and you're going to move away from there and you don't have to be around them and let them affect you the way that they do even if it is your family telling you negative things I want you to hear me right now saying you are beautiful you are so talented you are so strong and even going through the things that you are with a difficult family is building your character up and it's stretching your heart so that when you leave that family you're going to be able to touch and inspire and love people in a way that you never felt because that's something you wanted and your heart is going to be sensitive to that and you can go out and shine who you want to be how you want to be this little encapsulated time that you're stuck with your family is not forever and in your mind you feel like you're less than you hear me telling you you are amazing and talented incredible gift of unique precious and you are so loud please feel all of the love I'm sitting in my arms when you feel alone you know that you're not alone even if you don't believe in God and you're not religious you can cry out to God and you can ask him to fill you up with love in your heart he is your heavenly father your father in heaven can fill you it with love that your earthly ones can't give you that can be something you can pray and you can feel my heart and my love around you encouraging you so so so so so much number three your hard times are building you an amazing success story no matter what you're going through how hard it is I have been down in the most awful depressed horrible times in my life I felt like my career was over I didn't have any money I hardly had money to even buy food all of these hard times and I was more and more things kept going on and getting worse and worse and worse and I was like I don't even want to say things can get worse because when I do then my car breaks down then something else happens worse then I don't have a car all kinds of days I want you to know that your successor whether it's a loss of a relationship job family member your hope your career anything going on is building your success story that much better if you don't have those hard times you don't have a good success story that's what's going to make your success story your comeback so amazing that's what that is what's gonna make you so happy when you overcome those things and it's going to make you so appreciative to say you know what I have been through hard times and that makes these good times so much more amazing because I've been down when it wasn't great and then when you reach those high moments you're like this is so amazing and you're gonna be so much more thankful in those moments where other people still maybe complain like oh my fancy steak is a norm enough my hotel room isn't big enough you're me like um I have maybe not had a bed or a home to call a home so this is just awesome everybody that's gone on to do amazing things had a horrible beginning they had horrible things along the way that they overcame and that's what made them so much greater stronger incredible resilient tenacious that willing ability to go after things and through things because when you're called the greatness you have to have the ability to handle hard things because they're gonna happen it's not gonna be easy greatness is a lot of roads of the heart and difficult things on the way and you're like oh yeah I went through all kinds of awful things there's no problem I can handle this to number four your biggest most awesome amazing day choice career relationship home everything is waiting for you in your future today may be the worst most crumbly everything feels like it's falling apart an awful day but you have no idea what's waiting ahead for you I remember years ago years and years and years ago and it was a pause in between when I was a makeup artist and before I started YouTube I was in such a depressed state I felt like I had no hope at all nothing for my future I was so depressed it just felt like I was just breathing through days but they didn't mean anything and I I I felt like nothing so so so hopeless and if someone would have told me what was up ahead in my future YouTube and all the amazing things that have happened because of that and you guys being here to love me and encourage me even through hard times like losing my dad I never would have believed that was up ahead in my future and where I was that it was something that I I couldn't save this it if you told me I wouldn't have believed you you know and in that time when I felt so hopeless and I'm sure you guys have been in those places like why am I going on I can't I do not want to wake up and live another day because it's awful know that I've been there and each of those days you need to focus on something on your future do one thing for your future what is it you like there's something that we all like whether it's going to a movies going shopping drawing painting singing there's something that you like to do teaching people there's something that you like to do and each they do something towards that set a goal and do something to get you to that awesome place you need to focus on whatever that is to get there and when you have a direction it gives you a sense of needing to be here and where you're gonna go it's like your anchor you're throwing your anchor out and that's where you want to be it's setting your direction you're putting your map into your GPS if you don't nobody starts out just driving and you just sit in your car like I've got nowhere to go I've got nothing to do I'm just gonna be in my car all day no you have to put in address a location where do you want to be if your direction if your destination is I want to be in New York City I want to be in Los Angeles I'm just saying that cities not like your destination like I want to be a teacher I want to be a singer I want to be a musician whatever it is do one thing a day to get you towards that destination don't just sitting in your car sit in your car feeling like it's meaningless like I've got nothing to do nowhere to go I didn't smell horrible and it's okay cuz I've been in that prison like I don't even wanna wake up I didn't want to go to sleep I feel like this and I'm not saying this was years ago I still feel like this I'm fine guys one of my friends said that he felt very suicidal one time in his life and he told his grandma and his grandma said don't you dare kill yourself before the best day of your life and he said I thought about that in that moment I knew I'm going through something difficult but up ahead and my best day forward in my life if I'm not even able to look back and be like oh my gosh remember that hard time I went through it I made it through that and look right at now don't give up in this hard time you keep going cuz the amazing stuff is up ahead keep going to the amazing stuff and finally number five this part about why to be alive is sometimes it seems crazy because you got to do something and then you got to do nothing so the doing something is do something every day go for a walk go for a run do something to get your blood pumping where you feel good and it feels like your life go out leave your house go out somewhere go on a walk go to a store go something where you see people and you're inspired if you can't go anywhere look at your phone look at pictures from places around the world that you want to see look at street fashion around the world something so you see outside the little bubble of what you're in because that can feel overwhelming and so depressing sometime set goals do something every day that is gonna get you towards something greater whatever that is if it's a sport a hobby anything you like do one thing toward that or about that everyday and then the other part is the do nothing this is where sometimes no matter what the chaos in your world is like how many things are going wrong and feeling crazy you have to sit back and say you know what I'm removing myself from the crazy train I'm gonna get off of it and I'm gonna do nothing I'm gonna go watch a favorite movie oh do something that you love look if you like looking at art or photography or fashion or whatever it is go and do that and just give yourself a break whether it's you just go make a cup of tea and watch your favorite movie do something that makes you laugh you need humor you need laughter watch a funny stand-up thing a funny movie anything to get you laughing and whether you believe in God or you don't I'm not excluding anybody or anything I'm just telling you what helps for me it's just praying and just saying God just take all of my problems these are everything that's hurting me bothering me stressing me out making me feel overwhelmed please just take them and do something with them just help me in this time and I'm gonna sit and trust and know that you're going to help me in the situation if you don't believe in God which I know some of you don't just take a moment and do nothing just take a break from everything that's hard and difficult and you just have to do that sometimes if going online is bothering you and upsetting you seeing things whether it's sad news or awful people treating other people mean or mean comments take a break from it don't go on it give your heart give your mind a break from whatever it is if you can't get a break like if it's your family your household that you live in and they're driving you crazy or a relationship try to create a break if it's leaving and going on a walk and separate those things know that a lot of people grow up with crazy parents and family you're going to be able to get away from them sometime know that you are your own person and you're gonna go off and do things amazingly however you want in your future and even this time this is gonna build your strength don't no matter what you're going through know that I love you I think you're so amazing and no matter what you're going through this is gonna make that future amazing place you're going to be and the success story of how you got there so much more amazing find something joyful that you love to focus on every day and I'm praying that each one of you watches this video and is watching it right now and is sad I want you and I just prayed that you are filled with so much joy joy that is bubbling up and overwhelming in your heart that it pours out to people around you you've got to do something to make a difference and change in this world make the people around you make somebody's day smile at them give them a compliment the more you pour out kindness and love to people around you the more you're gonna feel it bubbling up in your own heart know that I love you so so so so much and if you were in front of me and you ever see me anywhere you better come up and let me hug and squeeze you and just feel my hug in real life and if you can't feel all the love that I'm shoving through this screen to you right now knowing that I love you you can get through this hard time every hard time in my life I felt that I couldn't get through I felt like I couldn't take it and there's been many days in my life where I woke up and I didn't want to be alive I wanted to go back to be asleep so I didn't have to deal with the pain of that day I made it through those days and I'm stronger and you're gonna make it through each and every one of those days find something to laugh about find something you love doing find something to make you make smile and make des find something that area a break in a day where you just feel like ah know that I love you you are alive and here for a purpose my grandma used to say it's not that people want to die they don't want to just be dead it's that they want the pain to stop and whatever pain is going on in your life you tell her right now I'm gonna put a stop on you because I update things on my future you might be trying to hurt me now but I'm gonna focus on some things that aren't hurting me and I'm gonna get through this I'm not gonna be bitter and hardened from this I'm gonna be softer

of crazy things up and down but that's always life but I just want this to encourage you guys that years ago when I was depressed and literally I mean I probably told this so many times like I found my career my life my future everything was over I never could have imagined anything good happening that I would have people that like me or watch me around the world that I would make youtube videos that I would be able to do a makeup collaboration with to face or that I would be on a TV show like I I hope this encourages you guys because I was more depressed than ever more alone than ever but sometimes when you guys are when you're feeling alone or lonely sometimes that is your cocoon moment like caterpillars have to be alone to be in their cocoon to turn into a butterfly so if you're feeling lonely and alone don't worry because this could be your cocoon time that's preparing you for the most beautiful butterfly moment up ahead and I just want that to encourage you guys so much because I was at a very lonely alone time in my life when I started YouTube and I had no idea that it would blossom into this butterfly moment that I've been able to inspire you guys and touch your

drive that's 20 hours there was four hours left to like take a shower and sleep so it's been crazy I thought I'd be able to edit videos out in between all this filming and it does not work out at all and then actually I'm totally not complaining coz this is the most awesome thing in the world I just wanna let you guys know like what my schedule has been how crazy and chaotic it's been um so I filmed the full day of shooting for like twelve or fourteen hours directly from set I left to go fly to Dallas to do the meet and greet there were slight issues I didn't get until 2:00 in the morning then I did the meet-and-greet immediately from the meet-and-greet I flew which was right after lunch I flew directly back to LA which is like I don't know a three hour flight or something and then they sent a van for me to do my hair and makeup so when I landed I left the set from working like a 12 14 hour day went to Dallas do the moon greet then I flew directly back to the set and in the car on the way they did my hair makeup and wardrobe so the second I get I got there we went back to set and then I went back to filming again so this schedule has been I love this job I love what we're

better it may already be sold out I don't know by the time this goes up but okay I just had to get that all the way in case you guys didn't hear about it so let's go on to Hawaii so I'm gonna show you some weird gadgets also later like what the heck is this thing for him why why do I love that but I'll tell you guys about that later and please none of this stuff is sponsored I'm just showing my favorite things that I got okay so these Aloha hats like look at how cool these aloha trucker hat got I bought three like I love them so I got the hot pink one I got this is just like a cool print one and then I got this one which if you see me on my snapchat you've already see me wearing this but these come from that is in the laundry so I can't show you that but it's super cool with like rainbow it says like Aloha spelled out and like cool graphic things so this came from a really cool place called the mill if you go to Hawaii the best food I may have ever eaten in my life they grow everything on the farm there they cook it there it was like mind-blowing the delicious and if you ever go to Maui in your near Wailea go to the monkeypod restaurant just go there get their strawberry pie and thank me later because it's like eating heaven like it's like whipped cheesecake mousse with strawberries on top and then they have a coffee chocolate one if I was there any more days I would have gained like eighty pounds because I could not stop eating them I wanted to go every day was so crazy and then this is from the Maui soap company this is in pikake cent which is one of my mom's favorite you can get this at Maui bath Calm it's vegan paraben free that lye free made on Maui I just want to stick this in my nose and smell it the rest of my life because it smells so stinking good I can't even handle how good it smells and then I got the Maui gardenia again from Maui back oh my gosh I I wish they made these in perfumes I would literally I literally want to take a chunk of this and shove it up my nose and walk around the world and just smell how delicious it smells I got pukaki and gardenia I know pukaki sounds like a weird kapa cocky don't be so cocky okay that's mellow delicious then what else so I finally got this I got the Brazilian bum bum cream I'm so excited because I thought all over Instagram everybody's talking about it this smells pretty amazing and vacation like I would say this wins number one this might win number two now I can smell people when I smell it they have this on I'm you got that Brazilian bum bum crema I'm gonna smell it from here it is amazing then another thing we're not even setting down things okay this is my favorite drugstore buy so this is a Revlon mega multiplier mascara and since I'm a relative after they sent it to me all that stuff but I like fell in love with this mascara the reason why is it cut it doesn't come off until it gets a certain temperature warmth water so I forgot to my waterproof mascara when I went on vacation and I was like ah shoe I didn't bring my waterproof was I thinking I'm gonna be in the water splashing around swimming and you put this on and it does not come off you guys I got like waves are crashing into my face water was splashing my face all the time people were splashing water in my face little kids in the pool and stuff and it did not did not come off at all and it didn't make my eyelashes hard like waterproof mascara like makes your eyelashes so hard sometimes they like hurt like your skin I don't know what it is but these and then you just want to use the hot water they just totally come off like these tubes of mascara I like love taking it off at night cuz I'm just like I loved seeing the little tubes come off so I love this guy then this is my new favorite obsession this is the Too Faced chocolate brow knee pencil and I use it in soft brown so you get this flat side see so you get this flat side and then you get a spoolie side and let me tell you guys I have a pet peeve those mascara the eyebrow pencils they're shaped like a teardrop like it's like like I'm trying to draw like a teardrop it's like new and then it comes up in a point like like a teardrop like it looks like a Beauty Blender but it comes out of the tube this shape I can't stand those or the triangle ones and you can't get I can't get my brow to look right maybe other people can't I don't like those but this shape is flat so it draws a perfect flat line across the top flat line they're flat line up flat line here flat line there and then you just fill it in with a wide flat part I do the fastest brows with this I loved the Anastacio dip brow forever and I would try other things but I would go back to it and never like something better I have not stopped using this since I got the chocolate brownie to face one in the soft round I love that stuff uh my other favorite well it's me on the favorite so I tried this this is the milk makeup concealer oh boy this is kind of amazing let me tell you why they use the technology from band-aids like band-aid liquid band-aid technology so it like becomes a paint layer on your skin so it doesn't come off it doesn't crinkle it doesn't bunch up it doesn't separate because you're literally like painting your skin with it and it becomes like one with your skin like you've spray-painted your flesh discolor it doesn't crack well it doesn't come off the coverage is amazing they call it flex concealer because it flex with all the lines I put it like as a primer on my lips because I don't know it like bends with your lips it doesn't crackle I put it under here this stuff is just amazing I love it Selma's promo if you guys didn't know this is my candy banana pudding the blurring and perfecting and brightening powder this is literally like a Photoshop filter for your face it's got multiple colors and pigments in it so they break up and diffuse light so when light hits your face anywhere light from the Sun like from a wouldn't light ball whatever it diffuses and breaks up the color so it reflects like a blurred technology of perfection I've already put it on but it brightens the whole eye area it lifts it it banishes under-eye circles gets rid of the red because there's like all there's purple lavender green yellow all these pigments it just brightens up your whole face and acts like a filter I am obsessed with this stuff has shameless plug glow around it this is my whole entire eye shadow palette this is my whole entire lip collection which I love I've also got where is it my candy glow highlighter on my cheekbones can you see that I got that right here and also my candy liner black liquid liner from my Too Faced collection I put my blood sweat tears heart so much in this a link down the video to me announcing it but I love the stuff okay okay now we're going back to other things I think I've talked about this the Sarah filled dense effects hair thickener from Redken I've talked about this several times but I know anybody who has thin hair and wants to make their hair look I mean I forget this thing says it makes your hair look like 900 times thicker this stuff is amazing I put this in every day because I have like hair that's so thin you it's just like sad but this is the Sarah fill maximize dense effects from Redken and you have to get it like a salon but I just find us along to go get it axe is amazing another thing this is the glam glow dream duo I ran out of my favorite nighttime moisturizer and it's not sold in Sephora stuff and like I keep reading order it and get more but I'll talk more about that later but until then I've been using the glam glow dream duo so one side you get this serum you put that all over your face for 30 seconds and you let it set in and then you put the gray color on top and it just feels like you're drenching your face in like this hydration glowy beautifulness for all night long so I love that and I put it like on my neck I put it everywhere everywhere I love it now I'm gonna get onto a book I know we're talking about books I like Oprah's Book Club this book is called how successful people think it's a little short it's just like small little boogie things if you want to change the way you think about life to be successful in anything life career dreams goals anything you do this book is amazing by John C Maxwell how successful people think I'm reading that right now and I love it I'm not done with it but I do love it now this is our last but not least thing I think what in the heck is this this is a sleep monitor this is from ResMed so I went and I spoke at this thing called world and there was a sleep doctor there I have a really hard time sleeping I don't sleep enough it's caused health issues like many things have gone on so they had a sleep doctor that was called the sleep doctor he trains rock stars athletes celebrities all these people people to travel to globe how to not have jetlag how to sleep get the best sleep ever it was fascinating like I've never been so I was just taking pages of notes in his workshop so he gave out with if you went to his workshop you got one of these sleep monitors so it's from ResMed I don't really know how much they are because you literally just got a sleep monitor when you went to the workshop but I also got his book called the I think it's called the power of when but it's based it it breaks down your personality type you take a test and then it tells you your best time to do everything your best time to be creative your best time to work out your best time to talk to people your best time to go to bed your best time to wake up everything it is like down to like your best time to eat snacks when you should have breakfast everything based on your personality type like what will work best with you so I'm obsessed with the book you would have thought I won the lottery when I hooked this up I was like so I've been using this for like a week now except for when I went on vacation I didn't bring it with me but so what you do is you set this up at night this sensors you are breathing and it senses your sleep so it can tell when you go to sleep when you go to REM sleep there's an app and it helps you go to sleep like with this sound that's amazing and it synchronizes with your breathing and then it gets your breathing to slow down because you synchronize the breathing with it you guys this is crazy so at the end of the night you do ago hope you enter all your settings and in the morning I'm like it's the most exciting thing in the morning it's the first thing I go and I check out as soon as I wake up I grab my phone and I check my sleep history so it shows you a breakdown you guys want to see this is kind of embarrassing

hello everyone and welcome to my video today or I thought it would be fun to start off with no makeup and in my pajamas and my hair not done and show you the after because I'm not afraid to be on the YouTube internet without any makeup on you see that every day in my snapchat but first let me welcome you to hello and welcome to makeup masterpiece theater I am your host teacher and friend candy Johnson and today I should be teaching you how to apply magnetic eyelashes like a pro but first let me show you the power of makeup and I shall return in three two one hello everybody and today I'm going to show you how to apply magnetic eyelashes like a pro I'm going to show you two different styles of magnetic eyelashes being applied also I'm going to show you some tips and tricks I learned because magnetic eyelashes can be a little tricky but first you may be asking why in the world would anybody where magnetic eyelashes let me tell you these babies are much easier because there's no glue that's stuck on your Island there's no glue to put around they can be put on so fast you just literally just like click them on and they're on you're right easy peasy also some people have allergies to not only latex in eyelash glue but there's also allergies to chemicals in latex free eyelash glue some people have different medical disorders where they're not able to put glues or things like that near the eye or skin so voila we have magnetic eyelashes for ease of use and for people who have allergies to the latex glue these are so easy they're less damaging to your actual eyelash then putting the glue on taking mocks and Natalie use some lashes who wants loose eyelash nobody so um also I did a review of just I bought a bunch of different magnetic eyelashes and then I tested them all out I'm gonna put a link for that below because not all eyelashes magnetic eyelashes are made alike which I lore learned these guys these guys these guys were terrible I'm gonna show you all the ones that were terrible I'm gonna show you the ones that one best eyelashes oh all which they did end up being these one-two lashes and then afterwards when I made the video one two lashes reached out to me and I was like oh my gosh yes I would love these so they sponsored the video they sent me all these eyelashes but I already had agreed these were number one and then they reached out to me so I'm just telling you these guys legitimately were the best eyelashes around and then they just happened to reach out and I was like oh my god you and earlier the best eyelash as I tried so they sent these to me and I'm gonna use these to show you how to apply apply them and then I can profession out okay so they make a bunch of different pairs I'm going to show you my favorite so these are my favorite the bold so these bold lashes you get you get all these sets you get four of these bottom lashes for the top lashes they go magnetized on their little tray this was very different from the cheapo ones I bought they did not come and this is what's gonna preserve them so these guys are a little bit more pricey these are on like the $59 price range if there's any kind of discount codes or anything going on I'll put that link down below but also these guys last you a very long time these were designed they have a patent pending on these magnetic latch systems so everybody else is gonna copy these the magnets were off and all askew and poking in your eye these are not like that these are the best and I have been wearing these so I will wear these a full day from morning until way late at night a lot of hours they don't move they don't come off and then at night I simply slide them apart it's the easiest best thing ever so I'm going to show you these I'm also gonna show you they make if you like the full sets I particularly am NOT a fan of full set lashes glue on or any of these kind I just like the demi whispies which is the whole set but I'm going to show you putting on these and then they also make a more thinner lash like this so if you like a full strip lash then these would be those would be your jam I just happen to like these little demi whispies I just like to pop them on the outer corner because they look more realistic so if you want not realistic looking lashes then you use the full strip which I'm going to show you both of those too so let's show you the professional way cuz I've learned a little bit of tips and tricks as I've been wearing these for a little while now so I'm going to show you the basic way with just the tweezer and then I'm going to show you with the one to Cosmetics official athlete kata so first all you do is you get the one that matches so this is top left so you take your top left first step you need to curl your lashes so you want to make sure you have the whole lash curl give it a good countdown from 10 to 0 do the same thing on this side you want to make sure that you curl the lashes before you put your mascara on because once you have the curled lashes on you don't want your curl the false ones going up and then your regular well they're sticking straight down so you always want to Croatia's no matter what you're putting magnetic or your lashes then you want to put two to three coats of your regular mascara that's them on the bottom guys because they don't have false lashes for the bottom so we had to give them a little loose teeth and if anybody wants to know I'm using the Too Faced better than sex mascara we're gonna let that dry so we're just gonna grab them with our finger like this we're gonna place him right on top of the lashes just like we would if we were just doing our regular lock just push him down if he feels like he's not curved enough you can take the band and you gently can bend him like so so he bends just like you would bend a regular strip lash so you just set him down on top of your actual lashes on the outer corner and then you just push the outside edges just push them up against your skin so the lash is scooted up all the way to your lash line itself and you can see just like this it already looks like I have thicker lashes then we're gonna take the bottom guys I'm taking the bottom guys just with my tweezers like this and I'm gonna open my eye up really wide and I'm gonna push these against felt against my skin so they stay in place and then I'm just gonna scoop him up as close as I can underneath to the lash line close to where the eyelashes are going up underneath so I'm pushing him up against here and then I'm gonna push these guys and you just place him and he just kind of clicks on he's just he's just on there like easy-peasy look at how fast can you see the difference of the two lashes already so easy now I'm going to show you on the other side how to do it with the lash applicator so this comes from 1to Cosmetics they've designed this bad boy so to use the applicator we have glue applicators so the top one we place right there so you can see he's on the top of the little applicator then we take our bottom lash and we just simply put him on the bottom so you can see the two lashes are ready to be sandwich like this on top of our eye so then all we do is we open up you press these guys down and voila eyelashes on if you feel like he's not placed right you simply take the lash and you slide them apart some in a pinch and slide them apart and they easily come off the eye okay so I'm going to show you one more time we place him on the top the band it's gonna go near your eye goes here and then the fluffy part goes in towards the little crease so it should look like this the band is on the outer edge and the fluffy tip point towards this little tiny triangle angle over here we just open up our eye and you press these guys down together voila they're on your eye like this is so easy it's a really fun because it feels kind of like it feels like a magic trick like they just like snip on and you can do whichever way is comfortable if you like the applicator if you like the tweezer if you like just doing it with your fingers on whichever way feels best then what you want to do is you want to press them together with your fingers so that you're really mashing them together and then what you can also do similar to what you do when you put regular eyelashes on is you can go ahead take your regular mascara and wiggle just a little bit to marry the false lash together with the real lash they also sell a lash cleaner so you can clean these so even though they feel like they're a little bit more of an investment because they're pricey these are gonna last so much longer as long as you take care of them you gently remove them carefully and you place them back on the magnetized tray they will stay in shape and last you so long you could use these for months and months and months so again I'm going to show you with the different pairs so this is our final pair of the these are the bold lashes these are my personal favorite lashes they just look beautiful and people are just gonna ask like what mascara are using oh my gosh your lashes look so long they won't be like oh my gosh what lashes are you wearing because I can see you wear false lashes these just look like realistic flare lashes on the end so this is the before with just regular mascara and this is the after with the bold lash so then to remove you simply pinch and you're going to twist you're going to slide your fingers so pinch so pinch and pull apart and easy peasy there right off and then when you've made sure that you've just lived them apart you're not pulling the magnets from the band you're just gently sliding them apart then you just place them right back on their magnetic tray okay so now I'm gonna show you how to put the larger strip lashes on for anybody that well does the strip lash so we're going to first put the top right on and just like I do with any regular lash I do this little you grab each side and you just kind of roll them back and forth to get them a little bit so he'll stick to the shape of our eyelid so I lay him right down on top of the lash and then with my tweezer I'm gonna grab the little bottom anchor guys so he comes at the top and then these little bottom anchor ones are what holds it in place so I'm gonna hold him there I'm gonna push the lash against my eyelid and I'm gonna scoop him underneath as close to the inner eyelid to hold him down open up kind of big and we magnetized him on the outside now I'm gonna adjust this top one make sure he's right where I want him to be this is without the lash and this is with the full magnetic strip lash and while we're at it I'm going to show this extra volume guy so you can see what he looks like on this side again we're gonna give him a rub around like so we're gonna stick him on our lash line now we're gonna get our bottom anchor guys and I'm gonna hold him against the skin he's secure we're gonna make sure he is placed places this laughs right up against this lash line I'm gonna get our next little buddy we're gonna make sure he is placed place this lash right up against this lash line and he's gonna hop right on and so this is more of the fool like a more full dramatic Instagram lash I like the little bold guys that just go on the outer edge they're really really easiest of all these lashes they are the absolute easiest to put on these little guys like this so they're just these little outer wispies which is what I wear normally when I just were like a gluon lash but if you want a lot of drama these definitely are beautiful and the great part about these is they go on really easily they do not destroy your lashes and I love at night like when you wash your eyes off there's no glue residue left on your eyelash or your eye you just take it off and you're done so yesterday I was like I don't want to deal with the glue ouch and I just wore the little bolt guys aren't they're absolutely beautiful so I hope you guys like this let me know if you guys want me to try out more eye lashes again I will put a link down below so you guys can see me trying out different lashes that I spent my money on so you guys don't have to go trying different ones from Amazon or wherever else the magnetic lashes because there were so many terrible ones like I could not even believe somebody actually sold some of these and then these one two cosmetics were the ones that I had heard the most about and they they did cost me more money so when I did order these I'm like I'm gonna buy them and I'm gonna try these and these definitely were hands down the winner so that's the only reason that I use these to do this tutorial and thank you to one to lash for actually reaching out and sending me these I wish they had sent them before I went out and I was like buying all the lashes do but um this goes to show you I got bought so I ordered the first pairs myself online these are amazing and they just sent me these and it was awesome to get to try these and they gave me like some tips on how to put them on and wearing them so I I'm giving you guys the best the most best advice I can and these are

those things I'm gonna tell you guys something that I learned and I don't want I don't want to freak anybody out I did hear this in church if you don't believe in God you're not religious you don't want to hear about religious thing it doesn't even have anything to do with religious stuff this is just cool and I hope it encourages your heart it's just about a prutte tree so um there was a scripture and he talks about this man has a fig tree and he's like I wanted to cut this fig tree down I've had it for three years it hasn't bear to me fruit and his gardeners like no just give it one more year what he didn't know is that fig trees take three to six years to bear their fruit because of the strong the tree has to be strong enough then it can hold the weight of the figs of the fruit it's bearing so if you got this little baby tree and he's like oh I'm not strong enough to hold the weight of the fruit he's too little he's got to get strong and grow bigger that is like our life we have to go grow so strong to bear the blessings of success in the big things that are going to be in our life and sometimes we got to be real strong maybe we got some huge successes in the future that we got to be real strong for see how to be real strong to go through all these hard things to strengthen us you know it's like when you work out it tears your muscle apart and then it hurts like the workout is hard and then it tears your muscle apart and then that hurts but that's how you get stronger that's how you the muscle that's how things in our life are sometimes we go through hard thing

manure that is where the good things grow that's where the nutrients grow were plants grow rich in that manure richer than if they just had regular dirt they need some poop on that dirt and that is

most bubblegum pink color ever this was from j.crew I personally don't ever shop at j.crew because like it I don't know like I never feel like it's not really like my style normally and I went with my

hi guys so I'm making this view I was actually in bed and I got up out of bed to film this video because not that this is a surprise to anybody but life is hard like life is tremendously and ridiculously hard it's not all Instagram photos of somebody online in endless vacation like every time you look at their Instagram they're just traveling to exotic locations and on vacation and doing things or that life is perfect that's as fake as the filters on snapchat is not real this is not real life so if you're looking at that and it's making you feel bad about your life like oh my life isn't like theirs that's not real they're giving you like the illusion of the best of the best of their lives and people don't really tell you what's going on in their lives you know I have friends whether my friends do things online or not online they're not sharing everything that's going on in their lives with the world some people are but most of the people are not and most of the people you see walking around on the streets are not telling you oh my parent just died oh I'm going through a divorce or a breakup or I lost my job or I'm dealing with these things that I don't even know how I'm going to handle life is just hard and it feels overwhelming many times in your life no matter what you're going through I've gone through some things that I felt like I wasn't going to make it through and a lot of people have gone through so much more than even that that I thought I couldn't make it through you know when I lost my dad there's somebody said oh I lost my mom and my dad in a car accident in one day you know like there's so many things that are horrible that are going on in people's life no matter what you're dealing with there's so much pain in the hurt and I want you to know that you guys can make it through this thing and it's something that you have to decide in your head your mind your heart everything all in one because there's times when I see things I turn on the news and my heart can't handle seeing the things I can't handle seeing a parent killing their child or seeing an accident of all these awful horrific things happening I can't my heart like can't I can't deal with it I can't hear about any more babies being left in cars in the heat cuz a pair forgot them like all these things I can handle knowing these things happen like it just hurts my heart too much but it's someone I have to but make sure I tell myself but you can get through this life don't say that you're too sensitive for this world because you have to live in this world you have to go through it don't say I can't deal with another thing going wrong because I guarantee when you say that five more things are gonna go wrong you have to say I am strong and in those moments you have to say I'm unstoppable I am so strong I'm gonna get through this no matter what it is the second you say I can't get through this this is too much this is too overwhelming you are sinking in a hole that is gonna just go down right and you're never going to get out of it no matter what you're facing right now today no matter what you're sitting there what is hurting in your heart whether it's a family member that you lost a break up a relationship thing maybe you've lost your job maybe you're facing something that you don't even see a way out of no matter if you don't even see a way it's gonna get better or anything you have to stop in that moment and say I am unstoppable you stop right now in this video I'm going to pause and I want you to tell yourself even if you want to stand out value say it in your mind save right now I'm unstoppable say in your mind I know one of you didn't do it that's watching this and I want you to say it right now say I am unstoppable no matter what is coming at me no matter what I'm facing I'm gonna get through it you're gonna be that person marching through the ocean the waves could be crashing against you you're still going to keep walking whether you're dragging weights behind you or whatever it is you are going to be unstoppable no matter what somebody else that you love you're worried about your concern about they're dealing with you can tell them the same thing say you are unstoppable and you're gonna get this if you want to share this video with them I don't care that I don't make a bottle care that filled in last night if this touches somebody's heart because I was sitting in bed and I was like so upset thinking of something of people that I know and I see on Twitter or that I know and realized the things that they're going

the past and I want you guys to decide right now no matter what's going to happen in your future say I'm going to get through it it's just gonna be one more bump in the road one more thing that's

I seriously put this thing away before I hurt myself hi guys it's candy and as you can see I don't have any liner or mascara on this eye because I'm going to show you guys how to master the basic winged eyeliner like a pro if you haven't subscribed to me do it right now like this video if you want to see more makeup basics like a pro this isn't crazy complicated just super easy because this even scares the most famous celebrity makeup artists that are my friends if somebody's not telling you they're still a little scared to a winged eyeliner sometimes they're not being real with you so I'm going to show you guys how to master it I've seen so many tips from using a spoon to taping your face - pretty sure I hope they were joking with a knife but I'm gonna show you guys how just to do doing liner window game is no gadgets no weapon no knives no tape no utensils nothing I'm gonna show you how to do it and you're like comment below what other makeup base if you would like to master like a pro let's get started here we go all you want to do first is make sure that you put in eye primer or I just like to use concealer then you want to set that with powder then you want to go ahead and do your regular eye shadow like normal you need the eyelid to be dry with a powder or an eye shadow if you don't it's just going to melt off and smear the pigment in the liquid eyeliner they can't adhere if there's oil on the lid it needs to be dried with the eyeshadow or at least powder on your face so let's go to the bathroom and I will show you how to do this okay so the first thing that I need to tell you is you want to use a felt tip eyeliner this is my favorite right now it's the TARDIS from Tarte you can use any felt tip eyeliner that you want the trick is that you want a felt tip liner that's very pointed and firm the brushes can get really wobbly and sometimes gel liner is a little trickier to master there are great drugstore options too so anything that looks like this go ahead and give it a try okay a very important tip is when you go to do this you don't want to just come with this handle floaty around all crazy that's going to give you wiggly lines for sure you need to have like a fulcrum point or somewhere where this is still against your face and then this is going to move in this direction so for me this is this is how I would put it on so I put like this this hand near my chin or resting on my chin or however and then this hand is against there to hold it still it's not touching my face so it can move if you do this on your face you're limiting your movement and it's going to be really weird so I do it here and then this guy like I'm rest like I'm doing this and then I put him on top to hold him steady and then same thing when you do your wing just move him up your jaw line or wherever hold this steady and then lean your hand on here so you have like a range of movement if you do it here you can't get you can't get good angles this way so you want to hold your hand here and then you do that on top that's what's going to give you this whole new skill otherwise this floating this is going to give you Wiggly right there and also if you're working on a client what you want to do is this is different when you're on a client you can do different angles and be close it's the same as like a hairdresser can blow-dry your hair different than you can you just need different angles so you want to put one of those powder puffs on your hand slip your fingers in it so it's not against their face and then you you do your angles this way when you're on their face it's different than when it's on your own face the angle is totally different so quiet you can do here with the powder puff like this you you're going to do cutesy posing from a picture and then you're going to do your wing liner like so okay so I like to take the tip of my brush and I lay him down sideways I'm not going in on the tip and drawing like this I'm laying it flat up against my skin so I lay him down here right at the midpoint of the eye and you want to make sure that you're looking straight on if you're doing it down or too far back your line and wing is going to get really weird-looking so I lay him down flat right there and then I just go to the outer corner go down like this and then you really want to make sure that you fill in the lashline if there's any gaps where you see your skin that gets weird smooth out this line and a little back against the lash line then again I'm going to lay him down I'm just going to lay it right down and I kind of pushing it down onto like my lashes and you're like stamping that down and then connecting it and then you want to go to the inner corner and I'm just going to lay it down even more I'm not drawing with the tip I'm using the whole side of the brush just pushing it against my skin so you push and then go in the direction but you're pushing it against and drag not just with the tip but the whole side of the felt then you want to go in the inner corner of the lash line so for this part I pull the eye to the side and then you really want to get down almost like you're going towards the inner waterline inside there so you get like a really nice transition and then you can just smooth out any wobbles then when I assumed out the wobbles that's when I go back in with just the tip and I really work on the edge of smoothing out any wobbles so once you get this amid the main part is just getting it from here to here and you can make this as thick as you want over here once you have your wing established then you can decide how thick you want it but this is the basic shape and you want to stop right about the corner where your eyelashes stop the corner of your eye if you go down too far then your wings gonna come down real low and be weird so just stop right at like the corner the skin where that like is the corner of your outer eye right there okay now we're going to do the outer wing part so where you see here on the under curve of your eye this is where you typically want your wing to continue up so just remind imagine if there was a line here and this just curving upward if it if this just kept curving upward like this that's where you want your wing if you like your wing up higher anywhere else you can adjust it but that's typically where you want your wing liner to continue so you just kind of have to eyeball and guess it so I start here down at the end where I stopped my liner and then I'm just going to go up and just little light strokes and I don't do the full wing I just do little light strokes like I'm going up in that direction then I reverse where the direction I'm going and then I connect him where I stop that point and I connect him down here to the top and then just go back and smooth him out if there's a wall anywhere just keep smoothing it out and connecting it and are going to fill this in a little more I'm going to make him a little more pointed so I drag him back this way so I get this point really nice and then under here is all wobbly so I got to go ahead and fix him now this is going to be your special trick you take an angled brush and any matte black eyeshadow and since I don't like having shiny black liner or any wobbly lines you take the black eyeshadow and you go right over where you did your winged liner can you go right on the part on the edge where your skin and the eyeliner met and you just gently blur any wobbly lines or any Wiggles that you may have had and it makes your eyeliner matte and it helps kind of hide any little wiggling guide you may have gotten so it's not so scary you guys can totally do it if you mess up what you want to do is take a little bit I make a room for on a q-tip gently fix or wipe off the smudge put a little bit more concealer powder your eyeshadow so it looks like nothing ever happened and start over again it's just makeup just eyeliner if you don't get it just wipe it off I'm going to go ahead and um put my mascara on so we're gonna curl my lashes um in high school is when I started wearing a liquid eyeliner and it was like Wiggly and wobbly like a lot of the times or they'd be like my wings would be like doing like a wave they were just like not symmetrical at all but just keep practicing and that's how you get better and better and better let me put this on and I'll come right back so you can see the finished result so that was it guys piece of cake now you can be a winged liner master just practice if you mess up just wipe it off and start all over again so make sure you guys subscribe comment below whatever whatever well of a makeup base that you want to see um below so I know what to make for you guys but the winged liner once you master this you can smoke it out smudge it out you can do all kinds of things but a winged liner in a red lip classic lip Marilyn Monroe from the 50s up until now it's still a classic look now you can do we're to

tweeting things out and then I'm like oh they're getting to my emails I got into my Apple ID pretty much everything I have online they got into and I had no access and we get back they hack right back in there were like some super ultra hacker or something from like other countries and I was crazy so that happens to me after the mean a common mom just tell like all of meeting me was awesome and then all my accounts got hacked into but then my mom tell me that we got she's got some bad news from my about my grandpa my grandpa who had lung disease we thought lung cancer we thought it was gone the lung cancer is back it's bigger and it's spread in his body and it's really not good so instantly I don't even care about the hacking I'm just in my sweet little cowboy sweetheart grandpa you know this is just just heartbreaking news you know I love my grandpa so much and he's like he's like my only father figure I have left because my dad isn't hip and you know so I'm like aw man this day love what you know so then we're dealing with that but hacking keeps going on for days I can't get into anything I have it was really frustrating but then bigger things are going on so more stuffs happening all the week so then this is like a funny thing in the mill week so I go to get my nails done still don't have YouTube accounts and all that stuff some I had back so I'm not so I go to get my nails done I wasn't sitting there my nails rose like oh did you park next to the dumbster and I'm like yeah apparently I parked next to the wrong dumpster because my car got towed and then when they got towed the guys like oh yeah our Lots closing you can't there's no time for you to come and pick it up this is like an hour away from my house so then the next day I don't know car figuring out how I'm gonna get back to the place it's an hour way than was an hour way from the doctors because there was like stomach flu that went around the house and a cold so then I'm trying not to throw

guys all all those details of things so sometimes you're glad you like and it was with those things I was like oh my gosh this week feels impossible like I can't I just feel like I'm trying to do things that I can't and I'm slipping far behind in life and everything I have to be doing and it's in those moments where you feel so stinking frustrated you're just like oh life is so hard it's so hard sometimes and other people are dealing with things that are so much harder than this you know um and in those moments this is what I know like I said you're going through life in yours but yeah we're in gear see cool foresee everything's fine but then sometimes you got to open up your oh no I got a room a be game cuz they a little harder then you got to step it up even more and this is my superhero level like I'm putting the cape on and I'm gonna fly and save some problems in my life that's your a game that you're like oh I gotta bring it now you got to snap into your a-game in those moments and be like oh shoot I've got to really put some muscle into this and this is how life has to be any time you're going through anything hard I always learned never say like what else can go wrong because I'm not kidding you you're gonna get a flat tire something else is gonna go wrong like it just it just feels like that you have to say no I'm gonna be stronger and I'm gonna get through whatever else goes wrong whatever else it is it's happening and I know that seems hard but those are things that you have to learn in those moments you're like book I mean they're gonna cry in the corner or I'm gonna be strong and I'm gonna figure out how to do it sometimes you gotta go cry in a corner for a minute before you can go be strong whatever your sequence is you just have to deal with those things I'm gonna tell you guys something that I learned and I don't want I don't want to freak anybody out I did hear this in church if you don't believe in God you're not religious you don't want to hear about religious thing it doesn't even have anything to do with religious stuff this is just cool and I hope it encourages your heart it's just about a prutte tree so um there was a scripture and he talks about this man has a fig tree and he's like I wanted to cut this fig tree down I've had it for three years it hasn't bear to me fruit and his gardeners like no just give it one more year what he didn't know is that fig trees take three to six years to bear their fruit because of the strong the tree has to be strong enough then it can hold the weight of the figs of the fruit it's bearing so if you got this little baby tree and he's like oh I'm not strong enough to hold the weight of the fruit he's too little he's got to get strong and grow bigger that is like our life we have to go grow so strong to bear the blessings of success in the big things that are going to be in our life and sometimes we got to be real strong maybe we got some huge successes in the future that we got to be real strong for see how to be real strong to go through all these hard things to strengthen us you know it's like when you work out it tears your muscle apart and then it hurts like the workout is hard and then it tears your muscle apart and then that hurts but that's how you get stronger that's how you the muscle that's how things in our life are sometimes we go through hard thing they tear us apart but we build up back stronger everybody that I look up to that is an inspiration a success it's all because they've overcome hard things they've overcome heart obstacles in life and they are stronger now and they have more understanding and bigger hearts and so you're so excited when they get great success in their life because you know the hard things that they've been through and no matter what I've been through in my life my mom has always told me no matter what hard difficult thing it was she said this is making your success story that much stronger I want you guys to know that if you're going through a hard time know that this is making your success story that much stronger if it's sickness if it's financial problems with relationship of it's heartache of it's family whatever it is this is making your success story that much stronger in there's those times in our life when it feels like oh man I just got pooped on I just got served a big platter of poop of manure that is where the good things grow that's where the nutrients grow were plants grow rich in that manure richer than if they just had regular dirt they need some poop on that dirt and that is like our lives too sometimes when the garbage of life fills up that seems like oh you got some good stuff ahead you got some good stuff growing in your life your tree is gonna go so strong so huge and

hi guys so I'm making this view I was actually in bed and I got up out of bed to film this video because not that this is a surprise to anybody but life is hard like life is tremendously and ridiculously hard it's not all Instagram photos of somebody online in endless vacation like every time you look at their Instagram they're just traveling to exotic locations and on vacation and doing things or that life is perfect that's as fake as the filters on snapchat is not real this is not real life so if you're looking at that and it's making you feel bad about your life like oh my life isn't like theirs that's not real they're giving you like the illusion of the best of the best of their lives and people don't really tell you what's going on in their lives you know I have friends whether my friends do things online or not online they're not sharing everything that's going on in their lives with the world some people are but most of the people are not and most of the people you see walking around on the streets are not telling you oh my parent just died oh I'm going through a divorce or a breakup or I lost my job or I'm dealing with these things that I don't even know how I'm going to handle life is just hard and it feels overwhelming many times in your life no matter what you're going through I've gone through some things that I felt like I wasn't going to make it through and a lot of people have gone through so much more than even that that I thought I couldn't make it through you know when I lost my dad there's somebody said oh I lost my mom and my dad in a car accident in one day you know like there's so many things that are horrible that are going on in people's life no matter what you're dealing with there's so much pain in the hurt and I want you to know that you guys can make it through this thing and it's something that you have to decide in your head your mind your heart everything all in one because there's times when I see things I turn on the news and my heart can't handle seeing the things I can't handle seeing a parent killing their child or seeing an accident of all these awful horrific things happening I can't my heart like can't I can't deal with it I can't hear about any more babies being left in cars in the heat cuz a pair forgot them like all these things I can handle knowing these things happen like it just hurts my heart too much but it's someone I have to but make sure I tell myself but you can get through this life don't say that you're too sensitive for this world because you have to live in this world you have to go through it don't say I can't deal with another thing going wrong because I guarantee when you say that five more things are gonna go wrong you have to say I am strong and in those moments you have to say I'm unstoppable I am so strong I'm gonna get through this no matter what it is the second you say I can't get through this this is too much this is too overwhelming you are sinking in a hole that is gonna just go down right and you're never going to get out of it no matter what you're facing right now today no matter what you're sitting there what is hurting in your heart whether it's a family member that you lost a break up a relationship thing maybe you've lost your job maybe you're facing something that you don't even see a way out of no matter if you don't even see a way it's gonna get better or anything you have to stop in that moment and say I am unstoppable you stop right now in this video I'm going to pause and I want you to tell yourself even if you want to stand out value say it in your mind save right now I'm unstoppable say in your mind I know one of you didn't do it that's watching this and I want you to say it right now say I am unstoppable no matter what is coming at me no matter what I'm facing I'm gonna get through it you're gonna be that person marching through the ocean the waves could be crashing against you you're still going to keep walking whether you're dragging weights behind you or whatever it is you are going to be unstoppable no matter what somebody else that you love you're worried about your concern about they're dealing with you can tell them the same thing say you are unstoppable and you're gonna get this if you want to share this video with them I don't care that I don't make a bottle care that filled in last night if this touches somebody's heart because I was sitting in bed and I was like so upset thinking of something of people that I know and I see on Twitter or that I know and realized the things that they're going through it just like infuriates me like I want in that life is so hard the things that I've been through each one of you was dealing with something that's hard and if you're not right now we have in the past and I want you guys to decide right now no matter what's going to happen in your future say I'm going to get through it it's just gonna be one more bump in the road one more thing that's going to get to your success it's going to make you stronger you can't get to the mountaintop without having a struggle of getting up there nobody has a great success story unless they've been through hard times every hard thing you go through is gonna make your success story that much better as long as you don't stop and you keep going I am uh I'm like so angry right now the thing that I know

I mean to brag or anything but I do got me some new booty candy cane sunglasses okay so this is my very first and maybe only walk miss for this you remember to tell you guys why it's been so crazy why haven't able to do vlogmas some crazy and exciting things and well one crazy thing today is we are on our way to the urgent care and now I am in some pretty I mean pretty bad back pain from my kidney that I believe someone to the doctor like a year ago or something and they said my kidneys stuff goes wrong with my kidneys and stuff and I just been so busy I haven't like followed up or anything and but this is too many times have I gotten to the emergency room with this so we're going again then I think I need to go to the doctor like for reals I don't know what's going on but that's what we're doing right now I'm trying to pretend like nothing when my back is hurting and then the other exciting part is that we this will be our last Christmas in our house so all of the the Christmas stories that you guys see in the past this is going to be our last in here and since we're gonna be moving next month I didn't do like all the decorations I normally do cuz I knew we were gonna be moving so I will show you guys interior that okay so we left the urgent care and it seems that my kidneys aren't acting normal so she said I have to go see a specialist but she gave me some stuff that should help help for right now I think though we're gonna go into Whole Foods and get some snack Alief food [Music] we found a double rainbow maker [Music] okay so I didn't feel very much because I wasn't feeling very good so I've got my heating pad on my back I am all cozy up and so look at my big sock reveal are you ready I didn't even have matching socks but I'm gonna try to film some more for you guys tomorrow it's probably like the most boring along this other people are probably doing really exciting things my my god what were your urgent care grocery shopping just laying in my house so I still find this interesting but I am going to watch some Hulu I just got Hulu I feel like I just got addicted to it because it's so cool so like if I travel and I want to watch a show you can watch it on the airport if you have Wi-Fi you could watch it in the car you can watch it in your hotel room you could watch it anywhere you go all of the shows and I did not get to see The Voice I've been so busy I didn't get to see and I love Gwen Stefani and I wanted to see all the episodes with her on it and all her cuteness so now I can watch The Voice on Hulu cuz I love her and it's like is so much better than TV like the no commercials this is I will gladly pay for no commercials if you guys have who like let me know some other shows that I should watch I just get stuck watching the one thing let's see what else we could choose from oh my gosh and even though you can watch you can watch Nickelodeon chose the CW MTV Bravo what e effects eh what this is so stink wait lifetime oh my gosh you guys

love the Brady Bunch oh I did watch Brooklyn nine-nine the other day and the Mindy project everybody said that is really funny everyone watch Seinfeld I have been telling everybody how much I love Hulu and telling everybody to sign up for the free trial then you get hooked on Hulu and next thing you know you sound like a commercial cuz you're telling everybody else how much you love Hulu also I'm gonna go pick a show and just rest cuz I don't know that prescription they gave me is it's like I feel weirder and worse symptoms after I took that the prescription the doctor gave me I don't think I like that stuff but I'm just gonna rest cuz I feel like today wasn't a very exciting day I can't promise to rather than be exciting but at least you'll see what I'm doing so good night guys

Amazon and at Big Lots and some other stores too and these are three more colors not in those displays peaches and cream cherry on top and licorice so you can use any nail out as you want or you can use the ones that you go by collection to but let's get started [Music] [Music] and these are just your average sneakers nothing too fancy or customized about them but wait until we get out our washi tape and we line the edge of the sneaker you want to rub it down with your fingernail so it's really rub tightly against the rubber and it actually is cool just like that just with some washi tape on your shoes and you're done just kidding then we're going to take this color in cherry on top falls over almost in FULFILLER collection I'm going to be promoting that the whole time because I'm so excited then you're going to paint the Polish all over the rubber of the shoe let me tell you you would not believe I think rubber is the most satisfying thing to paint nail polish on to try it it's amazing and you want to cover the entire area in our red polish peel it off peel it off this is the best all I can watch this again and again I love peeling tape off painted things Wow then while the one side of that shoe is drying we're going to go over to our that she wash she came in love which he still looks pretty cool just like that get more of our cherry on top red and you're just going to paint the other side exactly like we just did on the issue and then it's time to be the peeling you got that love and feeling oh I know that feeling then you want to let it dry on a plate so that you don't get the red on anything you would set the shoe down on ah what is that give it off of there get it off no no no you're just going to take a little bit of acetone free nail polish remover and a q-tip and voila magically erase it and look at the coolest most customized shoes you've ever seen this is just a boring old pink bag that I've had that I've never really used but it's been in my closet for a really long time so I put some paper towels down on my counter to protect it and then place mine on exciting bag on top of the paper towel I then took this color from central colors and my collection with them in mermaid tail because I'm obsessed with this color and this is the fun part are you ready you just take the bottle and you literally pour the polish all over the bag how relaxing satisfying and is this to watch oh we're going to do this in a replay because this is amazing I also realized that this bubble wrap that I reuse from a package I was sent was much better than just a paper towel on my counter no camera hurt in the filming of this video and tada the finish and dried bag I love it and it looks like a work of art probably have some old or cheap rhinestone jewelry laying around somewhere that is just waiting to be made over you simply stick your earring post into some foam I'm taking the sinful colors from my collaboration also in mint chip it is my favorite cut one of my favorite colors in the whole entire world and you begin to paint every stone this is a dry intern mat you're going to use two to three coats of this and you want to let each coat dry for about 30 minutes in between and these things came out so cool I actually wore them to the day I was going to hang out with Glenn Stefani and you know how much I loved her so you know how important they had to be don't just let the top of your shoes have all the fun I'm going to show you a high note pop of color for the bottom just like how Lou Bhutan started with red nail polish on the bottom you can paint yours any color though but I love red and turquoise together I'm using the matte cherry on top from my collection because why would I use any other red because I made some designs this one myself you're going to paint it very carefully I did not use tape because I just thought maybe and that did it except for that blob right there but you could just wipe it off and hey I'm back to being a professional perfect professional shoe painter you want to paint all the bottom everywhere the very bottom the heel you can do this with any shoe actually that you wanted but I just thought these high heels like yeah pour that look at that that is so fun just poured everywhere move it out paint the edges very carefully like so then you want to take your shoe and you want to put it inside of a cardboard box you want to wedge the heel into the corner so it can tip side aside and let it dry and turn into this beautiful shoe now we've got some can DIY get at candy candy DIY lace earrings so I took this old skirt that I was gonna be getting rid of and I thought hey I can do something with it so I cut out a little floor out of the lace if you tiny little scissor that's a little too big so I want to trim it down a little smaller so it's not covering our whole entire ear and once I haven't cut to the desired and chute shape for an earring I knew we had to get some clear nail polish and paint two to three coats to get it hardened this will protect it and give it a stiff finish to as much dirtier than just so obvious when we kind of Lee I then got the installing silver earring hooks at Michael's opened him up with my little baby pliers and hooked him through the top center of the lake clothes of pliers chef and voila you have a shoe and adorable pair of fun little lace earrings you made yourself they look artsy craftsy bohemian and super cool and if you happen to have any LG's hair earrings like these lying around you simply push them into your phone then you're going to take your white nail polish I'm going to be using my polish in zip frosting and paint one to do so onto the earring then once that is ride takes spoonful of sugar and olive sparkling glory let it dry in between coats and two to three coats later look what they'll look like sparkling and beautiful and mesmerizing and like I want my wall to look like them too [Music] [Music] and

this in New York at the YouTube space it's so cool so this would be like if the capital had its own TV station this is like their TV station for style and fashion so I got to turn into tigress which is one of the characters and I'll show you guys the makeup artist came up with this look that looks like a drawing in a sketch and then I am going to turn myself into this tigress character look looks like a drawing so that's why the lines don't look perfect it looks kind of sketchy like an actual drawing with look and then now may I present you with my capital Couture look this was so cool and at the end I will tell you a couple funny things and stories about this look and what happened doing the shoot and afterwards so without further ado may I present capital couture here we go hello citizens its candy here welcoming you to another episode of inside capital couture high-fashion supreme authority today we're going to create a look that's inspired by a former style superstar turned fashion fatality its tigress The Hunger Games stylist who pushed the very concept of beauty to a wild new place whatever you may think of her there's no denying her creative courage and profound effect on capital fashion I mean talk about a dramatic look me yeah her transformation was total today we're not going quite as far as she did but I'm going to show you a look that captures her fabulous feline spirit first I'm gonna change my eye color then I'm going to conceal my eyebrows with a glue stick next I'm going to apply the white color base all over my face now I'm going to be adding all the color to the edges the Blues the lavenders and the purples after that I'm going to go in with a black cream color and create the tiger pattern next to add emphasis I'm going to go in with a black liquid liner and really detail the edges and the fine line work then put these crazy lashes to really add into our cat eye next I'm going to take a black liquid color and do the detail work of the nose I'm adding a gold cream color to the inside of the black tiger pattern and the last step with the black liquid liner to get the little whisker dots around her mouth there are so many body mods these days from skin coloring to luminescent tattoos you can credit stylists like tigress for that she really inspired people to push the limits for final touches I'm adding gold stripes onto the lower part of the lip and here we are a dramatic look inspired by that leonine legend tigress thanks for watching citizens stay tuned for more hot looks and uncanny ideas and remember fashion is forever and loyalty never goes out of style see you next time on inside capital couture okay so that was the video that was so awesome to do to get to be able to be a part of that Hunger Games series so a couple funny stories about that shoot the first one is for the contacts I want it to be where I close my eyes I open them and I have a new eye color well one of the production assistants have been soaking the contacts not in contact solution but in contact cleaning solution which burns your eyeball terribly you're not supposed to put that air eye so I put the contact in immediately my eye hurts so bad it feels like it's on fire and I normally can't get the contacts out very well with these nails I grab that thing out of my eyes so fast but my eye was bright red so we didn't get to do the scene where like I blink open and it's a new contact because my I was right rest in the beginning of the video you can see my eye is still so so so so red my I think it was this eye I can't remember and then the next one is I was supposed to fly out to New York so out of New York leaving there it was filmed at the YouTube space there so they were like you got to get on your flight candy and like every they were telling me how long I had to finish the video so one point they're like you have 15 minutes to finish and I had only done like not even the full side of the other half of the face so I was trying to hurry as fast as I could and then finally they're like you're probably just gonna miss your flight but let's see if you can get though you don't have time to wash your makeup off or get the contacts out I looked like the finished look like a tiger and I was like I'm going to just have to go to the airport like this knows like I cannot go to the airport like this I will scare little children that will see me there so I miss my flight oh I got on a much later flight but I had to wash my face off and get the contacts a girl had to help me get the contacts out of my eye but that was my whole story of The Hunger Games look I hope you guys loved it it was so much fun it's so much fancier than my normal videos I love it I hope you guys liked it too um and you guys are probably excited to see The Hunger Games fountain see like the crazy hair and makeup that's what I was most excited to see too so make sure you guys follow me on snapchat Instagram Twitter Facebook

hi guys it's candy and look who I have as a special guest Nicole let me know as Snooki yes I have brought a bag of my favorite drugstore makeup and she's got a bag of hers and we are going to exchange our gift bag see what's inside so as mom's I feel like we like to stand budget especially get makeup so I feel like it's get cheap makeup that does the same purpose like yeah $200 concealer that I would never buy and sometimes are even better than my fan hundred dollars $60 mascara - I love Chuck stormy are you ready to see what drugstore makeup I got you sent a calorie free donut bag me too just a real pearl nobody isn't it looking like looks like pearls imbalance this is awesome so this is the physician formula highlighter I think this is better than like the higher-end like Chanel and fancier highlighters I love this you look like you're glowing energy somebody shiny to you like a mermaid no and it doesn't have glitter I'm not a fan of like glittery it's like you get like this when you turn the light just catches and you look out your cheekbone the kunafa earring atom and you get a little pearl I know it's like a little bit jewelry cool I mean can't go wrong with eyelashes no and these are the demi wispies which are my favorite so if you like cut those last two clump guys off and you just put him on the outer part people won't even know you have false lashes on they'll just be like 1sq right these are my clots Easy's in my favorite two ardell demi whispies and then to go with those new duo blue yeah or else they're not gonna stay on your eyelid right okay this is just a good thing that you can have and these eyelash tools it's the same thing if you buy like expensive one or the cheap one but nails eyelash curling not really excite sometimes good extension so I don't want to like oh yeah you don't want to bend them yeah but when you don't have them in I used to you set yeah in high school I love guessing revolutionize your mascara application yeah these are the double extend tubes so this side you put a primer on which is kind of like art like the liquor bra like for your eyelashes like it lifts and dustings and then this you put on second and it's got these little two guys though like it will not smear off under your eyes the only ways it comes off is with hot water and then they totally come off in tubes off of your your eyes really so you never get that under eyes smudgy stuff yeah is it waterproof I don't know if this one is they make a waterproof one though long wearing smudge proof easy removal waterproof lens can smell weird to me so liquid liner oh this is not just regular liquid let me open it yeah it's matte liquid liner like a one liquid liner by your China yes matte lips my eyes max your whole body there's expensive ones from all different other brands but this is like the same and it totally is not shiny so you want to have patent leather eyelids and it's like small so you like put it like in your pants you could totally that and a lip liner like that was nice and I know what else is inside this is lip liner this is this is the nude one this is just like spice a whirl or some of those other expensive ones that everybody uses Kylie Jenner lip looks to redo but it's super cheap that stays on forever and it's like a beautiful shade I love it yeah I like I don't know if I put more on the fun yeah I did I forgave you so many really good this is East End snob you just color it is a mainly a pink yeah but it's like a nude rodent a nice exit like I have this one this color in the outside you're like oh that's not the right color but then we put on is totally different but that everybody should just go by that - that's awesome then last one so this color is tough as taupe and this you can use as a brow color this is way cheaper than like looks purple well it won't look like that on your eyebrow it'll look just like a light brown color but it's like got the tattoo coverage so it stays on your eyebrows will not come off like it's not do you wash it and this is way cheaper than like getting the expensive like honest off you dip brow or those that are like really expensive I don't even know her that like too expensive we only hope you know that you have this yeah yeah I love your bag already this is so cute oh I love this mascara also so I feel like every girl that ever Shops at a drugstore has this mascara it's amazing it's amazing it's not clumping and mixture eyelashes look amazing and this is like my go to mascara seems like a trick I love it all so we're all ready makeup soulmate oh the Revlon Photoready so I love this stuff because I put it on when I feel oily or gross you know being on camera a lot like you got to keep checking your pics you don't have like a drowned rat yeah so I basically put this on to just keep my face looking nice and like pretty and not so oily and the photo ready line I don't know what is in it just makes you look like amazing yeah and I love it just one my favorite whoo what I need there's two of these guys your Revlon airbrushing see this whole Revlon Photoready collection is amazing so I use Mac and colors but now that I've tried this stuff I mean it does the same thing yeah so um I like to get two different colors because sometimes I'm tan or I'm not tan you can find contouring and I got a mixer or just find my color but these are so easy to put on and it's great and I almost thought we both got the same exact care of eyelashes but these are the glamour yeah lashes so sometimes I like to double these yes um if I want to be like dramatic but this is like my everyday eyelash is the I love the 105 yeah 104 that way where yep if you double them up you do to 105 or another kind I needed you to 105 or the double up our dough oh yeah blot that's already ready to go for you these are everyday wear I love these soft matte lip creams you I do not have San Paolo so I like to try out different lipsticks at drugstores and this is my new favor it's so hard to try with the drugstore because you can't like there's no samples yeah you want to try it you either some of the other open one people are like using them like this house and you're like don't get it bacteria it don't touch them well yeah do not put it on your mouth okay you open that will I get this guy out what are these cult I love all these matte lip colors from NYX yeah so Alabama latest obsessions perfect red mmm I think I might own this perfect red see I'm gonna put it on hmm this looks just like Max maybe we'll oh I love that color is that your favorite like what's your favorite lip color I like colors like this the one I'm wearing yeah because it kind of goes with my hair as your hair yeah and I like nude sometimes but then I feel like my lips aren't like big with nudes yeah so I like your mouth disappears when it's nude yeah I'm gonna kill you where do you know I don't know who wouldn't have taken more sexy dark color this also looks like it told me goes with your hair yeah these are like my kind of shake colors but I like because it matches my hair you should always match your lips to your hair unless you have like black hair cuz looks a little daunting oh I have not tried these yet the Maybelline the new a lot of people buy that $50 palette yeah naked is it yeah this is like the same thing it's so much cheaper look at all the balls they're like almost identical so I use that as like a highlighter yeah and then this I put um you know all over the eye and then smokey eyes obviously no I can use this for multiple things this is beautiful this is like almost the same to that color and all those new bells yes and it's way cheaper can't the price if we didn't have makeup on we could have done like a challenge

follow me on snapchat interrupt Twitter Facebook all those places I can be jump in so the first thing I'm going to show you guys I'm a little bit obsessed with I not stop using it since I got it is the urban decay melt the makeup remover dissolving spray I like this because it is oil free so for everybody to have like I know I don't have eyelash extensions but I know people do have eyelash extensions you have to use oil free eye makeup removers and it gets everything off your eyes even like liquid lipstick and like this bright red one I would just I spray it in my hand rub it around comes right off spray it it takes everything off of your eye I love this death Urban Decay ml the look of remover okay next it so my mom taught me this and she was like you should take this this biosilk hair skin nails I used to take this a long time ago and then I just like onwards I brought about or something but this is what it does well it gives you healthy bones and joints another great it gives you the strength to do nails it's taking and strengthens your hair it reduces fine lines and wrinkles and I'm going to tell you like a testimony that my mom has this thing I don't know if it's eczema or what the life of a palms over hand but crack open and light bleed it's like really terrible my mom started taking this not like oh my gosh mom your hands look so much better and she's like I've been taking this biosilk stuff another what and she's like I bought you a bottle too so I wouldn't go up not even go out on the limb like my skin is looking better and so I'm just not going to stop taking this stuff so thank you mother for buying that for me another favorite thing hello there sharing this always must look at these pink slides from adidas I love Vegas kind of like peach they're like a peachy pink actually but I saw these in the sort of like I need to have a pair of peachy pink slides so these are going to just either another one my favorite then also if you guys follow me if you were just you don't want that in the surroundings mapped out and we're well AM Facebook put my clothes everywhere but um today I did Katy Perry's makeup for her livestream she did so if you follow me on there you would have known that and that was awesome and then also I get this thing at Clinique if you guys wanted serum so I posted a thing I feel like I just tell you my social media but I'm just referencing photos and post I already did over there but I did this thing Clinique and then I walked into the hotel room in the bathroom it was the most amazing display of makeup lined up everywhere I was just like oh this is amazing they have like all these blushes and things there so I never used this blush ever before this is a cheek pop blush in pink pop I am obsessed with this you can see how much I've worn I'm wearing it today I've worn it every single day since I tried this because it's like the perfect blush of pink it's pink pop from Clinique I love this color and then while I was there they also have this one this it says lid pops that with an eyeshadow in petal pop but I use it as a highlighter let me just show you wrong hang on behind I don't know if you can see this shimmer but it is gorgeous so I just like I would do a little there I do a little here move down the nose and I love it so petal pop and pink pop I just I don't know I don't know why I never tried those I love these things what else I also been using okay so I just don't like a couple things we're gonna be a very short favourites video I emptied this whole jar so I've been drinking this every morning for breakfast is from paleta I think that's how you say the name purify + macronutrient plant legs banana protein supplement powder so it's got 20 pounds protein a potay a protein I drink this and then I mix this with something else it's quite interesting so this is called mouth it is pure pecan milk and maple flavor is cold-pressed wha-wha-wha organic all that good cutting no gluten no dairy no fillers no binders no soy no carrageenan so all this stuff is great because um if you guys saw in like I think I my last videos like my little updating video or whatever so I'm not supposed to have Wooten and supposed to have dairy just for like health reasons to just feel better look better clear up all the health issues and that we're going on so I put this in here is delicious there kind of tastes like maple syrup so I put a little bit I put like four ounces of this with this shake and then for onto the water she can't drink it totally full and I feel delicious it's not for weight losses all health stuff but this is what I drink some milk I get this at my health food stores called Erewhon near me but I don't do that maybe you could like ask Whole Foods or

work went into this palette you guys I don't even want to say blood sweat and tears because it was so much of my love of my heart my drive was worth every bit of this to make this perfect I'm so glad I joined with Too Faced because these are high quality pigments these are there's no cheap fillery makeup things in here this is makeup that's gonna last all day long I put this on like 13 hours ago the pigment still looks amazing the blend ability I wanted the blend ability be outstanding I don't want just something that swatches great on the arm because it's full of oily if this was like professional level blend ability on your eyes I just like so much work went into this and I hope you guys feel it and loved it so much okay so let's just get started and show you the rest of the palette and everything so the collection is going to consist of the island candy eyes shadow palette the banana powder it's like a perfecting powder for your skin the candy glow highlighter stick for liquid lip colors that I absolutely love and last but not least the candy liner so I'm gonna go through all these things and show you them so this is the box that comes with it can you see that and then on the back it has each of the little colors their names and then inside there's a little candy recipe booklet and this is very beginner so this I wanted this to be very friendly for people that are makeup artists or experts but I also wanted to give some beginner tips in here too so there's a bunch of little like eyeshadow recipes that are just basic neutral looks that you can do with the palette so if you're starting out maybe it's the first palette or you're just getting started makeup 101 this will be a little instruction guide for everybody so that gives you like a little boost of knowledge how to use it and then everybody's like a pro makeup artist like you can just you don't have to use that if you don't want to so so this is a little tin it's so cute you guys it's metal and you can see it's curved it's like a little vintage candy tin and then it's sealed with this little sticker hopefully I can peel it off with my with my nails and then on the back it looks like a little candy tin it's got the description of all the different colors in here and then inside it's got like this little paper just like you're getting a chocolate a chocolate bar thing and again this comes out September 3rd it'll be at Ulta and Too Faced calm I don't know if we're even going to be able to do a reorder of this they have so many lines coming out I don't know if they would do another round of this or not so if you want to get it it will go live at 9 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the 3rd on Two Face calm and at all ulties so once it sells out I don't know if we're gonna be able to actually get any more so maybe don't wait till the fourth maybe just go on the 3rd so these are all the different shades it's hard to tell because this light is pretty bright exactly how they look so they're gonna look a little brighter than they normally are now these bottom three shades are going to be your mixers you can use them as basis I personally love this whipped cream for it perfect when you want a really good highlight for highlighting down the center of the nose you don't want it bronze or pink or any color you want just to pure white the white highlight that would create that the line that you'd see so I love this for a highlighter that's not too white it has just enough warmth in it but it's the perfect mixture for highlighter and then these two banana cream has yellow undertones banana cream pie and ice cream has pink undertones so what you do with these is you can wear them alone if you happen to be this fair that you could wear these or you can use these as a mixer for any of these shades so what you can do is you can lighten any of these shades with any of these mixers so this would be your yellow base so he can lighten any of these to be lighter with yellow undertone and then this can lighten any of them with a pink undertone to keep them cooler so say you this sugar plum color but you want it much lighter mix him in the cooler family to keep him with the ice cream or say you want to say you want to cool down sugar pink and you want him more light and more icy high light mix them with ice cream if you want to make this frosted pink a little bit warmer but not as bright as him you can mix the banana cream pie and him together you can lighten up the top lighten up the raspberry cocoa the hot chocolate any of these colors you can use kind of like as magic eye shadow transformers to change any of these colors same thing with the whipped cream you can lighten up and frost any of these colors anymore and make them frosty and lighter with this guy to which I personally love him as a highlighter you can use them if they match your skin tone but you can also use these as a mixing medium so me as a makeup artist I wanted to design this also with from coming from a makeup artists standpoint which is what I love so much about Too Faced is Jared started off being a makeup artist before he started two-faced so what I love about this is you can use these these are like your playground I wanted you to get a lot of different options out of this and I thought these may be fun to play with as mixing tools so they have the bigger pans here and here they are on my arms so this is the frosty the whipped cream which I love this as a nose highlighter then you have our pink undertone which is ice cream and you have the yellow undertone which is banana cream pie so these are your perfect color changers if your fair enough you can wearing with your base and then this guy I just love him all the time look at these in the Sun you guys look at that whipped cream color this is so beautiful so first I'm going to be swatching these four right here on my arm with no primer or anything at all we have this top color which is sparkling cider right here we have this color which is pastry right here this color butterscotch is right there and sweet toffee is right here you can see them in bright bright light and then this is in more natural darker light and there they are in sunlight so the top color here is a nice neutral color creampuff this is the hot chocolate this is frosted pink and this is sugared strawberry look at the sheen on those colors I love them you ready for these babies in the sunlight look at those Frost you guys I just want to bite them the highlight those are gonna make okay guys now we're going to do the last quadrant so this is the sugar plum frost raspberry cocoa licorice rope and this taupe berry which is like the stone gray with like topia it's like the perfect taupe matte grey so these are all of them on my arm there's the black licorice on top there's the taupe berry there is the raspberry cocoa that color is amazing and there is the sugar plum okay guys so there is the licorice rope on top and again no primer anything underneath these this is the taupe berry that is the raspberry cocoa and then there is the sugar plum and I'll show you guys in the brights I love this color and there they are in the bright sunlight look at this color you guys these Frost's are just amazing licorice rope which is the black which we did so much work to get this black the most inky deep dark pigmented black that we could make like so much work was gone into this even remaking it with a new formula at an entirely different lab because we wanted it so so so black a lot of these shades were reworked a lot of these shades were colors that I would mix you know two to three four shades to make these colors and I just wanted them to exist in one color so these are just colors that I've wanted to exist that I've mixed a bunch and then I finally got to make them so this is awesome so these are 15 all new shades the finishes the formula everything it was designed because I want this to be the best quality that you guys are gonna get for your money whether this is your first palette or your fiftieth palette really as a makeup artist I put so much of my heart into this to make this plastic colors that you need I didn't want any crazy colors that beginners I'm gonna use or play with I wanted this to be an everyday palette that you want to use every single day and maybe if you go on a trip or vacation this is the only palette that you'll need so for the last nine months I have tested this out I've worn this every single day I've worn a shade from this on my eyes this can be your one-stop shop that all you need is the colors that are in here to create your basic day everyday looks not a lot of while I put a little fun colors in there you know the Purple's the warm orange II Capri colors so I want this to be like your basics you know everybody probably has their crazy color palettes or crazy color eyeshadows but I wanted this is just the essentials of colors so if you are a makeup artist you have your lightest shades to mix with but you can play and make so many more colors out of these 15 shades because these are perfected shades I wanted to create I didn't tell you that this smells like candy everything is candy scented in this collection it smells so delicious you guys like it's like a treat for your nose so all fifteen new shades in the I want candy palette now let's move on to the colors because you know I love me a little bit so these are the four limited edition all exclusive new never existed before shades from Too Faced so we have I'll show you out of the cases so these are how adorable their packaging is and it's a liquid matte lip color because I'm obsessed I'm obsessed with liquid matte lip colors I got to name every single color in this collection every single one so these are all of the shades this is sweet and sour this is freshly baked this is melted ice cream and this is tropical punch now this is what I'm wearing today with a red lip liner I've been wearing this everyday for months and every time somebody asks in my lip color I felt so bags that have to be like it's my lip color that's coming out I love this this hot pink I took I love this color and I'm going to show you different mixtures how you can mix these together and make multiple colors then this is the freshly baked which I love it's like the perfect nude rose color for anybody and it's got like warmth in it and then this is my magic guide this is melted ice cream probably my most used color ever because really this is like a lip color transformer so if you don't like any these colors in the collection just go by this color because it will change your whole world so any color that you put on any color lipstick that you have on this was designed to highlight to lighten and highlight your lip color to plump make your lips look fuller and rounder and give that dimension that everybody's gonna ask what is that lip color because you're making a multi-dimensional with this highlight so this makes anything like it has warm undertones so even if you have your deepest darkest color and you put this on it's gonna lighten it and still give it warmth and not make it look chalky the melted lipstick formula is literally like liquid on your lips it gives like a plumping effect I can smile as wide as possible there's no cracking there's no dryness I can move this no cracking of the lip color I have had this makeup on for over 12 hours since this morning when I left and I have touched up none of it except for I touched up my lips because I ate like a bunch of food but other than that everything else is stay put I'm going to show you the magic of the melted ice cream so what you do do you dab this in the center right here on the top curved part of your lip and the top inside part there okay and then you you can press there like this and you can dab it over your finger and it gives you a three-dimensional like it instantly makes your lips look fuller and rounder no matter what color you put on you can also wear this alone with like a nude a taupe a spicy lip liner and it's like a perfect nude but this is probably one of my most used colors so is this sweet and sour like I took these on vacation with Google only two lip colors I took I love these guys so much these two together amazing and then this again you can lighten it with this and it looks incredible I love these I'm gonna swatch these for you guys too so this is the tropical punch I love this color and you'd be amazed at how amazing this looks and makes everybody's skin look incredible and glowy and you can darken it up with a red hot pink even like a plummy lip liner a deep purple it looks incredible and then next we have sweet-and-sour which is like my favorite this is like my favorite of all favorites I love color I'm going a little wild with my brush but the pigment is amazing you guys it's so beautiful it's so rich it's so gorgeous you guys this smells so good it smells like candy frosting like it smells so good oh my gosh it's smells so good we went through so much work to get the perfect scent of this not too sweet not too whatever I want it like eat it it smells so good and then here is our freshly baked this is like the perfect nude rose color that is just I mean the pigment of this is just so good you guys I love this color and I worked so hard to create this perfect shade with just enough warmth just enough cool just enough neutralness because the thing I didn't like is a lot of those shades of beef to mob to orange to this to that and then here is my baby so this is my melted ice cream which I love everybody was like that color is not gonna work nobody's gonna want that color and I was like this is the most used mixture that I would mix four shades to get and I use it every day so this is probably gonna be my most used shade ever but these are so great guys and so long wearing I love them so this is the sweet and sour shade with a red lip liner and this is how I wear a tropical punch I put a layer of this on the lip I line it with a red lip liner then I put another layer on top just to give the edge one always define your lips with a lip liner to define the shape and to give dimension to the edges so this is tropical punch and this is freshly baked with a nude rose lip liner because if you watch our video you know I don't everybody looked all around without a lip liner I wanted to do lip liners in the collection but also said they thought that was too much stuff but I could have done one too and to show you one of my favorite combos I take the melted ice cream and I dab this on top of the freshly baked like that right there press it together take your finger and blend it you get an ombre effect and you you get sexy more voluptuous looking lips look at how much bigger that made my lips that's why you need to buy this melted ice cream color because it's amazing and you can also wear melted ice cream by itself I just have a spicy brown lip liner with it so you can use it as a highlighter and lip transformer or you could wear it by itself with just a brown a spicy lipliner like this and these colors you guys I have tested these out like I've worn these all day at the beach when I was on vacation I wore these all days on different shoot they don't crackle they don't smudge they look perfect for so long it is like this formula is amazing the scent is amazing and again if you guys want these I don't know if you want this color I'm gonna like literally stock up on like 10 or 20 of them because I never want this color to go away because I will use this forever next I'm so excited about this banana powder so this is the I want candy banana pudding and it is scented like button like Nilla wafers you know like those little those little cookies so this is a little palette you can just pop this in your purse and this is a brightening perfecting this is like having a filter on your face but in real life you're not using it on a camera and I want you guys to see do you see the little different color specks and particles so those are all just used to diffuse light so I have one out of the pan so you can see those little specks in there there's lavender there's blue purple there's pink all those different colors are going to diffuse and reflect light so basically there's ingredients here that kind of shatter and blur light reflections so when it like hits the skin and bounces off it makes it look deflected and blurred and perfect this is even guys could use this to make their skin look perfect it gets rid of redness ruddiness it's kind of just like a magical product so what you want to do with this is I put this underneath my eyes you guys 12 hours ago over 12 hours ago now almost 13 I haven't touched it up it looks perfect I put my regular face powder and then I just put this on top so we're not gonna see a difference but I'll just use this Beauty Blender so you just dab it and then you just well maybe you will see a difference actually you just dab it under here in that triangle area to create a highlight and it just creates this lift on the face actually you can see it do you see how bright and diffuse this made it look right here you guys this product is literally amazing wherever you have redness it cancels out redness it cancels out and knocks out the purple and blue tones underneath the eye it works on any skin color because all the little different rainbow of colors are here reflect the light on the skin and so it just kind of cancels out any red tones any purpley tones so I'm gonna even it out over here but you could literally see the before and after of how well this works and I set my face like this you guys have not touched this the rest of the day but it makes this eye area look stinkin amazing this is like this is like everybody should have this just key this in your purse whenever you take a selfie it's something like amazing so this banana brightening face powder it just brightens and deflects it blurs it's literally like a filter in a compact this stuff is incredible somebody asked me today if you could use this for baking on the face baking is very heavy what it is it's like making a cake mixture like you're putting an oily foundation and then you're stopping all that oil up with a bunch of powder so it looks very heavy and crinkly so these under eye wrinkles are gonna look really crinkly and heavy you could do that if you like that heavy look but what this is going to do is it's going to provide a light layer of perfection I put this on all day long none of this crinkled up none of this did that you just push it into the skin to set it and your skin looks brighten lifted all of this looks like it was flattened it was even it literally looks like you used an app or something to filter all this to make it look smooth I literally love this stuff so much last but not least oh it not last but not least almost last but not least this is the candy glow Luminizer which this is amazing this is a special unique product so it's the candy glow Luminizer like this and I'm gonna show you guys I'm gonna show you up close on my hand this highlight because it is a amazing you guys look at this highlight it is amazing look at this you guys this is just like a silvery moon highlight which I totally love you can use this as an eyeshadow base you can use it underneath the brow to highlight right there I'm gonna just show you the formula of this is really crazy because it's a cream powder so you can just blend this in and you can lighten it and blend it like a powder so it's not like a cream that's gonna go on crazy oily and remove your makeup you can even just dab it on the cheekbone like this and then you can just Pat it with your finger to kind of spread it and soften it and look at my cheekbone you guys look at what that does I'm gonna put some over here so we're evened out and you guys look at that cheekbone look at that cheekbone glow it's gonna add this moonlight glow to any skin color it's not too warm it's not too icy cool it just adds like this strobing effect to any skin color and one of my favorite tricks is you can do nose highlighting really easily with this so you just you can just either draw a straight line down here or you can dab it and then you perfectly just you balance it with your finger you just you just spread it out with your finger and then if you want to do like that tip of the nose highlight you can totally do that so you just dab that there you guys just look at how much better that made my nose you can also put this right underneath the brows you can do this before you put your shadow but I'm just going to put it on top you can add this as a base you guys look at the highlight this is like the in this formula is just amazing it's not a cream it's like a cream powder stick so it's like really easy and fun to use you can use this on the inner corner as a highlight base then put your eyeshadow on top that I mean you can do endless things with this I love this it smells like candies too okay now we're down to our last but not least this is the candy liner and this is very innovative you guys it dries down to a waterproof formula it looks like this now this is very innovative you guys he has a very new innovative shape tip so you can see he's got a flat tip bristle like so so you can make wide strokes you can make thin strokes this is very new technology for brush shape something very innovative that we got to do and this again is really great for beginners because you kind of stamp the color along because it gives you a flat line so I'm going to show you guys on my arm you can kind of just it makes a little dash like that so you can either draw a straight line so you can draw a straight line you can kind of stamp it along the eye line so that you get a perfectly straight line as well and then you could do also little designs like say you want to make a little a little star pattern on your eye or anything fun that you want to do it's really crisp and then you can make a wide line or you can make a wide taper and just taper off the points and then to do point work you can turn him to the point of the pen and you can really make it pointy and taper it as pointy as you want it to be and this really dries down to a waterproof formula that is lasts all day and all night and I just want to show you guys like a little rub test like look at you guys I can rub back and forth over this like pulling on the skin and it doesn't smudge like this is so amazing and does not move anywhere like this is so good you guys okay so that was it guys let me know in the comments below which

dark shades and I'd mix them with my Bonnie Belle chapstick and I'd put him in a vitamin pill box with my different shades I made and and I I love makeup since then and then I became a makeup artist

hi guys so you guys have asked me to do this review on this foundation and why I am in love with this like I've never loved a foundation before in my life it is the clinic beyond perfecting foundation which I am so in love with this foundation I can't even tell you how much I'm gonna tell you why I love it and all those kind of things because with my full review I'm going to show you how I put it on in the difference of it half my face half not and all that stuff in a second so the first thing I tried every different foundation from Mac makeup forever Dior Armani L'Oreal Maybelline every different foundation you can think of I have probably tried that and sometimes they're too heavy too cakey I don't like the coverage if you like a light coverage like if you have freckles and you still want to see the freckles you still want to see the redness in your skin you're gonna hate this foundation because this gives you superb lots of coverage which I love and it doesn't feel heavy it doesn't feel oily cakey or greasy or anything and it stays great from the morning until you wash it off I just did a video with my mom yesterday and she was like can you just put a little makeup on me before I just put a little bit of this instant powder and she was like oh my gosh you look like a whole new person I was like I know if this stuff is amazing so it's already tested it's fragrance free it gives you a matte finish without drying and feeling crackly but the one thing you always want to do and I have super dry skin is you want to put your moisturizer on and then you want to put a primer this is going to plump up and hydrate your skin so if your skin feels dry it when you put this on it's just going to be amazing and then you want to set it with a powder so I'm going to show you guys right now how I put it on myself so I'll show you like this it comes like this with this little twist guy you can get it okay they can color match you there but you know they may match you right on if they don't go back to the store and just keep getting till you get the color right um so it comes with this little like velvet wand so I just use them to a pile over do not apply it with this if you do you'll be like this foundation is horrible what is kandi talking about because this is not a good applicator system I use my Beauty Blender which makes it look like flawless and amazing and it's $27 so you can get it ultra Macy's I think strong Dillard's places like that and you can color match it there take it back with the wrong color and really the areas that you want to spend money or invest in and maybe I'll make a whole video on this but for this one you want to splurge on your foundation your powder and your concealer it doesn't matter how great your smoky eye is if your skin looks all blotchy or too cakey or there's no coverage or any of that stuff so this is where I always say to splurge as foundation concealer in your powder that's where you want to get the bang for your buck so you just skin amazing um so I'm going to show you how I put it on and really quickly and I'll show you the half and half difference of what time look close without it and at the end of the night when I wash my face off I was like oh oh that's what my blotchy red skin looks like okay great but this is also great if this is too much coverage for you what you can do is mix it with a little bit of your moisturizer just do a little bit of moisturizer and foundation on you'll just have like a light lighter perfect looking coverage and it will last you probably like two or three times longer if you do it that way but as for me I like very full coverage I want to look like a Barbie doll I want to like I am a doll that has perfect skin and that's why I love this stuff and a little goes along light also so let me show you me putting it on and then I shall return Emma make it so first I'm going to show you applying it and what you want to do is especially if anybody has dry skin before you put any foundation on you want to make sure that you put your moisturizer and if you have really dry skin or imperfections or you just want like extra perfect dewy skin and perfect perfect looking skin you can put a primer on which I use I use the Marc Jacobs coconut primer and then I originally bought the Clinique in these three different colors which kind of look pretty similar but for me a neutral is the color that works best for me I'm going to show you how I put it on do not put this on with just this little applicator and rub it around it will not look good that way and I tried it it just doesn't come out as good as when you use a Beauty Blender so I'm going to use a Beauty Blender um this one is dry you're supposed to use them wet that's how you get the perfect application and you should go do that I'm just lazy right now and mine is dry and I'm going to put on and to be honest that's how I do it most of the days and it still comes out perfect so what I do because it is my face I do like drawing this on and I'm going to show you guys just one side of covered with this I've also got a little zit on my chin which is great he's back again for an appearance and then I conceal I do the lip because you want the purest color pigment that you can and then also around the nostrils any trick you're just doing half the under eye area and then we're going to do half of our shoot moving just flopped right in that foundation and then we'll wind it down onto our neck I need my knee here because I kept doing everything about it so we're just going to blend this in and it just evens out the skin and makes it look perfect and just even so you could really just go like this put a little mascara and then head out the door and you look fine now this is going to be a little more yellow than my natural skin color which is what you want you don't want to match your skin in its red and pink undertones you want something to air them a little more golden or yellow side so just got rid of the redness already and then you always want to blend wool blend up under your neck you're just going to do a whole neck while we're at it because you're not going to see a difference on my facebook even though on to the ear cuz that's part of your face okay now this is like an amazing difference like you wouldn't even need concealer can you just see the difference like look it up watching red and all the redness around my nostril and eyelids and everything and then just look how even and flawless this side looks great this side looking a little blotchy got some freckles got some under eye circles showing this is just this is crazy okay so now I'm going to put this on the rest of my face to even this out and you don't even if you just want light coverage you don't even need to do a concealer but if you want to you can if you just want extra coverage I like more full coverage so my skin just looks like a porcelain doll and I don't look real and that is like the comments you'll get as so many people asking what why your skin looks so good without it looking really cakey or heavy so we're going to just when when Lin you couldn't put you can build this up and put in another layer it totally already hit the zit that was on my chin so that is awesome and now if you want you can add a little bit of concealer like if you have any skin discoloration or imperfections or a little bit so I'm just taking the cap on the lofty concealer and I'm just putting a little extra under my eyes just so I look a little more right and a little more I'm going away like that just dab arou now you want to set your foundation with a powder if you don't do it it's going to slip off it's going to fall off if you feel like your skin is to dry your you still need it because it needs to soak up the extra oil that's in your foundation and some of the foundations I know that both are long-lasting they have more alcohol in them so they're going to be more drying to your skin so they may last longer but they're going to be a little bit more drying so you can just use any translucent powder which is what I'm going to do and you just I just press it into the skin around the nostrils everywhere that you want to set it so it doesn't just slip off your face then I'm going to go ahead and put the rest of my makeup on like normal so you can see the finished look but that was me applying the foundation ready to see step two of makeup mist are you ready here you go okay so that was it guys after I did my powder you know what I didn't do I did not do my contouring today oh well I'm gonna do a video on that coming up soon anyway um but this is the level of coverage that you get that is amazing this lasts so long like all the day long you could be doing it at 1218 hour day and it's still gonna look beautiful I personally have slept in this and when I wake up my skin still looks amazing I cannot tell you how much I love this stuff it is awesome you can even mix if you don't find your right shade mix like two colors that will make your perfect shade or something I hope it comes in everybody shade because this it I don't know when I've been so

subscribe to me if you happen for more tutorials and things and then let me know other books you guys want to see below falling on snapchat Twitter Instagram Facebook all those places in the other time when you're not watching videos okay let's get started showing you how to do these eyes okay so we're gonna get started I already put my foundation on because everybody knows how to do that's what if you don't I'll put a link below to it just takes a long time and this will make the video shorter so once you get all your foundation on come on back and fire up this tutorial and we will do our makeup together and again I'm going to show you what I'm using you guys can use any makeup that you want that looks similar just I'm just showing you the colors I'm using you guys find something similar so this is the Tarte on the in bloom palette and I'm going to take this light color you want like a light flesh color and that's what we're going to we're going to kind of go from right above the crease or if you don't have a crease right above the midpoint where you want to start going up towards your brows we're going to put that down is like a base color so in case we get any of the darker colors around it won't stick then I'm going to take our lightest color and we're going to put that right underneath the brow camera you need to focus okay focused there we go now to get this really inky and your lash line I'm going to take a black eyeliner I'm just using this Tarte it's like the double-ended ones there's like a felt liner and then a black liner and I'm just going to go right in at the lash line and we're going to start getting that really black right away and we're going to go all the way in the corner and then we're also going to do a little too tight lining so I'm just going to go look up and then we're just going to do the bottom while we're at it so we're just going to I'm just going to kind of fill in this whole part of the lower lid if you don't have a lower lid you want to create a curved shape like half circle like I'm doing you just want to draw that on and you're just going to fill it in and like take that whole thing so I'm going all the way into my crease so before um that kind of sets in I'm going to take an angled brush and I'm just going to kind of spread this around and you can do that you can even just use your finger really hard when you got a long nail to do that absolutely then we're just going to kind of Pat and smudge him around now what you do to one eye you got to do the other so we're going to go ahead and do this to the other eye and if you like the messy you can just go wherever you're just basically covering it all black you really want to make sure you get near to laughs sinuses then if you have like the gaps there that's when it starts to look really weird so this is just a base that's really going to lock the black on it into our tight lining to look up ah put it on here so when you're done you're just gonna blend the edges we're going to put more eyeshadow over this so if you mess up don't worry about oh my gosh about on the tool again you know we're just going to kind of soften that a little bit you can use a q-tip or whatever you have to so if you make a mistake like that is no biggie you just fix it easily you just tap some concealer right on top I went to town smudging my black and looks like I just got it on a whole walk though then you got to take your press powder on top of there or if any powder falls down it's going to stick to glue like glue to the concealer you just like so then I'm going to take a little bit of a fluffier brush and I'm going to take that same red color and then I'm going to tap it on this lighter color so that that goes down first and I'm just going to get rid of some of that product here on the crease and we're just going to start gently smoking this up and out and the key to the blending this I'm going to take this lighter color now in rebel and I'm just going to go right up here but the real key to this is just blending is going back a war wagon board and you do that enough and then it looks like hey it's blended now I'm going to take the same leader color and we're going to go over here on this eye and blend him as well just back and forth blending up and outwards towards our brow and we're just going to keep building him up and out and then if you ever feel like you made a mistake just get like a darker neutral nude color and then you just blend the very outskirts and then that will kind of act as like your magic eraser so I'm going to get a little more this and finish off this side this lighting is not good for I this isn't really right and he's off in the shade so this isin love cries 8 when we're done I have moved and my house is not it's not totally done so I haven't been able to unpack everything and get everything out storage which is when we're lighting and filming equipment our so that's why my videos are looking probably not as awesome as they could be if I had my life so now we're going to go back in with our dark dark dark red-brown color and you're just going to really get in that crease I'm just like pushing the color into the crease right there just so it gets really dark and beautiful that I'm also going to bring it down onto the lid just a smidge onto the black and then I'm going to take this dark red-brown and we're also going to go underneath the eye really concentrating on the outer corners this is what gives that sultry little trick I love I kind of like to go right up to where like they tear duct is and then I stop right there and then I'll put like a more highlight color then we're going to take our lighter red Brown and we're going to do the same thing you're just going to kind of soften and and smoke that look up underneath the eye oh so and then blend your corners in right here so now sometimes when you do like all that smoking out with the other color it'll kind of like make the black not as dark so I'm just going to take my smudgy guy and then I'm just going to go right back over the black oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's totally working and just like intensify the outer corner right here that is looking good and that's where you really want to make it look the wackest is looking perfect so far now for the intercourse I don't want this to be like a shimmery shiny eye so I'm just going to take a little bit of this red and a little bit of like this nude color and I'm just kind of going to blend the inner corner I don't want it to look shimmery or frosty and then we're just going to blend up until here then right into the crease right there and then to finish off like any super blending just take like your pressed powder face powder I'm taking a Kat Von D press foundation and your Beauty Blender and I just start up at underneath the brow it's the lightest and you just kind of DAB and it will just blend all these guys that may have gotten a little wonky or crazy in any areas where it doesn't look lended just go back over with your Beauty Blender and your face powder and it'll just kind of like blend it in to perfection now for our last touches you should make it extra black I'm going to go back with my black eyeliner and we're just going to really get the lash line do the same thing over here to really get your smoky eye black you really want you off a whole eye is intense but just like right around the lash line where you want super intense so I'm just going to press my black shadow on the color I just put down and then right above so it just gives like extra it gives an extra to your eye I'm going to take a little flat brush whoa and I'm going to take my dark red and I'm just going to press him right here on top for one left level of blending and a little more black this may seem like a million billion steps but this is just what I would do to get this look and just really get the corner super dark and one like this outer V area right there just out of view your eyeball right there and then you can make the outside more smoothly if you want but now it is time the curl on lashes like so then we're going to do our brows lip and the whole look is totally going to come together I am using the tart tart issed mascara which I just got I have never used it before so I'm hoping it's very black and inky a lot of lashes oh my gosh of course I looked up and my lashes smeared it up here darn it if you catch it quick enough with your powder on a Beauty Blender you can just erase it oh that was close okay now time to do our brows and I'm just going to use the Anastacio dip brow in chocolate I'm also really liking the NYX taemin frame if you need a drugstore option too we're just gonna swim in like so perfect all corners of the eye brows every corner look at the difference of a brow no brows look at this just a regular hair eyebrow or that brow let me wait to a whole look at that it was a little crazy right now but it's going to look even better I'm going to do this side so you guys can actually see I'm doing okay now both brows are done and a river your eyebrows our sisters not twins so if they look totally different that it should if they don't that's weird okay so this amount is like it's a total Tarte video I'm going to show you guys this blush it's the tarp blush palette I just been loving these blush like this pink and then you just dust off the excess and I just love this color it's beautiful okay now if you feel like you need a little more depth or dimension I'm going to take this light color and you can go right above the crease and add a little more color then with a fluffy brush you just kind of do circular strokes and go up and out to blend it it was feeling like it needed just a smidge oh my gosh I keep putting wax stuff over here on this corner well we're gonna think so I will do that come right back in and do our lip balm lip or wall I always think it's really pretty to do a nude lip with a smoky eye I'm gonna be using pure Hollywood from honest off in Beverly Hills and I just said a dollar and if you need a couple of color options um two of my favorites are with this is 3c from Make Up For Ever and naked from urban decay or natural from NYX looks very similar I think we're going to go with naked it's still one of my favorite favorites and I overdraw mine because hey why not make your lips look bigger that's a little bigger gente ma wait almost tada then for the icing on our face cake I want to put the flutter lashes in Roxy you could use any Demi whiskey but I just love these and they just look they just look so dreamy on I'm also going to be using the slut to lash glue I'm gonna paint this in little strip font like that and these just go in like the outer corner and you can see the difference that the lashes make versus wow this just makes it look extra fancy fee also a side note I don't like my hair at all my curling iron that I've used for years since I started doing YouTube and before that um it broke it's like the most perfect sized curling iron for big big coils I actually won it in a contest in beauty school um many many years ago and it just I left it on apparently I left it on and didn't realize it was on I don't know how I did not notice that and look at those lashes my hairs other than my hair being crazy I love the makeup

Instagram well I'm snapchat and Twitter and Facebook and Pinterest candy Johnson follow me all over the place so you guys can tell me what you guys want to see so for this look I just wanted to be like we're doing our makeup together and you don't have to use the same colors that I'm using just use whatever you have that is close I'm going to go through describing everything in a second so I want to give you guys a second to get all your makeup out I will show you these eyeshadow colors to find colors that are similar I'm using the Gwen Stefani Urban Decay palette and the Tarte tartlet palette I love both of these so to get colors that match go ahead and get out we're going to be using this pump color this maroon color and then steady bathwater baby pop all these kind of coppery and Goldy shimmery frosty colors and also the black in there and then from the Tarte lip palette which I love these mats we're going to be using these kind of ivory and more peachy colors and then this lighter color is kind of taupey brown a topi gray and then this darker Brown I know it's a lot of colors but that's when you got a use for all these smokey eyes and then I'll show you the lip liner dupe and all that stuff get on your makeup out come get ready to do your makeup with me and you will love this look it's so pretty it just looks like effortless and just like the nude mouth looks like pretty and the eye looks like doesn't look like a crazy amount of makeup on it just looks pretty so let's get started in any time you guys want to do this come back watch with me I will do it together let's get started okay so the first thing I did was I put this Marc Jacobs the coconut primer all over my face that's kind of boring and I'm very exciting and then next I'm going to take this Clinique beyond perfecting foundation which I am I'm so obsessed with this I love this foundation I'll put it on with the beauty blender but I'm going to do that real fast cuz this again is kind of like a really boring step so here we go and if you want to use a concealer I'm using the Kat Von D locket concealer in medium 22 and I'm just putting it on the eyelids it's like extra coverage for our eyes yet it just will make sure that whatever eye shadow file you put on is really gonna show up and if you want you can put it under the eyes if you look extra awake if you've never seen it I have a video on how to get rid of under-eye circles with this like triangle technique I'll put a link for that below if you guys want to watch that too okay now we have to lock our foundation this is it's kind of like turning down a little and we have to walk our foundations so if you don't put a powder to set your makeup look it's just going to slip off and come off just like how how a lipstick will come off all day long same thing is with your oily um makeup so we're just going to put a translucent powder anyone work that you have and then you're just going to set your face so it doesn't come off and you can use a loose translucent powder which is one of my favorites because I feel like it's lighter but I also like you can use like a compact one this again is the Kat Von D on the locket powder foundation and you can use this just to lock through makeup off block it lock your makeup on so we're just going to do that make sure you get your eyebrows really well so if you do your eyebrows it's not like gonna slip off when you put your product on you want it to be very dry I always put a little extra under the eyes in case you get some fallout okay now it's time for the fun part now with all that face business out of the way and I'm going to be using two palettes and again you guys don't have to use this same exact palettes that I have I'm going to be using the tartlet from Tarte and the gwen stefani from Urban Decay because I love these two palettes so much so first I'm going to take on these and use any colors that you have that go with is so like a nude yellow this ivory color a brown and a topi color and that's what I window using so I'm going to take this light I'm going to mix these two we're going to put these on the inner corner of the eye and then sweep it back we're going to add other colors so we want to mostly concentrate here on the inner corners I'm going to take these same colors and go underneath are our brows my here is going crazy it's like so loud so we're going to dust this kind of all over real lightly then I'm going to take a little bit of this wanderer some of this force of nature a little bit of dreamer just kind of kind of mix all those and go right in the crease just to create a little bit of dimension then you want to blend up and outwards toward your brows you could also use any flap or smaller brush that you have same thing right here just kind of mix all these colors and just go right here if you don't have a crease right here just fake this curved shape onto your eyelid nill create the illusion of that I'm gonna take my this brush has nothing on it but I'm just gonna use it to blend blend up and outwards the key is blending blending blending like so okay then I'm going to go take a water line this is perversion from urban decay so it's one of my favorite black eyeliners and we're going to line the walk to line and we're going to do the upper eyelid as well perfect well we have him out we're going to go ahead and just line the top part of our eyelid we're not going to go into a wing and we're just going to kind of taper it off right here at the top of the eyes we want the heaviest part to be here on the outer corner we can't talk very serious business ah and you can smudge it with your finger if you feel like you've made a wobble like I did I'll bet you like it never happened now I'm going to take the black from the this the Glen palette and this is just actually a brush from a craft store it still has a little tag part they're just cheap and I really like them so I'm taking this flat brush and I'm going to take the black and I'm just going to press him down right where the lashes are like growing out of our eyelid this is going to make real smokey and make that black liner does not make a big raccoony mess and then again we're going to do the top right here just push him down into the lash line we're going to blend all this later so if it doesn't look that great now don't worry we're going to we're going to get more blending on top perfect now we're going to get some fun colors so this color I love this Punk color it's like a red maroon color and again you can take your flat brush so we're just going to get a little bit of him and then we're going to play some kind of right on top of the edge where our nude part in the edge of this black liner is and you're just going to kind of smudge him all along here and then we're going to blend more later but we're just going to do that right now we're getting a little bit of fallout great you can even go underneath here just on the outer corner though beautiful what have I got here to smudge with I'm going to take this little flat got any kind of smudgy guy war and I'm going to take a little bit of this red color maybe I will this brown just to lighten up the edges and we're just going to smudge up towards the crease and stop and all this up and we're going to add more so if it doesn't look perfect we still got more don't worry I have got get a dust this off of my face don't you smudge where did I just put that brush go right here so again we're going to take this this year oh this is Punk and then a little bit of those own the brown color and again just use other colors that you have that look like this we're just going to go up to the crease and just start the smoking of our eye smokey eyes are tricky because it's just like lots of layers on top of lots of layers well we are getting fallout like bananas okay now we're going to get a fun color so I'm going to clean up all this afterwards so don't worry um then we're going to take this steady color which is like a coppery coppery frosty color and I'm going to put him right on the center and when he's just going to add this warm glow these red colors and orange is they look pretty with brown eyes green eyes blue eyes every color either just so pretty and we just blend him so I decided little on the front a little in the back I'm going to get him again and I'm going to get a little bit of this baby color and we're going to just make a lighter version we're going to go right towards the inner center just the smell more pretty neat then I'm going to get this bath water and baby and a little bit of this pop that frosty your color we're going to go right on the inner corner that is very pretty and then for underneath the eye I'm going to take a little bit of this steady color and we're going to go right underneath the mid to inner corner of the eye right here and I'm going to get this lighter baby color and go right on the inner corner party now with a bigger dome shaped I'm going to get this punked color it may be a little black maybe a little more pumped and we're really going to get this crease to make him look darker right here go back into the crease a little and then just gently once the color is kind of coming off your brush I gently go blend him up and out to the sides I'm just grabbing whatever brushes I have laying around really at this boy then I'm going to take this zone color on a little fluffier and maybe a little this Anaheim in taupe so we just kind of soften soften that dark color we created there and just blend them upwards like that mmm okay now I gotta clean up this let's follow underneath my eye which I wasn't planning on that happening so I'm just going to take a little bit of my concealer and our sponge and we're just going to dab it on top with a Beauty Blender and seeing them look like so like it never happened and then take any of your powders that you have again if you do this and then you just want to dab it beautiful again I'm going to take this little smudgy eye and we're going to smoke out the bottom just a smidge more just on the outer edge right here with that red color maroon is not red and then you can add a little more wherever you feel you want to touch of it I didn't really even use this color at first and then I used it one day and I was like oh my gosh it's beautiful now I wanted to use it like every single day because it's so pretty so anytime you need to do extra blending like this take a brush that has nothing on it and you can just kind of smudge like an artist would do with a smudging tool you just kind of smudge around like that so if you want to take any more colors into the crease or make it darker we might take this multi tasker and a little bit of these three colors so a dark brown a taupe gray and then like a light peachy color and I'm just going to hit that Bromwell that's not even the problem that like I saw Khateeb own right above your crease or if you don't have a crease you're going to give the illusion of a crease here and then just keep swirling them up to you're like oh I don't see a line of demarcation who you haven't blended okay this is fun and beautiful now I think it's time to curl our lashes then we'll do our brows our cheeks lips so we're done and those are kind of fast so we're going to curl these guys and I'm going to show you on curling this tight line from IT cosmetics paint really really love this tool a lot so what I'm going to do is get right here up against the lashline do it gets so close to your lash line because the brush is so tiny it doesn't like get it all over your eyelid use wiggle like that do the bottoms also then we'll put our regular mascara onto I hope you guys are doing this along with me so it's like fun like we're doing our makeup so anytime you want to do this I look just pop this video on and we'll follow step by step and do it listening and I'm going to take these this is Tarte lights camera flashes I'm in love with this mascara and we're going to really build these guys up to crazy proportions so it looks like we've got false lashes what we don't hear is coat one I'm gonna splint and try to get darn it I knew it I knew I was gonna do it because I didn't wait for it to dry great now I gotta fix that wonderful oh my gosh always let your top guy don't try to do it I just did and hurry the whole process along I'm gonna fix that one they're dry let's do our eyebrows while we're waiting this is the almost tough suit Billy Hugh dipbrow I'm going to just take this little brush and we're going to color in our brows and I'll show you the difference because it's kind of remarkable so I'll do this like as you can see them better wiggle up here the song is on repeat if nobody's noticed so we start down here at the bottom I just kind of make my line across there make our line on the top whom I did brows like drying out and getting harder it still works get a little eyebrow tail ooh and fill him in a little more bottom day the little look at the difference of the brows it is amazing when I try to move him so as you can see go up right here and then I just try to draw a line do the top ah a little fuzzy I'm gonna do our little Taylor guy right here this is eyebrow taking so long I don't have time for you eyebrow okay so our brows are done now let's go back and fix blunder we've made underneath our eye I'm gonna take my splendid dab a little concealer remember any time you put a little concealer you gotta put a little powder or is it gonna smear everywhere all right now we gotta make him look all smoky again candy we're gonna get a little bit of this color gonna get a little more this Capri color perfect back in business will forgot to put a cap on can see what now would dry out and I'll be good now we're gonna put coat number 45 on our eyelashes just kidding I do like to look like so many coats to make them look like you got a lot of lashes ha you like my mascara face I can't help it I just go it's like a law a mascara applying law applying I was going to say application and then it went to apply plus I noticed I've got some mascara that I've linked up on the top of my eyelid again take your face powder dust him away like he never happened now we're going to do our cheeks this is a discontinued color so I'm not even a water telling you the name it's out extra dimension blush out to Rohtak I don't know what this is but I'm gonna put it on my cheeks I love this color it's like just like a rosy it's more of a rosy orange kind of color and I just thought we'd go with more orange and warm because the eye is like a little worm beautiful oh you know I didn't do any contouring or anything like that at all so let's just do some now shall we I'm going to take this is hoola from benefit I love this stuff it's doing a little contour right here corner the mouth up towards ah yeah you can watch my full full video on contouring the face I'll put that below if you guys want to see it it's a little more in depth than I'll get here for just our everyday makeup look I like to take the contouring color and put it right here on the ends of my

For Ever which is one of my favorite favorite colors if you don't own it you should just buy it this amazing if you need a cheaper dupe it's close this is the Revlon Colorstay and nude it's a little bit lighter um I'll show you the to the top is the one that I love the Make Up For Ever and then this is the Revlon so it's like it's just like a good cheap dupe but it's hard to find a dupe for this milkshake color because it's like this shaping I just haven't found too many that look similar to it um but we're going to line lips we're just going to go underneath and outside the edges because I like to break the rules and go outside the edges so I'm just going to go down here to the corner of the mouth we're going to shade this and my corners and they come down you need to give a dimension just like your shading and I otherwise it looks like if you had just put one eyeshadow color and then you were done so that's why you put the different layers four dimensions so same thing with a lip liner I never just wear lipstick I always wear a lip liner I've done this for years so then we're going to the top and then you're going to again shade the corners ah in Haryana fade and blend up now if you feel like it's too blotchy or anything I've got the trick to save you you're going to take a little bit more this color and you're going to dab it in the center of the top and lower lip and then you're just going to blend it with your finger just Pat it and spread it out and it perfectly blends it so it looks like a little defined you don't really tell the lip liners on there and you are all set with your makeup look for the day I promise you it's a lot faster when you're doing it and I'm not like showing you products and talking you can do this much faster than I did but if you guys want to do it along step by step with me every day come back and hang out with me and we can put the makeup on it's a really pretty look it looks simple like the nude mouth looks really simple and then I just looks like smoky and dreamy but not like crazy makeup like sometimes when you're like whoa it looks like I have a lot of eye makeup on it just looks like really gently smoky and beautiful

chandelier that I just got put in my kitchen I love chandeliers and want them everywhere maybe I just need to do like a favorite house things video like just favorite things in my house would that be a fun idea I think so oh you ready okay this first one I've never shown before this is very special near and dear to my heart I'm going to disclose to you this is sponsored because they sent me these for free but this is not just a regular story this is like a special meaning to my heart and let me tell you why so this is Sandford and I'm gonna tell you about it and why I think it's awesome but before that when I tell you the girls who started this she is beautiful she is amazing she's sweet she is one of our own candy family you guys she came when I make upset nurse she told me she was inspired from watching my videos to start this business I am so proud of her and this is so cool so let me tell you why I think it's so cold why I'm so proud of you for doing this so um this is the sunburn and what it is first they're these cute little like twist up perfumes they twist up like like a lipstick spray them on and then I kind of sprayed that um this is my signature scent to which today it is not my signature said I'm just saying that because I've worn it for like a bazillion years it is comfort food pacific vanilla extreme it says so right there on the packaging this is amazing and she started why what that was not even focused on my face till right now so sorry for Gloria first so she started selling this particular scent just um because I loved it so this is so cool so what you do is you pay 14.95 and it's not like a million subscription like makeup things it is subscription cents so every month you get to try a new set and I love how they say you get to date a fragrance before you marry it so you get to try it this is such a cool idea for a gift for somebody and I am such a big scent person I love smells I have to smell good even my little Ellie she was putting perfume on that I'm like what are you doing I she's like I have to smell good when I go to bed so this is amazing so you get a new scent every month and then they come in these cute little packages like this so I got I got another one also this is Viktor and Rolf flower bomb and let me just tell you don't waft it around this smells like what I imagined a glamorous Parisian apartment or hotel lobby in Paris this smells so so so so so good so this is so cool because you high-end really designer fragrances for just 4095 and you get a new delicious scent to try or to date every month so this would be good for yourself good for a present for somebody and I mean really 1495 what is that that's like three Starbucks drinks no ways they remember what you smell like but scent is one of the most powerfully connected things to your brain that's all you'll smell something then like equally from a billion years ago when you like oh my gosh this reminds me of something and I've had people

hi guys it's candy and today I'm going to show you the basics and how to contour your face with powder in less than 30 seconds this is really easy and contouring kind of seems like this big crazy process you have to draw these face charting maps and designs and artworks on your face with the highlighter and the in your contour color and then you blend and do all these things and it really can be really really simple just to do some basic contouring and it can be fast your makeup doesn't need to take you two hours to do you can just do something really quickly so I'm going to go over the basics I'm going to demo it on myself in less than 30 seconds so first brushes are really important and they I'm going to show you how you can use all different brushes to create the same effect so um you can use these kind of chiseling brushes and if you want to know its ac45 - from crown brush and this is a really good chisel a guy you get a really chiseled angled line right here if you're doing that and also down the sides of the nose this is a great brush for that this is um any kind of shape blush brush where you see it's kind of fluffy but it's like tapered an angle this helps create that perfect angled look that you get this will work - you can get all around the everywhere this is a little more multi-purpose than just a specific chiseling one um then this one I really like this is the Sigma tapered kabuki in f-86 I don't make any money off these brushes I'm telling you guys about there's no discount code below or anything I wish I had some for you guys you could save a little money but um this I really like the shape of this because you can really get in there you can contour then you can smash it down with your fingers do the sides of the nose or wherever else you want to and then on this any kind of fluffy brush like this that you can just fluff around this is the chiku hoto cheek one any fluffy one will work any kind of doesn't matter these these are more generic than these other guys that are shaped a little more uniquely and then for the powder so you can go ahead and do the cream if you really want to do some serious contouring that's when you use your creams but if you just take my hey I want to head out the door wanna do a little contour don't want to take forever um my personal favorite for my skin tone and everything is hoola from benefit you want to use a color that's two to three shades darker than your skin tone and as you can see this is you know little darker than my skin tone and you want to be Matt you want to have any shimmer frost Sparkle none of that you don't want to look like your like a bronze disco ball of glittery color you want it to just be a matte color with no shimmer at all so anything that you find is matte and is 2 degree shades darker than your skin color good to go even if you have darker skin tone and you can't find the right color in a face product you can even use an eyeshadow that is the same just a couple shades darker than your actual skin tone and I've contour with eye shadow before so you can use whatever you have now I'm going to show you the areas where we're going to apply it because when I'm doing my speed demo I won't be able to tell you that everything so basically where you want to contour on everybody's face it's not like those charts to have crazy design this works on everybody's face so you want to go here along the cheekbone and this would be the area where you would take a brush and you rock from the corner of the mouth to like the top of your ear right in there is the hollow of where everybody's cheekbone should be on their face so that's where you want to create the illusion of that depth in that shade in there like put sucked in we'll go to shade there and then you can take your brush and you can even shade underneath the lower lip because that's going to make it look like your lower lip is so big and plump it's making this shadow ever on everybody's face you want to shade the forehead the same you don't a giant forehead is not I mean I have a huge forehead I don't feel like it's like an attractive feature like oh I wanted me before I look bigger I want to make it actually look smaller and not so wide so you want a shade here by doing that it's gonna make this look more narrow and then also shape up by the hairline that's going to make it look like it's smaller not like wow let's highlight how tall my forehead is and then I like to do some quick shading on the eyes so I will just shade pre shade right here so you get like a little pre shadow action going on no matter what you're doing it just creates a nice shape to the eye and then to Splendor eyes are straight anybody's knows what I'll do is I'll take any of the brushes I'm doing flatten them down so you make it real flat and straight and then you're going to shade right down the sides you're going to leave this flat part highlighted right there and just shade a straight line right here and then I also do a V right here on the tip of the nose because it makes it look like you have this cute perfect but knee nose and then you have that's basically your instant bronzing you can go underneath the jawline and down the sides of the neck right here where you where you have these shadows to make this look a little more like contoured but that's basically it I don't normally do the neck contouring but you can go ahead and do that but now I'm going to go ahead and start a timer and we are going to see how quickly I can do the contouring on my face and my brush of choice today chisel guy normally like to really work these cheese Li lines in but for speed say I think I might use two I might use this fluffy guy and this shape guy and we could use a chili guy I got 30 seconds I feel like I could do all of this so on your marks Get Set sides I'll put on the temples already look at that look at that chiseling of our forehead of our big giant forehead and done I'm just a quick contouring it just makes you look alive and have a little more glow and it makes the eyes go to the part that sees a little more shadow or color or dimension be like oh that looks skinnier that looks like a depth that looks like a curve and then you can go ahead and put the rest of your makeup on and then you're all good to go so maybe I'll show an after picture with the rest of my makeup on or not hey I just go out like this but well mascara I'm good to go right now um let me know what other videos you guys would like to see VAP basic or like fast versions of comment that

go into my room shall we here is my room that goes to my closet that needs like to be a separate to her um this I think I got this vase at HomeGoods with those flowers so that's when you first walk in then as we turn the corner we have my bed there's me in the mirror um so this is my bed and then I cannot remember where I got the mirrored nightstand tables um I have no idea I got them some years ago but we can go through everything so first a little over to my side table and these big white mirrors I got these at HomeGoods and I love them again I think I totally know I got these lamps at HomeGoods also I got a matching one over there and then over here um I have a DIY on how to make these flower balls I also got this pink Eiffel Tower you'll see another one on my dresser I got those at Target they were like a Valentine's Day thing this is definitely a home goods purchase this vase this I got at a little antique flea market this little glittery crown and then these flowers I got at I think I got at Pier one or I got them at Michaels crafts and I just cut them up and put them at different heights in that little guy because I just love flowers and then we move over to let's go down to this little footstool thing so this little footstool bench this pink chair and also my pink couch I got at a custom furniture making place I can't remember what they're called but then this headboard I got at room service LA and it's velvet and I had the color I hadn't custom do this color and you can pick swatches it's like we're your interior designers go to basically like design furniture for room so you pick the color swatches you want and then you pick that to be made and it takes like a few months but I feel like it's worth it because I love this it is like my one of my most favorite pieces of furniture I've ever purchased in my life I just feel like a princess sleeping in this bed and I love it I love it so so so so so much also the little bali light guys I got those at Target they're just rows floret lights and then if it's two sets of them I just like them I just think they look fun and they light up at night and it's like really glowy at night and I love

this is my TV where I don't watch too much TV in here but this is my dresser so this dresser has a tail I bought him and I was gonna paint all white so I started to paint him light in these pink drawers and that was right before I had Ellie and then I like went into labor to have her a couple of days later so I never finished it it has handles this is so embarrassing and like I have my nail polishes and stuff in here but these obviously I can't open because they don't have the handles the door and it has little doors to close I need to go find those again but here on my dresser I have these candle holders these cool metallic candles I have no idea where I got them I cannot remember and this glittery one I got at a gift shop a long time ago so these I've had forever from Pier one

things like I had a phase where I went through for a long time kind of where I would just like men's pants they would look oh grandpa pigs they were like old plaid polyester pants I love them and I also love like old men's looking sweaters and jackets so I would go to thrift stores I would look for scarce lots of polyester shirts i wore back then big overalls um lots of bagging men's pants which i still love today photos show you guys what i found a so first i went to the memos Trading Post which is one of my favorite places to go to ever every Sunday so I got this like this military cape ok see it but if we do this he's like he's really cool I got this asymmetrical thing and then he's got like this cool collar that couldn't it just like super cool I love this I had to haggle with my price on that too because I just didn't have enough cash I got these overalls are from um I think the 50s he said I'm gonna have to show you guys look at how cool these overalls are look at the back is super cool these are awesome and they have like cool patches on the back I love those I got this like pink silk robe that I thought would be super cool to wear with like a t-shirt and some boyfriend jeans or if I just need to robe to get ready while I'm doing videos it's like a cool vintage robe oh my gosh I got if you guys know I already have a rolling stone shirt that I wear all the time that I cut the sleeves off but I got him because I can like distress me though he smells horrible wait till you see my tips on how to make things smell better because he definitely needs that and then I got this kind of looks like a bowling shirt and then I just got it because it says West Covina and that's where like that's where my parents are from that's where they met um I grew up there when I was a little child so if you're from West Covina and this nose ring is totally fake just like a fun accessory like anything else you wear um but I know you guys asked where I got these like little knuckly ring things these I also got at the Melrose trading post at the Vita cush um booth look what I got for $10 these glasses you can do like in my life and everything in there I will never lose these if you buy $10 glasses you never lose them if you got expensive one you'll lose in the first time you wear them then it's a wasteland which is like a vintage II store and I got this cool it says it's a sample I'm sure this is just super Polly doesn't smell weird he's just like pretty and I got him then I got this hat wait till you see this hat look at the size of this hat is this amazing or what I'll just show you the tips on how to clean this lip it's just like a gigantic ginormous hat I love it so when you shop at the thrift stores or flea markets or anything you get things like really cool one-of-a-kind things that really help create your style and make you stand out that way you don't look like everybody else that we bought all their stuff at forever 21 owners are or wherever you shop where everything looks the same you can have a really unique print on your own clothes because you have like one-of-a-kind pieces and just look for things that you're I like gravitate towards like I was like what is that Pink's that neat shiny I have to have another what is this giant size hat so whatever you think is fun and I'll always like like old Levis old boyfriend

shopping and you get things like really feels like it's way less than if you go to the store anyway so that Omaha now on to my five tip for vintage flea market thirst or shopping and making your things smell amazing I'm gonna give you guys my five tips for vintage thirst or or flea market hunting number one is if you buy jewelry these earrings are one of my favorites I've had these for years and I got these at the Melrose trading post you can disinfect them in rubbing alcohol or you can just buy these little hooks at like a craft store and just put a whole entire new hook which is what I like to do the best also it's good to get new backs especially if they're post because the backs will be a little loose to tip too if you buy a hat like this hat which I got and I totally love you can take a disinfecting wipe wipe the inside spray disinfecting spray and the Sun also kills all kinds of funky bacteria and smells you can leave it out in the Sun for a few hours tip number three places to hunt for treasures if you live near an area where you know like wealthier people live like I would go to the thrift store in Beverly Hills because wealthy people are going to get rid of designer things and I have found many designer things in a thrift store things that were probably hundreds of dollars and I got for like $3 so go to the wealthy areas to look for some designer things for a few dollars tip number four shoes sometimes you just see a pair of vintage shoes II you gotta have like these boots that I got on eBay that are a little too small but I keep them because I think maybe my feet are gonna shrink these are so cool I think I'd appear like this when I was like seven or eight and I was just like I love them I feel like I love them just like when I was seven but if you buy a pair of these boots or any shoe if you get a high heel what you want to do is also take those disinfecting wipes wipe the bottom really well we're getting disinfecting spray to spray inside that's what they do at bowling alleys to kill all the germs in there and then I definitely get like a gel insole liner that way you're stepping on brand-new bottoms for your feet so it's kind of like a new shoe and you disinfected it and it's pretty darn these are 20 like 20 25 bucks on eBay tip number five is going to be how do you make your clothes smell amazing I don't know why but people always ask me like what laundry detergent and software do I use cuz I guess when I give hugs and stuff my clothes smell good so I'm going to share with you guys my personal laundry blend that we've got to go on a little field trip to my washroom so are you ready to go get your parents permission on a slip and we're going to take a field trip to my laundry room so welcome to my laundry room if you guys didn't know I move and I got a new washer and dryer the guy at Home Depot gave me really bad instructions on washing with this so I partnered with time they taught me what I was doing wrong and they even send me free soap so I'm going to teach you guys what they taught me if you have a high-efficiency one it uses less water so you can't use the regular amount of soap because that makes too much bubbles and they're not going to smell clean so this you just use the pods and like if you're using a regular size you use one pod or if I'm watching like a larger load I put in two pots and that's how it comes out smelling good there bubbles like collapse quicker with the little amount of water so it's better for the environment it saves time saves water all those things and your clothes smell better because it's not making all this foamy stuff and it just gets out the stains the stink everything from my clothes so that's what I use I use two of these pretty much all the time unless I barely throwing anything in there and then I use this in spring meadow so this is number one and then I also put in the downy UNSTOPABLES in spring also because this smells amazing and sometimes I even mix it up I also have the downy UNSTOPABLES in dazzle so sometimes I'll put a little dazzle and a little fringe like I'm making a special mixture of sense and then this is kind of new this is the unstoppable premium scent booster with fabric conditioner and lush this smells so good so what I do I fill up the little cap of this lush guide this smells so good I would like wear this as a perfume and then I fill the cap up with ease and I'd like to do it sometimes before the filter ring because it just makes the fun sound are you ready ahh sound so fun to me I'm just gonna put in the one pod otherwise I would put in two and then I'm just gonna wash these two rides together these two guys moisten them for colors and then start and therefore this note or anything so that was it guys make sure you stay tuned because I am going to have more t-shirt cutting videos some just dressing shirt videos and one how to make a t-shirt into a really cute dress thing so make sure you subscribe you get notified whenever I upload a video you can follow me all over the internet candy Johnson kan de Johnson that's what my parents named me all over Twitter Facebook snapchat Pinterest everywhere you go you'll find me at that name and remember wear whatever style that you love don't feel like you have to change who you are or be like anybody else you stand out and shine you'll be a pink treat in a forest of green wear what you like and don't let anybody stop you or make you feel like you can't shine and be who you are and if somebody does make fun of you you can listen to my grandmother's advice that always told me if somebody makes fun of what you're wearing just tell them just be glad you don't have to wear it and you wear what you love whatever makes you happy these earrings make me happy that's what my style is whatever makes you happy that is what your style is also and go out into the world and shine it and no I would cheer you on and celebrate people's differences in their styles not everybody has to look the same I love enjoying and appreciating other people's styles that are different and unique the world would be so boring if we all looked alike so small-minded

it to look like kind of like a soft watercolor soft focus effect around the eye in color so I'm just blending this all over with the finger then I'm going to take this color in 7:40 and those little brush comes riding the tap so we're going to do the outer corners of the eye and the inner corners of the eye this is very key to the halo eye Trin you want both the outer and inner corners darker and the center we're going to keep highlighted I'm also going to do the outer corners of the lower lash line then take your smoky eye brush and this is going to really blend in a more perfected manner than just doing it with our fingers would I want this the inner corner the crease and the outer corner blended really really well I'm even going to take a concealer brush and this is flatter and wider so it's going to spread the color out into a wider area we're really going to get into that crease now and that's just a little brush that comes with the cream eyeshadow and you're just going to soften up then I'm going to take this color and 750 which is a white pearl shade and I'm going to dab this right on the middle center of the top pilot this isn't romantic a little romantic Colorstay palette and the pink take your pinky and tap that right on the center where we just put the pearl color this is going to build up that real halo like glow then I'm going to take the color stage two and one clear gel pencil and it has a flat edge perfect for lining the waterline and perfect for getting a really straight edge liner that you can also blend to because on the other end of the eyeliner is a little brush which we're going to use to smudge and blend this color really well so it gets that really kind of deep dark color right at the lash line then we're going to take our pre shadow brush and that peak color again and do the inner corners and put a little more pinky blow up on top to never blend enough curl down lashes curl down lashes both lashes then I'm going to take the Revlon Volume Mascara and this big fluffy brush I'm going to use on top to get big voluminous lashes up top I want to add a little more truth so I'm getting this photo ready pallet and water colors and this beep purpley color and I'm just going to go right in the crease with my angled brush really get the outer crease and even dab on the inner crease and the more color you build the more you get to add the more layers you add the more you're adding more depth to your look so I'm doing the inner corners of the lower lash line then I'm going to take the ultimate all-in-one Revlon mascara look at this cool little wand so I'm really going in the lashes and this gives you really clean long lashes I'm even adding another layer to the upper lashes then make it this color say brow crayon this is a great waxy formula that really folds your eyebrows into shapes so I drew them on then I took my angled brush and got some right from the pencil and really work to get all the brows into shape and define the lines a little bit better then I'm going to take the Revlon insa blush in candy kiss because I just want to buy everything that's names can be so you just kind of blend it on and again you're just going to blend it away and create a soft focus really pretty glowy Chi I'm taking the Oh baby pink blush and I'm using using the blush brush that came with it to just soften the edges and really set the color so it's going to give more proof to the cream I'm going to take the photo-ready insta-fix highlighting stick put it right up there on the cheekbones and I mean we're going to draw down the center the nose and you can do the tip to the nose if you like then do the Cupid's bow this will create a bigger fuller lip make your nose look more straight and glowy and then I'm taking the Revlon Ultra HD lip colors these smell and taste so delicious I'm using embrace and production the two colors I mix together then I'm taking the Revlon Colorstay with liner in nude and I never do a lip color without a lip liner like ever ever ever so I'm just lining defining giving shape to the lips it gives shape to the lips just like eyeliner does to your eyes and I'm also going to take another little pinky full of this pink shade and tap a little bit more halo eloah on the very center of the eyelid then I also want to take the Revlon Colorstay lip liner in soft pink and it is a beautiful pinky like lip highlighting color and I'm just kind of filling in the edges and the top of the Cupid's bow part which will make our lips look very full also so that was it guys look how

basically all you need so get that stuff out you can come and do your makeup with me and I will show you how we do it so I hope you have fun doing this let's get started and we'll go back to me not having any makeup on are you ready Wow okay so the first thing we're gonna do is put some music on and we're listening to the copyright free royalty-free station on YouTube I don't know if this is too loud but I have to have music when I put makeup on or it seems like very boring so the first thing I already did was I already put the primer on and a trick to primers is you want to put them on before and let them loose too loud you had to be a little quiet buddy okay and if anybody wants to know what song this is I don't know I'll put in the comic : okay so this is the Marc Jacobs primer and you want to put this on and let it like do its work for like ten minutes so don't just put primer you always want to let it sit and kind of like activate and plump up and do all the stuff to the skin so I put that on like ten minutes ago now we're going to put the foundation and I'm using the Clinique beyond perfecting I'm mixing the colors this is golden neutral and cream chinois um just to mix it because he's a little like too yellow for me and then he's like a little more normal and let me know I don't know if these lights are too bright I'm trying to figure out the lighting for you guys where it's perfect but I don't know because different computers and monitors are going to see things different by mixing equal parts of these two colors I might put the links below the video I don't know it's so much work for me to put the links for every product I use but let me know if that helps you guys if you do like the links below I will put that down below so I'm going to mix like equal parts of these to mix the best shade of foundation use a beauty blender mix these on me hand and then we're going to start putting this on here to cover up all of my freckles I do love freckles on everybody else but for my foundation I just like full coverage I like it look like I'm perfect doll with perfect skin uh-huh even though I don't have perfect skin that's the beauty of it this is seriously my favorite foundation if I do a favorite this month it's going to be in there for sure with some other things but it'll definitely be in there also whoops we ran out more makeup more makeup I just need to look like I got so much makeup on just kidding it really doesn't look like it once you put it on that's the beauty of it did our forehead and I will remember today to do the UM getting so worried about for to do the contouring which the last video I did of this my everyday makeup look I totally forgotten that I put it on on top of my powder which it came home looking okay but it's not really the order you should be doing things in and this you don't even really need concealer this just does such a good job I love it we got a blend wait which is the right color this is the trim shim wall if you go to like a department store or even support they will match your skin tone Sephora has this cool thing we're like they use this little computer to like match your skin tone so if you go there they'll just give you like what color you wear in every move all over your brand and this lighting is still let's get an itch in my nose this goes up with the foundation on wait is that the end of our song I'm going to have to do this every time ha ha I guess so are these all the copyright sounds let's hear what this song sounds like I mean I've never heard this before we will listen for the first time together okay we gotta hurry up it was already taken minutes just to get our foundation on but if you're following along with me well this is how long it usually really takes me okay I do like this song okay so we are doing that now we're going to do I might just put a little this is the cap on the locket concealer in medium I'm going to just put a little under the eyes and on the eyelids just because I like extra coverage here kind of acts like a primer you really want to get like a good base of no skin redness coming through underneath that's good perfect now it's time to powder I'm just using any translucent powder because you want to set your makeup if you don't put powder if you just put your foundation on all of your makeup is going to come off because it's too oily it's going to slip off you have to set it and if you want to do we look then just use like a more creamy foundation to lock the moisture in underneath but you have to set this okay put dry shampoo and now it's not like a white clump in my hair that looks really great so again oh my gosh are you kidding me I totally forgot to do the contour before I just get so excited about setting my foundation okay so this is if anybody wants to know the match mastic concealer in number eight it's way darker than my skin tone but this is what you want to use to do a little bit of contour you see this you don't have to do this every day I'm just going to show you guys because I feel like it does make a difference so we got that good thing I didn't didn't touch the forehead yet I cannot believe that oh boy blender ooh this music is very fun it feels like a potty I hope you guys are doing your makeup along with me it's like we're just hanging out doing makeup along with your good friend candy I was gonna say can do so but I don't know I thought what's going to come out then did it nosey I promise you and I'm not talking this goes a lot faster I don't know if you guys follow me on you now but it's like live streaming and I did a couple live streaming putting a makeup on there the only not good thing is I have I do it on my laptop so it's not like as clear but it is fun I love it and then I can talk to you guys and ask you things and it's just so fun I want to put a little bit of concealer as highlight down the nose whoa like that now we're gonna add more powder on top oh no now we gotta get a new song oh this is the hardest part let's hear let's hear cartoon we lose I don't know we'll hear what all these songs are later and now we're gonna walk all this in with I found it John now it's not going anywhere I'm going to need the eyes I believe the eyelid salute our eyeshadow goes on smoothly on our chin we don't really can all you know okay now this I feel like the foundation takes all ghosts okay now we're done I don't know let's pipe address now we're going to do now I like to go in hula this is my favorite bronzer as you can see by how worn out it is and I just kind of go over the same areas that I just put the cream with because for more power you always want to put a powder of whatever it was over the cream it just gives you more impact and beauty favorite blush with a long time what kind of this is love cloud from Max I just love this color and I really hope it's not like one of those temporary or like colors that gets discontinued because I just it's like the most beautiful light slush without looking like whoa crazy crazy cheek colors and then I'm really loving this NYX blonde femme this little pink highlighter I just put it like kinda right on the very tops of the cheeks like that for a little glow and then my favorite highlighter I'm love what loving this Kevin maquon candlelight might be the most beautiful highlighter ever in the whole world a lot of highlighters are like - I just smash my West bursts out and then you just go right here on the cheekbones a lot of highlighters are too sparkly and shimmery and they look kind of crazy when you put them on this is so finely milled it's like you just don't know why your cheek bone looks so right and I just love that playing it down the center of he knows and I love the cumin below love it I love it now I'm going to use this is the Gwen Stefani palette which I have you can use any colors you do not have to use these same colors if I am using but I'm just going to show you what to I'm using meself so this color in blonde this highlight any highlight shimmery color will work and I'm just going to go in the inner corner and get this V on here and then we're going to go up here this is also into my favorite brushes - this is from my friend choice or rock this is I love this brush like nobody's business this brush is just amazing so that's our highlight color then I'm going to take this color this is an Anaheim just like kind of Toki like taupey brown and I'm going to go right into the crease you don't have a crease you just kind of make that color there and it'll make it look like you have a crease and then I blend up like that 44k what other color do I don't know I just had a little Martin to mix these with the star color what is he done we're done with that song maybe we'll play it again because I kind of like it alright let's do it again I do that with all my favorite song so I just play them over and over again I don't know why okay so we're getting a little bit of that start color I'm going to go underneath the brows me likey likey and I feel like a thinner brush like this dinner I might go back in here with a little bit of this zone this Brown and then it's like like taupey color work him into the crease a little more for a little more impact soften him up on a brush with absolutely nothing I think that's all we're going to do on those guys now I'm going to get this is talked the torch is clay paint liner which I love and then this is just a royal langnickel 1/8 brush from the craft store which these are way cheaper than makeup brushes and they are actually like cushiony stuff here so just go to Michael's and buy yourself a craft brush or Hobby Lobby or wherever then I got this then we're going to you get a little you squirt amount like in this little wooly thing come on buddy and then I just load him up on the brush like this and we're going to start wait what I never use these sponge tip guys unless it's to smooth out up in the corner I don't use these for application ok so now we're going to start in the middle well he's late thicker than I wanted him to be like I need to face this I can work for you guys good like I just know what I'm doing and hold it up to the side goalie in a corner and go in here know if it's wobbly or something Doyle we're going to go back in with eyeshadow and fix it we're going to decide where we want our wing at ooh I got some on my favor he's going it all over my face then I just always scrape it off and make sure it's really flat in the center so you get a good wing shape let's see where do we want our wing today maybe right here and just do it really light at first I have a smaller we want to do and make up so fast like this I can't talk when I knew it well one length done tap for a number to beat them out of this little show that you can use whatever you want I I'm just liking this one right now there's a middle coming down to the corner I don't go all the way down what that song is over already mmm what should we listen to what was the last song called it was called don't play it was called different heaven by Nico Zilla we'll play that again I think we liked it

going to wing it oh my gosh I didn't realize all the make up in the background so this was all make up the Kat Von D Sydney and I did a haul of it and I had it arranged really pretty like I took all of the lids off and set all the lipsticks up by color and then I only thought she was helping and before I took the pictures she put them all the caps back on proud of them all up so I got to do that again in the background so that's why that looks like that back there okay now let's do this and I mess up on the wind all the time so if you feel like you do too you are not alone my most famous

we'll do we'll do our eyebrows okay I have been loving this dark brow brow a little brow beater brows so we're gonna fill in on brows with this guy whoops not looking at my brows so I go up here up here go across the top like this go from this arch down and just catch him in honey to the bottom and I just fill it all in between go up here it's like I am your makeup coach and you take this bully side and go up and over perfect now we got this guy to do like start here the core man up and you want to hold your eyebrows skin taut otherwise your pencil sketches are going to go and move with the skin so you want to hold it still like I'm doing with my finger and filling in oh my gosh not a different song again let's hear this Firefly song who knows what it sounds like but we're going to hear it if it's back we'll just change it spooley side up and boom bah boom they are whoops that's not the right side put the cat for him I'm over here this Tarte lights camera lashes still my favorite mascara we're going to put 25 million coats of this on whoo-hoo something bright early I think I actually need to buy another one too I think I'm running out yeah he needs a new one yes I do have a shopkins bandaid on my finger Oh can't talk I'm down here you want to screenshot my mascara face that's a good one it's a bhoot one there we go see this is when I'm editing I cut all this out because nobody wants to see two minutes of me putting mascara on and I put my head back like this so that I don't blink and get it on my eyelids you could do I'm not even looking in the mirror that's how perfect all right when I was about to say that's how professional I am I get it right on my eyelid I was just joking but pride comes before a fool okay I think that's good now I got to cover up that Blanca love eyeshadow I'm gonna get someone highlighter right there I'm going to put him just like you never happened I'm actually using a sponge tip applicator I don't know where this came from or why it's on my table actually now we'll do our lips okay so I'm going to be using I have three different Reds here umm this lime crime red velvet color people ask for a dupe for this color which is like the most perfect awesome red so I'm going to show you guys it dupe for that which is American doll from on estancia family Hills I see it every time if you guys watch me on snapchat you've seen it I don't know I just was the UH Nastasia bubbly who knows when I say that name so we're gonna take us on first ah Christmasy sorry guys moment of silence while I do my lips we're going to finish it with liner because you could never just do this liquid lip if you're doing a bright red you have to define it with a lip liner and make sure that it's pretty sharp this is cherry from Mac it is the most perfect red lip liner in all of the world I have used it for ten billion years and will use it for ten billion more I just love it so we sharpen it then I over draw my lips sue me lip police then I do stay in the lines and giggle with rebel ready bottom it is done what that song is done already I don't know we liked it let's just hear one more time okay that is Jim yosef Firefly what I see is what's called I don't remember the lipliner will soften because when you use the liquid lips you can create like a way to harsh or wiggly line it looks like too much paint it on so this just softens it if you use the lip liner red lipliner is regular super perfectionist like imma keep trying keep trying keep trying Twizy toy straight rude to go now let's do another 25 coats of mascara and we are almost done any time you do red lips it takes way longer we're almost coming to the home stretch guys hang in hang on we are almost done what am i doing there was like a little wonky guy now normally if I'm really normally on a daily basis I don't really wear makeup every day actually so um I am I thought hey I'll put makeup on and I'll make a video for it so this is like my go-to red lip color but and if you're like oh my gosh you take oh don't you tripped alone to put your makeup on everyday I don't actually put makeup on everyday what in the world I have smeared it underneath my oh my gosh if you smear your eye makeup take a little bit of concealer on your B render like this I can't believe I just did that and dab it away like an eraser oh my gosh you know why why did this happen because I normally like to put the HD powder it has more silicone in it so when you put the silica underneath your eye makeup doesn't stick it sweeps off much easier than regular powder and Eifert whoa that recording was so long it said we'd stop recording so I had to do hit record again there we go now you're not going to stick if only I had remembered to do that in the first place you like the smoke is still coming up from it okay I want to put eyelashes on because I just think it looks fun when I actually do this makeup look even though I don't really wear the lashes every to the holiday glue Telos glue I don't wanna I don't want to know how you pronounce it I should like google it or some cool I got glue in here what a good little eyelash person AK oh these are the flutter

hi guys it's candy and this is kind of a historic video because this is my very first video film in my new house so this is going to be like a life update video and probably like all kinds of other information like some things going on what's going on why I haven't been able to upload a video in a long time and I just wanna be like really real with you guys and just share some things not I don't want you guys be like oh my gosh I feel so bad for her she try to make me feel bad for her this is not about that I just wanna be real to you guys and let you know some things I'm going through and that you guys feel okay if you're going through them through - because we're human beings nobody has a perfect life and nobody's like has perfect things where nothing goes wrong so I just want to share my heart with you guys for a little bit um before I get to that the story of me moving the things that I've been going on okay so first I want to tell you guys about something so cool so in my very next video you can go to my Instagram and you can see a sneak peak it is just sneak peep sneak peek candy Johnson is just my name on Instagram you can see a sneak peek of the video but I was asked to star in the new Too Faced better than sex that's the name of their mascara waterproof film it's like a mini film there was a script the storyline add costumes wait until you see the costume is not in the sneak peak you have to wait for the reveal but that I'm gonna upload on my main channel so you guys can see April 3rd it's going to go up so mark your calendars to come back April 3rd and see the full-length video just wait till the end to see what happens it was so amazing I had thousands literally thousands of tombs of mascara on me he was amazing the founder of two-faced Jerrod Blandino and Jeremy they are so amazing someone who are amazing them beyond makeup they're just amazing human beings I cannot wait you guys to see this video you're two-faced proof mascara so exciting ok so let's get on to moving and all that stuff so if you guys didn't know if you do not follow me on snapchat or Twitter Facebook or Instagram you you should probably do those things because you stay up to the minute and I just post things on there all day long different things on all of and a little bit of stuff about moving and the little difficulties and things going through a little bit so I just want to fill you guys in so basically I moved and I'll tell you guys in this story so I was born in Southern California lived here moved up to Lake Tahoe later in life move back down till I moved like all over the place but the gist of the story is I moved back to LA to start my makeup career long many years before YouTube stuff so my career was going really great there my parents started a company and they needed my help with it so they asked if I move home and health and I would do anything for my parents and I was like okay I'll move but the whole entire Drive like the seven and a half hour drive home I pretty much cried the whole way because I thought um I am like kind of never gonna go after my career anymore because I'm just going this is LA is where you do your career and there is not where I'm willing to be doing my makeup artistry career so driving the whole way home crying some moments in your life are like a slingshot moment where you get pulled backwards and you're going backwards in the total opposite direction of your life whether it's a dream a relationship career wherever you think you're going after and you feel like you're going backward the wrong way this was what I was feeling like but I had no idea that in that moment the slingshot moment was I was being pulled backwards so far but then I was going to be catapulted so much farther than where I was so the reason I got into makeup was I love making women feel beautiful I loved seeing them actually feel beautiful not just look beautiful but feel beautiful and women in my makeup chair were always like oh I wish you could teach me all the kind of things so I went through some rough times definitely when I moved back to Lake Tahoe so I had a friend it showed me lauren luke panacea 81 this is so many stories it's not just moving this is like how I got started in YouTube also so I was like this is amazing I love her I could be the US version of her then I found of other girls were doing in the u.s. I was like okay I'm gonna do but I can teach my makeup tips and tricks cuz everybody asked me I don't know how to do makeup I wish you could teach me I was like now I can teach everybody that watching my youtube videos even though like nobody's watching much time I thought that would be like an awesome idea so I started YouTube and then I started getting letters pouring in that this was inspiring women it was more than the makeup that it was inspiring them making them feel beautiful um girl that it said helps save her life and I've gotten so many emails about that and that is like the greatest thing let me just do my makeup career in LA ever could have been so all this time since I moved back there I'd wanted to move back to LA so I'd been praying that I could move there and like nothing's working out and I was like I just want to be there I don't understand traveling back and forth was getting really really hard on and then I realized later that God didn't answer my prayer for a reason because if you guys didn't know this is like so many stories upon stories more stories if you guys didn't know my dad was killed um pretty tragically a few years ago uh he was supposed to pick me up from the airport on the way to the airport I got the call that my dad went to be in heaven um and that was very hard my heart and it do you tube or really anything for a little while um and what I realized though and God not answering my prayer to move me to LA I got to stay there and make so many memories with my dad that I wouldn't have gotten if I had moved to LA earlier so I am so thankful for prayers that not that they're unanswered God just has better timing and says look I got a better a better bigger plan for you just hang on with me around this road you can't see the curves ahead but I always got something bigger and better for you I always have something bigger and better for your life so um fast forward into now to being able to move so then there was like this crazy series of circumstances so I was like okay I can move and then my landlord he also passed away which is very sad because I really liked him and then his family had decided they were going to sell the house that I was living in so they're like we're going to give you like a couple months to move out but still like a couple months is not how much time so then I found this house and you guys I am so honored to say that I got to buy my first house because I have worked three jobs at a time I have worked since I was 16 years old I have been working and just saving hoping to buy a house for so many years and the fact that I'm able to to provide a little home for my family and say that I bought us a house a little place we can make memories and I could paint the walls whatever color I want is just it's like a dream come true to me because I never ever ever thought this would happen in times of my life when I was like I can't even afford to pay rent how am I ever gonna afford to get a house um so I just want to encourage you guys if that's your dream keep working hard keep going after those things and do not give up on your dream even if your dream is to buy a house and paint the wall there because you want to so I got this house um it needed a lot of work like a lot of renovation and some things need to be fixed for sure um so we thought that that was going to be ready when we moved out of the other house but that life was totally it not the case so they only went to move here like floors weren't ready a lot of things were ready at all so literally the moving truck was delivering and unloading the truck I had to go get a separate u-haul truck to then load the things that the moving guys are unloading into the moving truck go find a storage unit and then put everything in storage so I really just have like a couple suitcases I've been living out of so if anyways like I keep seeing you wear the same shirts on snapchat well cuz I've only have like three that I keep washing over again so um so that's been really exciting and then we first tried to sleep here um the heat the heater wasn't working though I don't know if though the hot water wasn't working electricity wasn't like all through the house so there's definitely some challenges and then we've had things like flooding a couple things flooded upstairs flooding downstairs we had to do more work than we thought once we got started realizing like oh cool that doesn't work and this is not this is means to be totally fixed so it's been an adventure for sure I can't wait to show you guys so this fireplace is like the only thing that's like done in the house right now and this I got like a few hundred dollars at like this Antiques place it was like going on a business and I was like I don't know where it's gonna go but I just want this mantel thing so then we got they put it in here and it looks it's like princess fairy tale like I want it out of here I want to take that mantle with me because it's so much um so then I moved here so that just like a lot of other things were going wrong like so many things I wouldn't even have time to tell you guys in a video but I'll tell you like a few of some of them um so one was um I really was missing my dad like a lot Oh wah wah and I miss him every day but like all of these things that were going on I just wanted to be able to call my dad I just want to talk to him and have him like encouraged me and he was always so inspirational encouraging and I was just missing him so much but a lot of things my heart was just heavy for so many reasons and I think it feel it makes me feel like I wish I could talk to my dad more in those times and there's like no phone I can call him in heaven and then that part just makes my heart hurt a little bit you know so I was missing my dad it turned on Pandora to like the 70s Pandora station because it reminds me of like my dad like seventies rock music and one of his favorite songs came on that was Creedence Clearwater Revival bad moon rising and I was I just felt like it was my dad I'm not gonna cry I've cried so much the last couple weeks um that my dad would be like I am there with you um so I cried a lot the last few weeks and it's been hard like Oh reason why they couldn't make a video so when I got here they have been working here at this house like pretty much seven days a week so all during the day this is late at night that I'm filming this and I'm hoping the Lighting's okay I don't know if my lighting equipment is packed away like most of my filming equipment is packed away it could even find the battery for my camera like a lot of things were going on um and then there's like sawing and hammering that's so loud I can't fill in a day I got a finger something out so that's been really really challenging and hard and then just a lot of situations were going on right it's just feeling so down like I just felt like I couldn't even make a video because you guys would know that it wasn't like your normal candy because I was just my heart just felt so heavy with so many things um so my mom had to put our little family dog and he was really sick and she had to take him to be put to sleep and that was really hard because if any of you guys have pets like your family and I feel like I don't even know if I could have a pet again because it's so hard to lose one of them you know so that was really sad um one of my family MERS got into a car accident they're okay but that was uh it's just like a stressful thing that you're worried about and then um and then I was doing some health things so the day that I moved out of the house I said like oh I was hidden like I mean not to be crazy but I'm so like all the time it was not good at all really bad stomach pains all kinds of other symptoms really bad and they lasted for like a few weeks it was being weird and I know like I work I've always had a really strong work ethic like I would work and work and work and not really care about myself I'll just like I just want to focus on taking care of everybody doing what I have to do and self seven somebody's upset I will stay until a hole over late or not sleeping to comfort them and um and then I forget to take care of myself so if you guys know like I've gone to the emergency room like a few times the last couple of years and I've never like followed up any of the doctor's appointment they said to follow up with the specialist for things I just haven't done next I've been like I'm too busy I don't have time so I know I need to take care of me and then part of me is like I don't want to go the doctor like it is a facilities thing like I don't want to find out something wrong but I need to find out such a strong case is so that's like one weird thing about me another weird thing is when things really are upsetting to me but I don't talk to anybody about them like I just hold it on this side and I feel like I don't want to waste people's time with feelings I don't want to waste time talking about it over and over and over again so I keep a lot of things when I'm upset to myself and I don't know if you guys if any of you guys do that too but um I know that that's not good because sometimes you need to talk and other people will comfort you and give you that advice I just feel like I never want to bother anybody everybody always thinks I'm so up and positive so it seems weird for people to know that like oh she could have a sad moment which I do a I'm human being everybody's human I'm gonna be sad again I want to feel like crying and depressed that's just life I know that's gonna happen again I'm not like I don't have feeling right now my robot everything is wonderful like I get those feelings in their sad um so I was hit with like oh so much crying you guys like I I was just feeling so overwhelmed like just so many things were hitting me and so much more stuff was going on I won't but no wanna waste everybody's time and tell them all the other things going on it was like a lot of things we're feeling with my heart was just hurting for so many reasons why um and then one of my friends invited me that he works with Nick voyage kitchen if you don't know who he is he was born without arms like he's the most inspiring persons I think is on the planet right now he is so amazing and I went to go hear him speak just hearing him talk about him dealing with being bullying him wanting to commit suicide me was Ted from bullying the kids bullying him for not having arms and legs and and him going through the things where he serves he walks he does these things and does not have arms legs he I mean he is so amazing he's full of so much joy and life and you feel the love when he's speaking to you you feel that he has got love that like more than human you feel it in your heart and he's amazing and I just listen to him speak and so many things that he said just spoke to my heart that you know you looked at things that are a strong person nobody is that strong of a person because they're all weak and they're all they're imperfect humans you know and he just reminded me like we can't put our hope and joy in temporary things that we have we're taking care of our family we have a home some people look at fame or success or money and that makes them feel like that's what they're hoping for and for him just to remind me that he was saying you know these temporary things only get temporary joy and are long lasting joy and this is what I believe also is that that is what is in heaven that is where the perfection of everything this world is not perfect it's a little hurt it's full of hurt people people that want to hurt other people awful depressing sad hopelessness horrible things all the time and that our home our true home this is what I believe in my heart we don't play this is to Luke it that my hope is in heaven and that I hope that my heart is so full of God joy that even when I'm going through these are awful things I have hope that I know that God is there to still love me with the only perfect level ever get on this planet that perfectly you know they're going to be make mistakes they're gonna be jealous hurt your feelings all those kind of things and God will never do that he just loves me more than anything if he loves you more than anything and just to be reminded of that was just what my heart needed so much because I was just feeling like I was just thinking and I was not me and I was just feeling so depressed and down and sad and I was like I can't even fill videos nobody wants to see what I'm even filming about because I just feel so sad right now and it was just overwhelming so many things would like hit me overwhelming in life in different directions I was like I can't handle all of this stuff you know and that's when I know that like I just heard next week and it was so amazing go follow him on Instagram Facebook everywhere Nick boy checked out put links below was just so amazing and I hope that he encourages you guys because he encouraged me on a daily basis just on his Facebook is amazing um so those are the things that have been going on then there's just been like fun little things aren't really problems like oh my gosh I can't decide on the wall color I need to paint walls because I'm not renting and I get to pick a color and I keep going to the paint store I pick a billion clones my paint like looks like a mosaic on my wall and then I feel like a crazy person because I'm staring at my walls me like I don't even know what color is the color and and being a makeup artist like I noticed the slightest change in a hue so I got literally I don't know like 15 shades of pink paint a wall and I still could decide like I don't know which Pink's my favorite that was too like that to write that with you blowing my indecision I'm super indecisive and that is the worst thing to do pick paint colors or many things in life I'm working on a lot of projects that like aren't on YouTube stuff and sleeping just like a 2 or 3 maybe 4 hours a night is not good for great and sound like have talked or you have okay ever there were in your brain um so I've been working on my walk if you guys want to go see my blog channel it's candy land just my name candy land and I'm gonna try a new blog hi and that we know artists I'm trying to do it daily like my day is so crazy I just feel like it'd be better if a camera crew follow me around to film it because I'm doing something carrying things doing stuff I can't go it off so I'm gonna try to do like Oh weekly once a week let me know in the comments what day do you want me to do that wha what day would you guys like that and I also filmed a video um so in my old house I didn't even feel like a full house tour the only house to resolve my Christmas house tour um but I did feel a bedroom tour because that bedroom I did love it it feels like I was inside a Faberge egg and I got all kinds of cool treasures of mortals and I did film a room tour that so if you want to see that room to her I forgot to upload so my hair it goes before I cut my hair off and comment below if you want to see the room to just comment want to see the room tour need to see the room tour whatever you want because it's going to be a while before this bedroom is done I'm not really sure when the house is going to be done or how many phone videos cuz they're if they're here every day I'm like hammering sawing I cannot film a video with that noise I don't even know where my lights are buried I'm not even all of our stuff is here I have been taking a shower and I dry off with a kitchen towel cuz we don't even have all of our towels here so it's really been like camping and and I don't want to go by the towel about a little color I'm gonna paint the bathroom walls and stuff so it's been really exciting and we did send in another kitchen so we don't have like food or anything where to put stuff so it's not going to be done eventually and it's gonna be awesome and I'm so thankful it is I'm so thankful I'm back in LA again so if you see me around LA anywhere make sure you let me hug you and squeeze you and I just love it so much I know my dad would be so proud and um and just if you guys are going through a hard time if you are going through a time where you feel sad you feel hopeless you feel like nothing is going your direction where there's a relationship problem money problem career from a family problem illness problem loss of a loved one problem whatever it is know that there is a perfect plan for you and I wrote a blog post um I haven't written on my blog in like so like 9 10 months or something I used to write every day for 7 years I wrote every day on that blog and um and then to take a break because the doctor like you got to cut some things out because you are not resting and sleeping on stuff so um but I've been there's been a yearning in my heart like I love writing to encourage people I love I just miss writing like funds and collections of blog posts and weeping pictures of things so you go to can Jenna calm I wrote one about diamonds and this came still amazingly because diamonds the pressure it takes to make a diamond it's like it's 100 thousands of pounds per square is a pressure and like 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit if heat on carbon like so many thousands of feet below the earth the pressure and the sheet are what turned that carbon into a sparkly priceless diamond and that's what our life is like that's what those struggles in our life are like it's the heat it's the pressure it's all those things that turn a little not very cool looking carbon miss into a sparkly and beautiful diamond and sometimes the greatest the most amazing people that I know are the ones that have been through the hardest most difficult things because it's like their sparkle becomes their heart because they can love other people so big they have so much understanding empathy they can comfort other people because they've been in that pain before and if you're going through those things just know that that is the pressure and the sheet making you more priceless sparkly diamond in this life I just want to encourage you guys that I have bad days they're hard yes I try to be positive being positive is enough when you feel like you're crumbling and falling and depresses me like I need to be more positive that is not going to help you and I know this is I'm not trying to be preachy to you guys or you guys could totally feel different than me but for me my hope is in Jesus and just pray to him asking God please just take this burden a weight of this pressure and sadness and all these things and through my heart with your joy and made my joy overflow to other people and when you comfort and love other people it makes your heart feel so much better and there's meaning in it there this life is meaningless if your life is just like Oh what kind of shoes do I have or how many like did I get on Instagram or house in E&amp;I or how popular and I are how much money do I have what kind of car do I Drive or all I'll only be happy when I get this card this we need followers or this this or that that means nothing and it's empty and it always leaves you wanting more so you get that cool designer car you're gonna want the newer fancier version that comes out in another couple years you get a cool purse you're gonna want the next one that comes up if you're always going to be watching more more more more MORE you're never going to be fully joyful based on those things yeah I'm going shopping fun putting in new lipstick that's one what that is it's something that pulls you out of a deep depression of hopelessness it's just like oh this is fun for a minute and you want to have that joy this you can still smile and be joyful to other people and not become bitter not hold unforgiveness in your heart so you're going around the people that hurt you and now you're feeling extra angry because you're holding on to that anger and I'm like they hurt you and and feeling hurt about so many things I want you guys to feel joy and have it overflowing and I just wanted to share that with you guys we felt the last few weeks and things I've been going through I mean it's always so much more than what I was able to share with you guys right now the things that I've been going through some things you have to keep near and dear and protect those to your heart sometimes I don't even talk to anybody about those things just in real life that I know I I know that God was those heartaches in there and sometimes that's good enough for me that I don't I don't have to go telling everybody what what is like no um I did miss my dad and I did just really want to hug sometimes um but I know I will get that in heaven one day and if you guys see me until like coma hug me cuz everybody needs like 20 hugs for emotional well-being a day that's what they say I say you could you could have Morris if you see me hug me 10 25 times I don't care I would love it um
